Using zebrafish, we compared the effectiveness of three different OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF), diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) on survival, AChE inhibition and larval motility. We conclude that at equimolar concentrations CPF is the most effective OP of the three tested. 300nM CPF inhibited AChE when measured at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) by 80%, which correlated to a 35% decrease in larval motility when measured at 6 dpf. We isolated the cDNA of zfkcc2 , which encodes for an important cation-chloride cotransporter responsible for establishing a chloride gradient that allows for the neurotransmitter GABA to become inhibitory for a subset of neurons. By isolating the cDNA of zfkcc2 , we were able to characterize its expression pattern up to 4 dpf. Using qRT-PCR, we showed that the expression of zfkcc2 rises from 2 to 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). The expression of zfkcc2 is found at 1 dpf in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain in a distinct pattern. By 3 dpf, zfkcc2 expression is found throughout most of the developing zebrafish brain. We were then able to characterize the expression pattern of zfnkcc1, which encodes for a cation-chloride cotransporter that works opposite to zfkcc2 and establishes a chloride gradient allowing GABA to be excitatory during development. Expression of zfnkcc1 is found at 1 dpf throughout most of the developing zebrafish head including in some non-neural tissue, but appears concentrated to the otic vesicle at 3 dpf. Using double in situ hybridization, we investigated the nature of the developmental switch from zfnkcc1 to zfkcc2 by looking at regions where there was an interaction between both genes’ expression patterns in the developing zebrafish nervous system. We preliminarily examined how affecting nicotinic signaling with exposures to nicotinic agonists/antagonists can affect the expression of zfnkcc2 and zfkcc2 . While there were no apparent changes in the expression pattern from any of the exposures at 2 dpf, we found that by 3 dpf nicotine and CPF exposures resulted in an incomplete expression pattern for zfkcc2 that seemed to be delayed. However, the expression of zfnkcc1 at the otic vesicle was unaffected by exposure. Our results suggest that disrupting nicotinic signaling during development can affect the expression of an important cation-chloride cotransporter, zfkcc2 , that plays a major role in establishing the necessary chloride gradient for the proper functioning of GABA during development. Future studies should focus on investigating the nature of the developmental switch between zfnkcc1 and zfkcc2 to see if the possibility of their regulation being coupled is a target for exposures.</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Manu""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Excluded"", ""Manu""=>""Excluded""}",,Pesticides;zebrafish,,

Als zusätzlicher interagierender Faktor wurde der Einfluss von Sauerstoffmangel auf die Toxizität von Substanzen miteinbezogen. Zur Untersuchung von komplexen Interaktionen wurde das Räuber-Beute-Verhalten zwischen Zebrabärblingen und Chironomiden-Larven (Chironomus riparius) analysiert. Einen weiteren Teil dieser Arbeit bilden Untersuchungen mit komplexen Kohlenwasserstoff-Mischungen in Form der water accomodated fraction von Rohöl und deren Auswirkungen auf das Verhalten von marinen Amphipoden (Corophium volutator), ebenso wie Halbfreilandversuche mit Süsswasseramphipoden (Gammarus pulex). Meine Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass Effekte verschiedener Substanzen auf Amphipoden und Fische auf verschiedenen biologischen Organisationsebenen und in umweltrelevanten Konzentrationen auftreten. Es konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass abiotische Parameter die Wirkung von Schadstoffen modifizieren. Bei der Untersuchung von Schadstoffmischungen mit gleichen oder unterschiedlichen Wirkmechanismen war in der Mehrheit der Fälle eine additive Wirkung der kombinierten Stressoren zu beobachten, die in der Regel auch für alle untersuchten Parameter (Enzymaktivität, Bewegungsaktivität, Entwicklungsstörungen, Mortalität) konsistent vorhanden war. Auswirkungen des neurotischen Insektizids Chlorpyrifos auf Interaktionen zwischen Fischen und Chironomiden konnten in umweltrelevanten Konzentrationsbereichen detektiert werden. Die Wirkung der water accommodated fraction von Rohöl, die ein großes Problem für aquatische Organismen in Küstenlebensgemeinschaften darstellt, konnte durch Änderungen im Verhalten des marinen Amphipoden Corophium volutator angezeigt werden. Für die kontinuierliche Überwachung der Gewässerqualität an Monitoringstationen hat sich der einheimische Bachflohkrebs Gammarus pulex als geeigneter und relevanter Testorganismus erwiesen, da er auf komplexe Schadstoffmischungen im Oberflächenwasser sensitiv reagiert. Insgesamt haben sich Verhaltensparameter in der vorliegenden Arbeit als integrative, relevante und sensitive Parameter bei den verschiedenen Fragestellungen bewährt, die auch zur Analyse von interspezifischen Interaktionen dienen können. Zur Beurteilung der Auswirkungen von Schadstoffen auf Organismen in der Umwelt sollten abiotische Parameter und Mischungen von Chemikalien miteinbezogen werden. Des Weiteren sind biochemische Messungen, ebenso wie Verhaltenstests, wichtig, um die Toxizität von Schadstoffen adäquat beurteilen zu können. Für ein integriertes Verständnis der Auswirkungen von Chemikalien auf aquatische Organismen sollte daher eine Batterie verschiedener Methoden, ebenso wie realistischere Expositionsszenarien berücksichtigt werden. ; In this work, the effects of various single substances (pesticides and metals) as well as binary mixtures of them on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae were assessed on biochemical, developmental, and organism levels. The influence of oxygen depletion on the toxicity of substances was included as an additional interacting factor. To analyse complex interactions, the predator-prey behaviour between zebrafish and chironomid larvae (Chironomus riparius) was investigated. Another aspect of this work were studies on complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as the water accommodated fraction of crude oil, and their effects on the behaviour of marine amphipods (Corophium volutator), as well as semi-field experiments with freshwater amphipods (Gammarus pulex). My investigations showed that effects of various substances in environmentally relevant concentration ranges are exerted on different levels of biological organisation, both in amphipods and fish. It could be shown that abiotic parameters modify the effects of pollutants. When investigating mixtures of substances with similar or different modes of action, additivity occurred in the majority of cases which usually were consistent for all investigated parameters (enzyme activity, locomotor activity, developmental impairment, mortality). Effects of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos on the interactions between fish and chironomids could be detected in environmentally relevant concentration ranges. The effects of the water accommodated fraction of crude oil which represents a great risk for aquatic organisms in costal habitats were displayed by alterations in the behaviour of the marine amphipod Corophium volutator. For a continuous monitoring of water quality in monitoring stations, the resident amphipod Gammarus pulex proved to be a suitable and relevant test organism, as it responds sensitive to complex mixtures of pollutants in surface waters. In summary, behavioural parameters proved to be integrative, relevant and sensitive parameters for the different research topics/questions in the present work, and can also be recommended to be used to analyse interspecific interactions. To judge on the effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms in the environment, abiotic parameters as well as mixtures of pollutants should be included. Additionally, biochemical measurements as well as behavioural tests are important, to adequately assess the toxicity of pollutants. Therefore, for an integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms, a battery of different methods as well as more realistic exposure scenarios should be taken into account.</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not english | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",,Biochemistry;MixTox model,,
