TI  - Fipronil and 2,4-D effects on tropical fish: Could avoidance response be explained by changes in swimming behavior and neurotransmission impairments?
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Brazil is the largest producer of sugarcane, a crop largely dependent on chemical control for its maintenance. The insecticide fipronil and herbicide 2,4-D stand out among the most commonly used pesticides and, therefore, environmental consequences are a matter of concern. The present study aimed to investigate the toxicity mechanisms of Regent (R) 800 WG (a.i. fipronil) and DMA (R) 806 BR (a.i. 2,4-D) pesticides using forced and non-forced exposures through an integrative approach: firstly, to assess whether contamination by fipronil and 2,4-D can trigger the avoidance behavior of the fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Hyphessobrycon eques (serpae tetra or mato-grosso). Additionally, the effects on fish were analyzed considering the swimming behavior together with a biomarker of neurotoxicity, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In avoidance tests with pesticide gradients, D. rerio avoided the highest concentrations of the two compounds and H. eques avoided only the highest concentration of 2,4-D. The swimming behavior (distance moved) was reduced and AChE was inhibited when D. rerio was exposed to fipronil. The 2,4-D affected the swimming (maximum speed) of H. eques, but AChE was not altered.Avoidance response seemed not to have been affected by possible effects of contaminants on swimming behavior and Ache activity. This study showed the importance of knowing the avoidance capacity, swimming behavior and neurotoxic effects of pesticides on fish in an integrated and realistic context of exposure in environments contaminated with pesticides and can be useful as ecologically relevant tools for ecological risk assessment.

TI  - Propiconazole induces abnormal behavior and oxidative stress in zebrafish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The use of pesticides has been growing along with the demand for agricultural products. These compounds, however, are not restricted to the field, spreading easily through the soil, contaminating groundwater and reaching urban centers. Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that has been increasingly used in agriculture. However, there are few data about its effects on non-target organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of propiconazole in zebrafish. The animals were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of propiconazole (425, 850, 1700, 8500 ng/L), then submitted to the novel tank test for behavioral analyses. The brains were collected for evaluation of oxidative stress parameters. Exposure to propiconazole (1700 and 8500 ng/L) decreased the number of crossings, entries, and time spent in the top, and increased the time spent in the bottom area of the tank. We also observed an increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in zebrafish brain exposed to propiconazole at 425, 850, and 1700 ng/L. We conclude that propiconazole alters normal fish behavior and disrupts oxidative status. More studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the effects of propiconazole on non-target-organisms.

TI  - Sublethal effects of propiconazole on the metabolism of lambari Deuterodon iguape (Eigenmann 1907), a native species from Brazil
T2  - FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the sublethal effects of propiconazole on Deuterodon iguape, a native fish common in Brazil, which has potential for aquaculture and use as a bioindicator. The hypothesis was to test whether D. iguape has a metabolism similar to Danio rerio so that its use in bioassays may be validated. Lethal concentration (LC50) and metabolic rates were studied in fish exposed to propiconazole. Specific oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion for D. iguape and D. rerio increased by 0.01 mu g L-1 and then decreased as the propiconazole concentration increased. The decrease in the averages of specific oxygen consumption at the concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1 represented a reduction in the metabolic rate compared to the control of 71% for D. iguape and 40% D. rerio. For the ammonia excretion, at the same concentration, there was a reduction of 68.7% and 45.4% for D. iguape and D. rerio, respectively. When comparing ammonia excretion of the two species for each concentration of propiconazole, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in relation to the control and for the highest concentration (0.1 mu g L-1). As for specific oxygen consumption, there was a statistically significant difference only for the concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1. D. iguape proved to be a good and useful bioindicator for ichthyologists or ecologists in studies of moderate pesticide contamination in freshwater aquatic environments, as its metabolic response was similar to D. rerio.

TI  - DDT exposure of zebrafish embryos enhances seizure susceptibility: relationship to fetal p,p'-DDE burden and domoic acid exposure of California sea lions.
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: California sea lions have a large body burden of organochlorine pesticides, and over the last decade they have also been subject to domoic acid poisoning. Domoic acid poisoning, previously recognized in adult animals, is now viewed as a major cause of prenatal mortality. The appearance of a chronic juvenile domoic acid disease in the sea lions, characterized by behavioral abnormalities and epilepsy, is consistent with early life poisoning and may be potentiated by organochlorine burden. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the interactive effect of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on neurodevelopment using a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model for seizure behavior to examine the susceptibility to domoic acid-induced seizures after completion of neurodevelopment. METHODS: Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to either o,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) during neurodevelopment via a 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide solution. These larval (7 days postfertilization) fish were then exposed to either the seizure-inducing drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or domoic acid; resulting seizure behavior was monitored and analyzed for changes using cameras and behavioral tracking software. RESULTS: Embryonic exposure to DDTs enhanced PTZ seizures and caused distinct and increased seizure behaviors to domoic acid, most notably a type of head-shaking behavior. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that embryonic exposure to DDTs leads to asymptomatic animals at completion of neurodevelopment with greater sensitivity to domoic acid-induced seizures. The body burden levels of p,p'-DDE are close to the range recently found in fetal California sea lions and suggest a potential interactive effect of p,p'-DDE embryonic poisoning and domoic acid toxicity.

TI  - Do you smell the danger? Effects of three commonly used pesticides on the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Fish are warned about the presence of predators via an alarm cue released from the skin of injured conspecifics. The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

TI  - Synergistic effects caused by atrazine and terbuthylazine on chlorpyrifos toxicity to early-life stages of the zebrafish Danio rerio
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - This study examined the effects of three widely used pesticides that have been previously detected in aquatic systems neighbouring agricultural fields on the early-life stages of the zebrafish Danio rerio. Tests involving single exposures and binary combinations of the s-triazine herbicides (atrazine and terbuthylazine) and the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos were performed. Several endpoints, such as swimming behaviour, morphological abnormalities and mortality, were studied. In addition, the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was investigated in order to evaluate the mode of action and toxicity of chlorpyrifos in the presence of these herbicides. Results indicate that both binary mixtures elicited synergistic responses on the swimming behaviour of zebrafish larvae. Moreover, although the herbicides were not effective inhibitors of the AChE on their own, a synergistic inhibition of the enzyme activity was obtained by exposure to mixtures with chlorpyrifos. We observed a correlation between impairment of swimming behaviour of the larvae and inhibition of AChE activity. This study supports previous studies concerning the risk assessment of mixtures since the toxicity may be underestimated when looking only at the single toxicants and not their mixtures.

TI  - Glyphosate- and Fipronil-Based Agrochemicals and Their Mixtures Change Zebrafish Behavior
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Environmental contamination caused by the human occupancy and economic activities that generate a wide range of contaminated effluents that reach natural water resources, is a current reality. Residues of agrichemicals used in plant production were detected in different environments and in different countries. Among these agrochemicals, we studied a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH), a fipronil-based insecticide (FBI), and their mixtures (GBH + FBI). Zebrafish exposed to 3 and 5 mg/L of GBH spend more time in the top zone and less time in the bottom zone. Fish exposed to 0.009 and 0.018 mg/L of FBI spent less time in the bottom zone, whereas zebrafish exposed to the three GBH + FBI mixtures spend more time in the top zone compared with unexposed control fish. This clear anxiolytic pattern, in an environmental context, can directly impair the ability of fish to avoid or evade predators. We concluded that both glyphosate-based herbicide and fipronil-based insecticide and their mixtures alter zebrafish behavior, which may result in significant repercussions on the maintenance of the species as well as on the food chain and the ecosystem.

TI  - Comparative Lipid Peroxidation and Apoptosis in Embryo-Larval Zebrafish Exposed to 3 Azole Fungicides, Tebuconazole, Propiconazole, and Myclobutanil, at Environmentally Relevant Concentrations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Azole fungicides have entered the aquatic environment through agricultural and residential runoff. In the present study, we compared the off-target toxicity of tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using embryo-larval zebrafish as a model. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative toxicity of tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using multiple-level endpoints such as behavioral endpoints and enzymatic and molecular biomarkers associated with their mode of action. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoles at environmentally relevant and high concentrations, 0.3, 1.0, and 1000 mu g/L, starting at 5 h postfertilization (hpf) up to 48 hpf, as well as 5 d postfertilization (dpf). Relative mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 family 51 lanosterol-14 alpha-demethylase, glutathione S-transferase, caspase 9, phosphoprotein p53, and BCL2-associated X protein were measured to assess toxicity attributable to fungicides at the mRNA level, whereas caspase 3/7 (apoptosis) and 3,4-methylene dioxy amphetamine (lipid peroxidation) levels were measured at the enzymatic level. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was measure through the Mito Stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 at 48 hpf. In addition, light to dark movement behavior was monitored at 5 dpf using Danio Vision (R) to understand adverse effects at the organismal level. There was no significant difference in the light to dark behavior with exposure to azoles compared to controls. The molecular biomarkers indicated that propiconazole and myclobutanil induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and potentially apoptosis at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 1 mu g/L). The results from the mitochondrial respiration assay indicated a slight decrease in spare respiratory capacity with an acute exposure (48 hpf) to all 3 azoles at 1000 mu g/L. Based on the present results, propiconazole and myclobutanil are acutely toxic compared to tebuconazole in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations.

TI  - Behavioral, molecular and physiological responses of embryo-larval zebrafish exposed to types I and II pyrethroids
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Pyrethroids are potent neurotoxicants that may elicit multiple pathways of toxicity in non-target organisms. Comparative studies on the mechanistic and developmental effects of types I and II pyrethroids against non-target aquatic species are limited. This study assessed the effects of the two pyrethroid types against embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at environmentally relevant and laboratory concentrations. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to type-I (permethrin, bifenthrin) and type-II(deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, fenvalerate, esfenvalerate) pyrethroids at 1000,10, 0.1, 0.01, 0.0 mu g/L, starting at 5-h post-fertilization (hpf) through 5-d post-fertilization (dpf) under static exposure conditions. Swimming behavior (distance traveled and velocity) was assessed at 5-dpf. The relative expression of Nrf2a, GST, Casp-9 and p53 mRNA transcripts, carboxyl esterase (CES) activity and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. The stability of the pyrethroids across 5 days was analyzed. Bifenthrin-(10 mu g/L) and esfenvalerate-(1000 mu g/L) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total distance traveled by larvae while 1000 mu g/L deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin were lethal causing body axis curvature and pericardial edema. At environmentally relevant concentrations-(mu g/L) compared to control, permethrin-(0.122) upregulated Nrf2a and Casp-9 expressions while lambda-cyhalothrin-(0.053) downregulated Nrf2a and fenvalerate-0.037 downregulated GST. At laboratory concentrations-(mu g/L), permethrin-(1000) upregulated Nrf2a, Casp-9 and p53 expressions, bifenthrin-(10) upregulated Casp-9 while fenvalerate-(0.1) and esfenvalerate-(1000) downregulated GST. There was concentration dependent increase in CES activity which correlated positively with total ROS. Pyrethroid concentrations decreased significantly by day 5. This study showed disparity in the mechanistic effects across the pyrethroids types and their instability in aqueous media may underestimate toxicity against non-target aquatic species when exposed in their natural environment.

TI  - The toxic effects of deltamethrin on Danio rerio: the correlation among behavior response, physiological damage and AChE
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - Pyrethroid pesticides constitute one of the main types of pesticides in the domestic market. Deltamethrin, one of the typically used pyrethroid pesticides, has high insecticidal activity, and a wide insecticidal spectrum, and is widely used in agricultural production and other activities. A previous study showed deltamethrin to have obvious toxic effects on zooplankton, fish and other aquatic organisms. In the current work, we used fish of the model organism Danio rerio to comprehensively evaluate the effects of deltamethrin on their behavior, physiology and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. During the initial reaction of the fish to the presence of deltamethrin, their behaviors were found to change with the drug concentration, which directly showed the toxic effect of this pesticide on the fish. The AChE activity of the fish showed a response similar to that of their behavior. Moreover, deltamethrin caused significant damage to their gills and liver. However, being major organs of Danio rerio, the gills and liver showed a different response pattern than did the behavior of the fish.

TI  - Adult exposure to insecticides causes persistent behavioral and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Farmers are often chronically exposed to insecticides, which may present health risks including increased risk of neurobehavioral impairment during adulthood and across aging. Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 mu M CPF), with short- and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity, tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at 14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses. Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at 14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point. These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a lowcost model that has a variety of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.

TI  - Developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of synthetic organic insecticides in zebrafish (Danio rerio): A comparative study of deltamethrin, acephate, and thiamethoxam
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Synthetic organic insecticides, including pyrethroids, organophosphates, neonicotinoids and other types, have the potential to alter the ecosystems and many are harmful to humans. This study examines the developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of three synthetic organic insecticides, including deltamethrin (DM), acephate (AP), and thiamethoxam (TM), using embryo-larval stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Results showed that DM exposure led to embryo development delay and a significant increase in embryo mortality at 24 and 48 h post-fertilization (hpf). DM and AP decreased embryo chorion surface tension at 24 hpf, along with the increase in hatching rate at 72 hpf. Moreover, DM caused ntl, shh, and krox20 misexpression in a dose-dependent manner with morphological deformities of shorter body length, smaller eyes, and larger head-body angles at 10 mu g/L. TM did not show significant developmental toxicity. Furthermore, results of larval rest/wake assay indicated that DM (>0.1 mu g/L) and AP (0.1 mg/L) increased activity behavior with different patterns. Interestingly, as an insect-specific pesticide, TM still could alter locomotor activity in zebrafish larvae at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L Our results indicate that different types of synthetic organic insecticides could create different toxicity outcomes in zebrafish embryos and larvae.

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Pyrethroid and organochlorine insecticides are enormously used to control agricultural and indoor insect pests. The metabolites of pyrethroid and endosulfan were used to evaluate environmental toxicities using a representative animal model, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos in this study. The LC50 values in 3-phenoxy benzoic acid (3-PBA) and endosulfan sulfate (ES) were 1461 mu g/L and 1459 mu g/L, respectively. At the concentration of 2000 mu g/L, spine curvature was observed in the ES-treated embryos. ES showed seizure-like events with an EC50 value of 354 mu g/L. At the concentration of 1000 mu g/L, the pericardial edema was observed in 3-PBA-treated embryos. The inhibition of heart development and the reduction of beating rates were observed in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) embryos after the exposure to 3-PBA. Down-regulation of the vmhc gene coding ventricular myosin during heart development was significantly found in 3-PBA-treated embryos at 48 hpf, but recovered afterward. It indicates that ventricular malformation occurred at the initial stage of 3-PBA exposure. Considered together, both 3-PBA and ES need public concerns with periodic monitoring of these metabolites in households and agricultural areas to prevent humans and environmental organisms from their unexpected attacks.

TI  - Sub-lethal effects of the triazole fungicide propiconazole on zebrafish (Danio rerio) development, oxidative respiration, and larval locomotor activity
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide used in agriculture. Via run-off, it can enter the aquatic environment, and can adversely affect organisms. However, data are scarce on how propiconazole may affect early developmental life stages of fish. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of propiconazole during zebrafish development. Wildtype zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to propiconazole (0.1-100 mu M) for up to 150 hours post fertilization (hpf) depending upon the endpoint measured. Propiconazole decreased survival and induced hypopigmentation in fish at 100 mu M compared to the water and solvent controls. Pericardial edema was also noted in embryos and larvae (beginning at 2-3 dpf) exposed to 100 mu M propiconazole. To visualize the effects of propiconazole on the circulatory system in more detail, we exposed transgenic zebrafish (globin-LCR:eGFP) to the fungicide. Hematopoietic changes were observed within 48 h of exposure to 100 mu M and localization of blood cells in the cardic region became diffuse, indicating pooling of blood in the pericardial region. We measured oxidative respiration in embryos as sufficient ATP is needed for development. Exposure to 100 mu M propiconazole (similar to 6-30 hpf) reduced basal respiration (similar to 50%), oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration (similar to 70%), proton leak (similar to 30%), and non-mitochondrial respiration (similar to 50%), indicating compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. A Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was used to measure dark photokinesis behavior in larval fish exposed to propiconazole for a 6-day period. Larval fish exposed to the highest concentration in the assay (10 mu M) showed evidence of hypoactivity. This study demonstrates that propiconazole can induce hypopigmentation in zebrafish, disrupt mitochondrial bioenergetics, and can alter locomotor activity. However, these sub-lethal responses were observed at concentrations above what is typically detected in the environment.

TI  - Behavior responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to aquatic environmental stresses in the characteristic of circadian rhythms
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - As behavior shows a distinct circadian rhythm, it is hypothesized that circadian rhythms based on zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior responses could be affected by contaminants in this study, and then the behavior strength of zebrafish exposed to 0.005 mg/L Cadmium chloride (CdCl2), 0.01 mg/L Dibasic Sodium Phosphate (Na2HPO4), 0.002 mg/L deltamethrin, and 0.003 mg/L atrazine for 6 days is used to illustrate the possibility of behavior circadian rhythms as an indicator in the environmental stress assessment. Statistical analysis with p < 0.01 shows that a clear difference between average values of BS during dark period (AVD) and those during light period (AVL) could be observed, and 24 h circadian rhythms do exist in zebrafish behavior responses. Both BS values and circadian rhythms of zebrafish can be affected in the aspect of periodicity with clear time delay, which were 1 h delay in CdCl2, 4 h delay in Na2HPO4, 4 h delay in deltamethrin, and 1 h delay in atrazine. Behavior circadian rhythms were disturbed according to the repetitive cycles after autocorrelation analysis, and the toxic effects of different chemicals could be reflected by the profiles of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which indicated the circadian rhythm disorder in different degrees. These results deduced from the statistical analysis, autocorrelation and SOM strongly supported that circadian rhythms based on zebrafish BS could be used as an indicator in the environmental stress assessment.

TI  - Developmental exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin alters transcription of mTOR and ryanodine receptor-dependent signaling molecules and impairs predator avoidance behavior across early life stages in inland silversides (Menidia beryllina)
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Altered transcription of calcium-dependent signaling cascades involving the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in response to environmental exposures have been described in model vertebrates, including zebrafish, while the relevance for wild fishes remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed the euryhaline model species Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to the insecticide bifenthrin, a known modulator of calcium signaling. The main objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether exposure of developing silversides to environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin alters their behavior; and (2) whether behavioral changes correlate with altered expression of genes involved in RyR and mTOR-dependent signaling pathways. At six hours post fertilization (hpf), inland silversides were exposed to bifenthrin at 3, 27 and 122 ng/L until 7 days post fertilization (dpf, larvae hatched at 6dpf), followed by a 14-day recovery period in uncontaminated water. Transcriptional responses were measured at 5, 7 and 21 dpf; locomotor behavior following external stimuli and response to an olfactory predator cue were assessed at 7 and 21 dpf. Bifenthrin elicited significant non-monotonic transcriptional responses in the majority of genes examined at 5 dpf and at 21 dpf. Bifenthrin also significantly altered predator avoidance behavior via olfactory mechanisms with main effects identified for animals exposed to 3 and 27 ng/L. Behavioral effects were not detected in response to visual stimuli during acute exposure, but were significant in the predator-cue assessment following the recovery period, suggesting delayed and long-term effects of early developmental exposures to bifenthrin. Our findings demonstrate that at picomolar (pM) concentrations, which are often not represented in ecotoxi-cological studies, bifenthrin perturbs early development of inland silversides. These developmental impacts are manifested behaviorally at later life stages, specifically as altered patterns of predator avoidance behavior, which have been correlated with population decline. Collectively, these data suggest that bifenthrin may be negatively impacting wild fish populations.

TI  - Anxiety-associated behavior and genotoxicity found in adult Danio rerio exposed to tebuconazole-based commercial product
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The effects of different concentrations of commercial product based on tebuconazole, on adults of Danio rerio, were evaluated through novel tank diving test and micronucleus and comet assay tests. A total of 320 adult D. rerio were divided into eight tanks and exposed to concentrations of 0; 100; 200 and 300 mu g/L the commercial product based on tebuconazole, with their respective replicates at 24, 72 and 96 h. The results showed a behavioral deviation of zebrafish and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in DNA damage as a function of exposed time and different concentrations of the commercial product in relation to the negative control. The results obtained in this study allow to conclude that tebuconazole has effects on adults of Danio rerio, inducing geno-toxicity and mutagenicity, as well as altering neurological functions related to the change in the behavior of adults.

TI  - Bifenthrin causes transcriptomic alterations in mTOR and ryanodine receptor-dependent signaling and delayed hyperactivity in developing Check for zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Over the last few decades, the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin has been increasingly employed for pest control in urban and agricultural areas, putting humans and wildlife at increased risk of exposure. Exposures to nanomolar (nM) concentrations of bifenthrin have recently been reported to alter calcium oscillations in rodent neurons. Neuronal calcium oscillations are influenced by ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity, which modulates calcium-dependent signaling cascades, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. RyR activity and mTOR signaling play critical roles in regulating neurodevelopmental processes. However, whether environmentally relevant levels of bifenthrin alter RyR or mTOR signaling pathways to influence neurodevelopment has not been addressed. Therefore, our main objectives in this study were to examine the transcriptomic responses of genes involved in RyR and mTOR signaling pathways in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin, and to assess the potential functional consequences by measuring locomotor responses to external stimuli. Wildtype zebrafish were exposed for 1, 3 and 5 days to 1, 10 and 50 ng/L bifenthrin, followed by a 14 d recovery period. Bifenthrin elicited significant concentration-dependent transcriptional responses in the majority of genes examined in both signaling cascades, and at all time points examined during the acute exposure period (1, 3, and 5 days post fertilization; dpf), and at the post recovery assessment time point (19 dpf). Changes in locomotor behavior were not evident during the acute exposure period, but were observed at 19 dpf, with main effects (increased locomotor behavior) detected in fish exposed developmentally to bifenthrin at 1 or 10 ng/L, but not 50 ng/L. These findings illustrate significant influences of developmental exposures to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin on neurodevelopmental processes in zebrafish.

TI  - Lethal and sublethal toxicity of abamectin and difenoconazole (individually and in mixture) to early life stages of zebrafish
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - In recent years, the need for the development of alternative test methods for the conventional acute fish toxicity test (AFT) with adult fish has often been discussed. In addition, concerns have been raised on the potential risks related with environmentally realistic pesticide mixtures since risk evaluations have traditionally been based on individual pesticides. The insecticide/acaricide abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole are the main pesticides that are intensively used in Brazilian strawberry crop and are hence likely to occur simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the lethal and sublethal toxicity of single and mixture exposures of these pesticides to zebrafish early life stages (embryos and juveniles). By comparing the derived toxicity data of the individual compounds with that previously determined for zebrafish adults, the order of life stage sensitivity was juvenile > adult> embryo. The pesticide mixture revealed a dose-level dependent deviation of the independent action model, with antagonism at low dose levels and synergism at high dose levels. Sublethal parameters (especially those related with locomotion) were considerably more sensitive than lethality. Subsequently, the inclusion of sublethal parameters may greatly improve the sensitivity of FET tests and hence its suitability as a substitution of adult fish testing in risk assessment evaluations.

TI  - A mixture of fipronil and fungicides induces alterations on behavioral and oxidative stress parameters in zebrafish
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Pesticide commercial mixtures, including the insecticide fipronil and the fungicides pyraclostrobin and methyl-thiophanate, have been used in concomitant pest control, facilitating agricultural management. Their widespread use can lead to soil and water contamination and potentially induce damages in the ecosystem, producing toxic effects in non-target organisms. Despite their toxicological potential, their effects on behavioral and biochemical parameters are not well understood. Here we investigated the effects of the mixture of fipronil and fungicides (MFF) pyraclostrobin and methyl- thiophanate on behavioral and biochemical parameters of oxidative stress in adult zebrafish. Animals exposed to the highest MFF tested concentration showed a decrease in the total distance traveled and in the number of crossings in the different zones of the tank. Furthermore, animals exposed to highest MFF tested concentration spent more time in water surface. In addition, our data showed that the exposure to this preparation promoted a decrease in non-protein thiol content as well as in catalase activity. Finally, pesticide exposure induced an increase in the superoxide dismutase/catalase ratio. Our results indicate that alterations in behavioral and oxidative parameters are involved in MFF toxicity in zebrafish. The antioxidant mechanisms analyzed were altered in concentrations that did not affect zebrafish behavior. Therefore, the assessment of oxidative stress parameters in zebrafish brains could be very useful to detect the early effects of environmental exposure to the MFF.

TI  - Exposure of Larval Zebrafish to the Insecticide Propoxur Induced Developmental Delays that Correlate with Behavioral Abnormalities and Altered Expression of hspb9 and hspb11
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Recent studies suggest that organophosphates and carbamates affect human fetal development, resulting in neurological and growth impairment. However, these studies are conflicting and the extent of adverse effects due to pesticide exposure warrants further investigation. In the present study, we examined the impact of the carbamate insecticide propoxur on zebrafish development. We found that propoxur exposure delays embryonic development, resulting in three distinct developmental stages: no delay, mild delay, or severe delay. Interestingly, the delayed embryos all physically recovered 5 days after exposure, but behavioral analysis revealed persistent cognitive deficits at later stages. Microarray analysis identified 59 genes significantly changed by propoxur treatment, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that these genes are involved in cancer, organismal abnormalities, neurological disease, and hematological system development. We further examined hspb9 and hspb11 due to their potential roles in zebrafish development and found that propoxur increases expression of these small heat shock proteins in all of the exposed animals. However, we discovered that less significant increases were associated with the more severely delayed phenotype. This raises the possibility that a decreased ability to upregulate these small heat shock proteins in response to propoxur exposure may cause embryos to be more severely delayed.

TI  - Fish Aversion and Attraction to Selected Agrichemicals
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - In agriculture intensive areas, fishponds and natural water bodies located in close proximity to these fields receive water with variable amounts of agrichemicals. Consequently, toxic compounds reach nontarget organisms. For instance, aquatic organisms can be exposed to tebuconazole-based fungicides (TBF), glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), and atrazine-based herbicides (ABH) that are potentially dangerous, which motivates the following question: Are these agrichemicals attractant or aversive to fish? To answer this question, adult zebrafish were tested in a chamber that allows fish to escape from or seek a lane of contaminated water. This attraction and aversion paradigm was evaluated with zebrafish in the presence of an acute contamination with these compounds. We showed that only GBH was aversive to fish, whereas ABH and TBF caused neither attraction nor aversion for zebrafish. Thus, these chemicals do not impose an extra toxic risk by being an attractant for fish, although TBF and ABH can be more deleterious, because they induce no aversive response. Because the uptake and bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish seems to be time- and dose-dependent, a fish that remains longer in the presence of these substances tends to absorb higher concentrations than one that escapes from contaminated sites.

TI  - Salinity Changes the Dynamics of Pyrethroid Toxicity in Terms of Behavioral Effects on Newly Hatched Delta Smelt Larvae
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Salinity can interact with organic compounds and modulate their toxicity. Studies have shown that the fraction of pyrethroid insecticides in the aqueous phase increases with increasing salinity, potentially increasing the risk of exposure for aquatic organisms at higher salinities. In the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD) estuary, pyrethroid concentrations increase during the rainy season, coinciding with the spawning season of Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered, endemic fish. Furthermore, salinity intrusion in the SFBD is exacerbated by global climate change, which may change the dynamics of pyrethroid toxicity on aquatic animals. Therefore, examining the effect of salinity on the sublethal toxicity of pyrethroids is essential for risk assessments, especially during the early life stages of estuarine fishes. To address this, we investigated behavioral effects of permethrin and bifenthrin at three environmentally relevant concentrations across a salinity gradient (0.5, 2 and 6 PSU) on Delta Smelt yolk-sac larvae. Our results suggest that environmentally relevant concentrations of pyrethroids can perturb Delta Smelt larvae behavior even at the lowest concentrations (<1 ng/L) and that salinity can change the dynamic of pyrethroid toxicity in terms of behavioral effects, especially for bifenthrin, where salinity was positively correlated with anti-thigmotaxis at each concentration.

TI  - Atrazine and Diuron Effects on Survival, Embryo Development, and Behavior in Larvae and Adult Zebrafish
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Atrazine and Diuron are widely used herbicides. The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled, mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were not altered. Our results highlight the need for further studies on the sublethal effects of both herbicides and the consideration of the effects of commercial formulas vs. isolated active ingredients. It also emphasizes the need to take sublethal effects into consideration when establishing the environmental limits of residues.

TI  - Combined treatment of melatonin and sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate reduced the neurological and cardiovascular toxicity induced by deltamethrin in zebrafish
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin has been reported to have an effect on vertebrate development and cardiovascular disease. Sodium tanshinone HA sulfonate (STS) is considered to have cardioprotective effects and melatonin is known to regulate sleep-waking cycles. In this experiment, we used transgenic zebrafish Tg (kdrl:mCherry) and Tg (my17:GFP) to investigate whether STS and melatonin could reverse the cardiovascular toxicity and neurotoxicity induced by deltamethrin. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 25 mu g/L deltamethrin at 10 hpf and treated with 100 mmolil. STS and 1 mu mol/L melatonin showed that deltamethrin treatment affected normal cardiovascular development. In situ hybridization and qRT-PCR results showed that deltamethrin could interfere with the normal expression of cardiovascular development-related genes vegfr2, shh, gata4, nkx2.5, causing functional defects in the cardiovascular system. In addition, deltamethrin could affect the sleep-waking behavior of larvae, increasing the activity of larvae, decreasing the rest behavior and the expression of hcrt, hcrtr, aanat2 were down-regulated. The addition of melatonin and STS can significantly alleviate cardiovascular toxicity and sleep-waking induced by deltamethrin, while restoring the expression of related genes to normal levels. Our study demonstrates the role of STS and melatonin in protecting cardiovascular and sleep-waking behavior caused by deltamethrin. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neurobehavioral anomalies in zebrafish after sequential exposures to DDT and chlorpyrifos in adulthood: Do multiple exposures interact?
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - A sequence of different classes of synthetic insecticides have been used over the past 70 years. Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at 14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses, anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach, predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not 3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing responses in the predator test showed fleeenhancing effects of both compounds individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.

TI  - Residual molecular and behavioral effects of the phenylpyrazole pesticide fipronil in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) following a pulse embryonic exposure
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS
AB  - Pesticides are typically applied to crops as acute applications, and residual effects of such intermittent exposures are not often characterized in developing fish. Fipronil is an agricultural pesticide that inhibits gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) gated chloride channels. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 48 h (starting at similar to 3 h post fertilization, hpf) to various concentrations of fipronil (0.02 mu g/L up to 4000 mu g/L). Following this acute exposure, a subset of fish was transferred to clean water for a 7-day depuration phase. We hypothesized that a pulse exposure to fipronil during critical periods of central nervous system development would adversely affect fish later in life. After a 48 hour pulse exposure, survival was reduced in embryos exposed to 2 mu g fipronil/L or greater. However, there was no further mortality during the depuration phase, nor were there changes in body length nor notochord length in larvae 9 dpf (days post-fertilization) compared to controls. Additional experiments were carried out at higher concentrations over 96 h (up to 4 dpf) to also elucidate developmental effects and teratogenicity of fipronil (43.7 mu g/L up to 4370 mu g/L). Fipronil at these higher concentrations significantly impacted the development of zebrafish, and the following morphometric and teratogenic effects were observed in 4 dpf fish; reduced body length, yolk sac and pericardial edema, reduced midbrain length, reduced optic and otic diameter, and truncation of the lower jaw. In depurated fish, we hypothesized that there would exist residual effects of exposure at the molecular level. Transcriptome profiling was therefore conducted on 9 dpf depurated larvae exposed initially for 48 h to one dose of either 0.2 mu g/L, 200 mu g/L or 2000 mu g/L fipronil. The expression of gene networks associated with glycogen and omega-3-fatty acid metabolism were decreased in larvae exposed to each of the three concentrations of fipronil, suggesting metabolic disruption. Moreover, transcriptomics revealed that fipronil suppressed gene networks related to light-dark adaptation, photoperiod sensing, and circadian rhythm. Based on these data, we tested fish for altered behavioral responses in a Light-Dark preference test. Larvae exposed to > 200 mu g fipronil/L as embryos showed fewer number of visits (20-30% less) to the dark zone compared to controls. Larvae also spent a lower amount of time in the dark zone compared to controls, suggesting that fipronil strengthened dark avoidance behavior which is indicative of anxiety. This study demonstrates that a short pulse exposure to fipronil can affect transcriptome networks for metabolism, circadian rhythm, and response to light in fish after depuration, and these molecular responses are hypothesized to be related to aberrant behavioral effects observed in the light-dark preference test.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of organophosphate pesticides could reduce the ability of fish to escape predation under low doses of exposure
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Biomarkers are frequently used in ecotoxicology as they allow to study toxicant effects happening at low concentrations of exposure. However, most sublethal studies only evaluate cellular biomarkers which lack evident ecological relevance. We used a multibiomarker approach to estimate the toxic effects of ethoprophos, an organophosphate insecticide commonly used in banana plantations, on the tropical fish Astyanax aeneus (Characidae). We measured biomarkers at sub-individual (cellular) and individual (metabolism, behavior) levels and examined relationships among these responses. A sublethal exposure to ethoprophos caused a significant (54%) reduction of brain Cholinesterase (ChE) activity, reflecting the pesticide's high neurotoxicity. However, other biomarkers like oxidative stress, biotransformation reactions, and resting metabolic rate were not affected. Exposure to ethoprophos modified antipredator behaviors such as escape response and detection avoidance (light/dark preference): exposed fish escaped slower from a simulated attack and preferred brighter areas in a novel tank. The relationship between ChE activity and reaction time suggests that pesticide-induced ChE inhibition reduces escape ability in fish. Our results provide evidence that impacts of organophosphate pesticides on fish ecological fitness can occur even with short exposures at very low concentrations.

TI  - Diuron and diazinon alter the behavior of zebrafish embryos and larvae in the absence of acute toxicity
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The use of zebrafish for aquatic vertebrate (eco)toxicity testing allows the assessment of effects on a wide range of biological levels - from enzymes to sensory organs and.behavioral endpoints. The present study investigated the effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron regarding the acute toxicity and behavior of zebrafish embryos and larvae. After conducting the fish embryo toxicity test, three concentrations (1, 2 and 3.5 mg L-1 for diazinon and 1, 2 and 3.8 mg L-1 for diuron) were evaluated for effects on embryonic spontaneous movement and heartbeat, larval light -dark transition response, and thigmotaxis. Although the modes -of -action are different, both pesticides proved to be moderately toxic to early life stages of zebrafish with 96 h LC50 of approximately 6.5 mg L-1 and similar EC50 values of approximately 4 mg L-1. Changes in behavioral endpoints were detected 24 h of exposure, suggesting that behavioral measurements can serve as sensitive and early indicators of pesticide exposure. Changes in behavior, such as decrease in spontaneous coiling movements of embryos and reduction of thigmotaxis in larvae, were pronounced for diuron, indicating the usefulness of the application of behavioral endpoints to assess the effects of other herbicides. In the case of diazinon, the effects were less prominent, but the detected changes in ratios between activity in light and darkness also point to the possibility of using behavioral changes for evaluation of insecticide effects. The obtained results support the usage of behavioral endpoints in zebrafish embryos and larvae for the detection of early effects of pesticides. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effects of tebuconazole on morphology and exploratory larvae behavior and adult locomotion. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of this fungicide on AChE activity and gene expression in zebrafish larvae and in the adult zebrafish brain. Tebuconazole (4 mg/L) increased the ocular distance in larvae and reduced the distance travelled, absolute turn angle, line crossing and time outside area in exposed larvae. Moreover, adult zebrafish that were exposed to this fungicide (4 and 6 mg/L) showed a decrease in distance travelled and mean speed when compared to the control group. However, tebuconazole did not alter the number of line crossings or time spent in the upper zone. Tebuconazole inhibited AChE activity at concentrations of 4 mg/L for larvae and 4 and 6 mg/L in the adult zebrafish brain. However, this fungicide did not alter AChE gene expression in the adult zebrafish brain but increased AChE mRNA transcript levels in larvae. These findings demonstrated that tebuconazole could modulate the cholinergic system by altering AChE activity and that this change may be associated with the reduced locomotion of these animals.

TI  - The pyrethroid esfenvalerate induces hypoactivity and decreases dopamine transporter expression in embryonic/larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Esfenvalerate is a pyrethroid insecticide used widely for agricultural and residential applications. This insecticide has been detected in aquatic environments at concentrations that can induce sub-lethal effects in organisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were used to examine the effects of environmentally-relevant concentrations of esfenvalerate on development and behavior. It was hypothesized that esfenvalerate exposure would impair locomotion due to its effects on the central nervous system. We also measured mitochondrial bioenergetics and the expression of genes (dopamine system) as putative mechanisms of locomotor impairment. Concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mu g/L esfenvalerate did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in zebrafish, but there was an acceleration in hatching time for zebrafish exposed to 2 mu g/L esfenvalerate. As an indicator of neurotoxicity, the Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was conducted with 5, 6, and 7 dpf zebrafish after continuous exposure, and higher concentrations were used (4 and 8 mu g/L esfenvalerate) to better discern age-and dose dependent responses in behavior. Experiments revealed that, unlike the other stages, 6 dpf larvae showed evidence for hypo-activity with esfenvalerate, suggesting that different stages of larval development may show increased sensitivity to pyrethroid exposure. This may be related to age-dependent maturation of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that reduced larval activity may be associated with impaired production of ATP and the function of mitochondria at earlier life stages, however dramatic alterations in oxidative phosphorylation were not observed. Based on evidence that dopamine regulates behavior and studies showing that other pyrethroids affect dopamine system, we measured transcripts involved in dopaminergic signaling. We found that dopamine active transporter was down-regulated with 0.2 mu g/L esfenvalerate. Lastly, we comprehensively summarize the current literature (>20 studies) regarding the toxicity of pyrethroids in zebrafish, which is a valuable resource to those studying these pesticides. This study demonstrates that esfenvalerate at environmentally-relevant levels induces hypoactivity that are dependent upon the age of the zebrafish, and these behavioral changes are hypothesized to be related to impaired dopamine signaling.

TI  - Pyriproxyfen Exposure Impairs Cognitive Parameters and Alters Cortisol Levels in Zebrafish
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Pyriproxyfen is one of the most used larvicides and insecticides; it acts as an analog of juvenile insect hormone (a growth regulator). It is highly toxic during all stages of mosquito development, suppresses metamorphosis, and interferes in insect reproduction and proliferation. Pyriproxyfen and its main metabolite have been shown to affect brain development in rodents. This compound is employed mainly to eliminate outbreaks of the genusAedes, even in potable water. Despite the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen (Pestanal(R)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However, there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to control or vehicle. However,grandcrfgene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups. Taken together, these findings indicate that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive impairment and altered cortisol levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.

TI  - Zebrafish Larvae Rapidly Recover from Locomotor Effects and Neuromuscular Alterations Induced by Cholinergic Insecticides
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Owing to the importance of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, many insecticides target the cholinergic system Across phyla, cholinergic signaling is essential for many neuro-developmental processes including axonal pathfinding and synaptogenesis. Consequently, early-life exposure to such insecticides can disturb these processes, resulting in an impaired nervous system. One test frequently used to assess developmental neurotoxicity is the zebrafish light-dark transition test, which measures larval locomotion as a response to light changes. However, it is only poorly understood which structural alterations cause insecticide-induced locomotion defects and how persistent these alterations are. Therefore, this study aimed to link locomotion defects with effects on neuromuscular structures, including motorneurons, synapses, and muscles, and to investigate the longevity of the effects. The cholinergic insecticides diazinon and dimethoate (organophosphates), methomyl and pirimicarb (carbamates), and imidacloprid and thiacloprid (neonicotinoids) were used to induce hypoactivity. Our analyses revealed that some insecticides did not alter any of the structures assessed, while others affected axon branching (methomyl, imidacloprid) or muscle integrity (methomyl, thiacloprid). The majority of effects, even structural, were reversible within 24 to 72 h. Overall, we find that both neurodevelopmental and non-neurodevelopmental effects of different longevity can account for the reduced locomotion. These findings provide unprecedented insights into the underpinnings of insecticide-induced hypoactivity.

TI  - Investigation on the interaction of pyrethroid pesticides to estrogen receptor alpha through computational and experimental methods
T2  - COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB  - Pyrethroid insecticides are a group of widely used bio-mimetic synthetic pesticides. However, recent studies reported that they could have an accumulation effect in human which may cause series of health problems. Estrogen receptors (ER) are a class of nuclear receptors that are vital in proper physiological behavior of estrogens. To investigate the reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids, homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were conducted to explore the interaction between pyrethroids and ER alpha from atomic scale. The human ER alpha (2YJA) was selected as a template protein for homology modeling. Then eight typical pyrethroids and positive control estradiol were docked to the modeled protein. The highest scoring bifenthrin and the lowest scoring permethrin were chosen for in-depth analysis. MDs showed that the complex formed by permethrin with ER alpha had a lower RMSD value and binding free energies compared to bifenthrin. Based on these results from microscopic dimension, exposure experiments were implemented to validate the primary conclusions. VTG concentrations in male zebrafish's blood were significantly higher under permethrin exposure than bifenthrin, suggesting a stronger estrogenic activity and binding propensity. In this regard, the structural characteristics of molecules were analyzed, expecting to provide theoretical references for subsequent drug design and rational drug application.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of fipronil affects sensory and motor systems in zebrafish
T2  - PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that may selectively inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in insects. Although fipronil is the most widely used insecticide in aquatic environments, few studies have evaluated its neurotoxicity for the sensory and motor systems of aquatic vertebrates. We assessed the effects of acute fipronil exposure on the survival rate, number of hair cells of lateral lines, and neurotoxicity for zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, heat maps and the speed and distance of the swimming trajectory were compared between zebrafish subjected to the sham and fipronil treatments. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted separately to compare expressions of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurotoxicity related proteins in the brain tissue between adult zebrafish with sham and fipronil treatments. Our results indicated that the survival rates and the speed and distance of the swimming trajectory significantly decreased for adult zebrafish exposed to fipronil. The results also suggested that the number of hair cells of lateral lines significantly reduced for zebrafish embryos exposed to fipronil. In histopathology and Western blotting tests, substantial oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were observed in the brain tissue of adult zebrafish exposed to fipronil. Our results revealed that fipronil toxicity may impair sensory and motor systems in zebrafish because of damage to lateral hair cells and brain tissue through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, which in turn result in a significantly reduced survival rate and impaired locomotion. The behavioral responses of zebrafish exposed to fipronil toxicity should be determined for better understanding the reliability of behavioral biomarkers in the risk assessment of environmental toxicology.

TI  - MONITORING BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES OF ZEBRAFISH (Danio rerio) AS A BIOMARKER FOR IDENTIFYING CADMIUM AND DELTAMETHRIN IN WATER
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This study investigated the different behavioral responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) under sudden stress from two types of chemicals (heavy metals and insecticides) and explored the correlations of behavioral responses and several well-known biomarkers. Adult zebrafish were exposed to cadmium (Cd) and deltamethrin for 5 hours. An increase in avoidance speed and turning frequency was first detected behavioral response. The duration of hyperactivity was almost 50 min in the deltamethrin exposure test and only 15 min in the Cd exposure test. A positive linear correlation was detected between variation in speed and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in deltamethrin exposure (p<0.01, r(2)=0.7103), while no correlation was detected for Cd exposure (p>0.05, r(2)=0.0646). After 20 min exposure, zebrafish exposed to Cd stayed near the bottom but surfaced more frequently to deltamethrin. Swimming depth increased by 61.98% from 139.92 mm to 226.24 mm in deltamethrin exposure, but decreased by 92.16% from 161.26 mm to 83.92 mm in Cd exposure. Our results suggest that those type-specific characters may attribute to the different mode of action of chemicals studied. The increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level and glutathione (GSH) concentration in tissues showed that toxicity was mainly in the gill following deltamethrin exposure but in the liver following Cd exposure. Speed and turning frequency under both exposures decreased significantly, even lower than the control group, which indicated a possible energy reallocation from locomotion to detoxification processes. Behavioral toxicity classifications provide another tool that may be used to help separate chemicals according to mode of action, which can contribute to the development of a biological early warning system for detecting toxicants at early stages of pollution.

TI  - Acute exposure of embryo, larvae and adults of Danio rerio to fipronil commercial formulation reveals effects on development and motor control
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The insecticide fipronil, one of the main pesticides used in Brazil, is often detected in natural aquatic environments, and causes neuronal hyperexcitation by inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to putative alterations in behaviour and development. This work sought to analyse the toxicity of formulated Regent(R) 800WG (80% fipronil) on development (fish embryo toxicity test, FET), morphology, and swimming behaviour of larvae and adults of zebrafish (Danio rerio). FET was performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 1600 mu g.L-1 of formulated Regent(R) 800WG. Adults were exposed to 0.2, 2 and 20 mu g.L-1 of the product for 24 and 96 h, and were submitted to the light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance tests No lethal parameters were observed in larvae, but in concentrations above 400 mu g.L-1, there was shortening of the body axis and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.

TI  - Evaluation of acute and developmental effects of difenoconazole via multiple stage zebrafish assays
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - zebrafish, during embryo, larvae and adult stages were selected to investigate the potential environmental risk and aquatic toxicity of a widely used fungicide, difenoconazole. In addition to mortality, embryo development endpoints, teratogenic effects and behavior abnormity were measured. Finally, the developmental parameters of the adult fish were assessed after 14 days' exposure. This study concluded that the acute toxicity of difenoconazole to the three phases of zebrafish were larvae (1.17 mg/L) > adult fish (1.45 mg/L) > embryo (2.34 mg/L). A large suite of symptoms was induced in embryonic development by different dosages of difenoconazole, including hatching inhibition, abnormal spontaneous movement, slow heart rate, growth regression and morphological deformities. 0.50 mg/L of difenoconazole could cause significant body color blackening and decrease in the heart rate of zebrafish larvae over 24 h. In addition, 025 mg/L of difenoconazole apparently inhibited the growth weight of adult zebrafish measured after 14 days' exposure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - EFFECTS OF beta-ENDOSULFAN ON THE GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION OF ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Because of persistent organic pollution in aquatic environments, the widely used organochlorine pesticide endosulfan, which is a potential endocrine disruptor, is expected to pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms. In the present study, we explored the potential endocrine-disrupting risk of beta-endosulfan by investigating its effect on the growth, reproduction, plasma vitellogenin, and organ histology of adult zebrafish. We found that, although beta-endosulfan did not significantly affect the growth of zebrafish, it greatly decreased the hatching rate, even at a concentration as low as 10 ng/L. Interestingly, the decrease of the hatching rate was highly correlated with pathological alterations of the testes. Additionally, the values of the gonadosomatic index were significantly reduced in female zebrafish treated with 200 ng/L beta-endosulfan, which was also closely associated with ovarian histological changes. More importantly, a significant increase in the level of vitellogenin was observed in all male fish treated with beta-endosulfan. Based on these findings, we conclude that beta-endosulfan severely affects the reproductive function of zebrafish and the synthesis of vitellogenin in the liver, and thus, beta-endosulfan has a serious endocrine disruption function in zebrafish.

TI  - Chiral bioaccumulation behavior of tebuconazole in the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Tebuconazole is an effective chiral fungicide, and previous studies have demonstrated that tebuconazole enantiomers exhibit enantioselective toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the chiral bioaccumulation behavior of tebuconazole in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Two exposure concentrations (0.107 and 1.07 mg/L) of tebuconazole were used. The uptake experiments lasted for 8 days, and subsequently, the zebrafish were transferred to another clean tank containing water without tebuconazole for depuration experiments (up to 14 days). A significant trend in enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed in these zebrafish with the preferential accumulation of ( -)-R-tebuconazole at two dose levels. The results of the depuration experiments indicated that the degradation of)-R-tebuconazole in zebrafish was slower than that of (+)-S-tebuconazole. The BCFk values for (+)-S-tebuconazole and ()-R-tebuconazole in a low dose of this chemical were 11.22 and 16.25, respectively, while at a high dose, these values were 9.79 and 10.31, respectively. The enantiomer fraction of tebuconazole in zebrafish and water ranged from 031-0.49. Hence, future research should focus on the fate of tebuconazole in the aquatic environment at the enantiomer levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Chiral Triazole Fungicide Difenoconazole: Absolute Stereochemistry, Stereoselective Bioactivity, Aquatic Toxicity, and Environmental Behavior in Vegetables and Soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - In this study, the systemic assessments of the stereoisomers of triazole fungicide difenoconazole are reported for the first time, including absolute stereochemistry, stereoselective bioactivity toward pathogens (Alternaria sonali, Fulvia fulva, Botrytis cinerea, and Rhizoctonia solani), and toxicity toward aquatic organisms (Scenedesmus obliquus, Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio). Moreover, the stereoselective degradation of difenoconazole in vegetables (cucumber, Cucumis sativus and tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum) under field conditions and in soil under laboratory-controlled conditions (aerobic and anaerobic) was investigated. There were 1.33-24.2-fold and 1.04-6.78-fold differences in bioactivity and toxicity, respectively. Investigations on the stereoselective degradation of difenoconazole in vegetables showed that the highest-toxic and lowest-bioactive (2S,4S)-stereoisomer displays a different enrichment behavior in different plant species. Under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, (2R,4R)- and (2R,4S)-difenoconazole were preferentially degraded in the soil. Moreover, difenoconazole was configurationally stable in the test soil matrices. On the basis of biological activity, ecotoxicity, and environmental behavior, it is likely that the use of pure (2R,4S)-difenoconazole instead of the commercial stereoisomer mix may help to increase the bioactivity and reduce environmental pollution.

TI  - Impairment of trophic interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) by chlorpyrifos
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The effects of chemicals on biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, have rarely been investigated in aquatic ecotoxicology. This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.

TI  - Endosulfan exposure inhibits brain AChE activity and impairs swimming performance in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Endosulfan is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide that is still widely in use in many developing countries. Following application, endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L group presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 +/- 1.038 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1): p = 0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 +/- 1.768 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p = 0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (approximate to 21%, 273.7 +/- 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 +/- 21.30, p = 0.0483), traveled distance (approximate to 20%, 23.44 +/- 2.127 m compared to the control group 29.39 +/- 1.585, p = 0.0281), mean speed (approximate to 25%, 0.03 +/- 0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04 +/- 0.002, p = 0.0275) and body turn angle (approximate to 21%, 69.940 +/- 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88.010 +/- 4560, p = 0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - NMR-based Metabolomic Responses of Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) by Fipronil Exposure
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MAGNETIC RESONANCE SOCIETY
AB  - Fipronil, the phenylpyrazole insecticide, is effective and used in various fields. Especially, fipronil was reliable because it was known to be specific on invertebrate animals than vertebrate animals including mammals. However, fipronil had potential risks that affect vertebrate animals as it blocks the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors that also exists in vertebrates as well as invertebrates. Therefore, it was necessary that harmful effects of fipronil on vertebrates are clarified. For this purpose, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used on behalf of vertebrate animals in present study. The zebrafish were exposed to 5 mu/L, 25 mu/L, and 50 mu/L of fipronil during 12, 24 and 72 hours. To closely observe toxic process, 12 hours and 24 hours of additional time point were set in the exposure test. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics is an approach to detect metabolic changes in organism resulted from external stimuli. In this study, NMR-based metabolomics showed the metabolic changes in zebrafish caused by fipronil exposure. Metabolic analysis revealed that fipronil interfered with energy metabolism and decreased the antioxidant ability in zebrafish. Antioxidant ability decline was remarkable at high exposure concentration. In addition, metabolic analysis results over time suggested that reactions for alleviating the excessive nerve excitation occurred in zebrafish after fipronil exposure. Through this study, it was elucidated that the adverse effects of fipronil on vertebrate animals are evident. The risk of fipronil on vertebrates can be no longer ignored. Moreover, this study has a meaning of practically necessary research for organism by examining the effects of fipronil at low concentrations existed in real environment.

TI  - Dysregulation of circadian rhythm in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by thifluzamide: Involvement of positive and negative regulators
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Thifluzamide as a fungicide is toxic to brain of zebrafish embryos. Brain can regulate biological rhythms. To clarify whether thifluzamide would influence circadian rhythms, zebrafish embryos were treated with thifluzamide (0, 0.19, 1.90 and 2.85 mg/L) for 4 days. Exposure to thifluzamide induced pronounced changes in embryo brain and melatonin levels. The mRNA levels of genes related to circadian rhythms were apparently altered. Among these, the transcripts of cry1ba and clock1 were extremely correlated with exposure concentrations. Importantly, the content of cry1 showed no apparent changes, but the clock level was dramatically increased. Moreover, consistent with the inhibition of development and behavior, the levels of GH and DA were significantly inhibited. In addition, the expression levels of genes related to development, behavior and reproduction were significantly changed by thifluzamide. Therefore, we speculated that circadian disruption due to thifluzamide exposure were primarily attributed to increases in expression of clock1a and contents of clock, which might be at least in part responsible for abnormal development and behavior of zebrafish. In addition, our research will provide important insights into the grouped assessment of SDHI pesticides in future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline and diazinon on different biological organisation levels of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - In this study the effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA), a decomposition product of the herbicides propanil and diuron (and other pesticides), and diazinon, a neurotoxic insecticide, on early life stages of zebrafish Danio rerio were assessed. The toxicity of these substances with different modes of action (acetylcholine esterase inhibitor vs. polar narcosis) was tested for single substances as well as in binary mixtures. To study effects on different biological organisation levels (from the molecular up to the whole organism level) the molecular stress response regarding Hsp70, the embryonic and larval development and the locomotor activity were investigated as integrative biomarkers. In single substance tests 3,4-dichloroaniline elicited deformations at a parts per thousand yen0.25 mg/l during the 11 days subchronic test, whereas locomotor activity and mortality were impaired at a parts per thousand yen0.5 mg/l. Diazinon effects on those parameters were obvious at a parts per thousand yen2 mg/l, except for the deformation rate (11 days:1 mg/l). In equitoxic mixtures of both substances concentration additivity was observed for deformation rate and mortality (11 days). An increase in the Hsp70 content occurred in zebrafish exposed to 0.25 mg 3,4-DCA/l as well as to 0.05 mg diazinon/l; in mixtures concentration additivity could be shown. The investigated endpoints varied in respect to their sensitivity, with deformations and Hsp70 levels as most sensitive parameters concerning 3,4-DCA and Hsp70 as most sensitive parameter concerning diazinon. Accordingly, for an integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals and their mixtures on fish, a battery of different test methods should be applied.

TI  - Comparative analyses of the neurobehavioral, molecular, and enzymatic effects of organophosphates on embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Organophosphates insecticides (OPs) are common surface water contaminants in both urban and agricultural landscapes. Neurobehavioral effects on larval fish are known to occur at concentrations higher than those reported in the environment. The aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of neurobehavioral, molecular, and biochemical responses of four OPs (diazinon, dichlorvos, malathion, methyl-parathion) via the following endpoint measurements: distance traveled, velocity, gene expression (AChE, c-Fos, LINGO-1B, GRIN-1B), enzymatic acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and carboxylesterase (CES) activity. OP exposures (5 hpf - 120 dpf) on embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) were assessed using a larval zebrafish behavior assay at concentrations: 0.01, 0.1, 10, and 100 mu g/L. Individual OPs had varying degrees of neurotoxicity. Significant hypoactivity was observed in the 100 mu g/L treatments for diazinon and malathion (p < 0.05) as compared to the controls. Diazinon-exposed larvae exhibited a 26% locomotor decrease, and hypoactivity was observed in malathion-exposed larvae at a reduction of 22% and 29% for distance traveled and velocity, respectively. Gene regulation and enzymatic activity changes were measured for both 0.1 and 100 mu g/L exposures across OP treatments. Increased CES activity was observed for the 0.1 mu g/L treatments of diazinon and methyl-parathion as well as the 100 mu g/L treatment of dichlorvos; meanwhile, decreased CES activity was observed for 100 mu g/L treatments of diazinon and malathion. Relative enzymatic activity of AChE was inhibited as compared to the control for the 0.1 mu g/L diazinon. No other treatment group exhibited a significant effect on biochemical AChE activity; however, AChE upregulation was observed in the 0.1 mu g/L exposure for diazinon, dichlorvos, and malathion. Methyl-parathion was observed to downregulate c-Fos at 0.1 mu g/L exposure. Malathion upregulated LINGO-1B at 100 mu g/L, a gene associated with neuronal regeneration; meanwhile, downregulation of LINGO-1B was observed for 0.1 mu g/L exposure of methyl-parathion. Additional downregulation was observed for GRIN-1B in the 100 mu g/L diazinon, 100 mu g/L dichlorvos, and 0.1 mu g/L methyl-parathion treatments. Exposure of ZF embryos to independent concentrations of 100 mu g/L concentrations of diazinon and malathion resulted in hypoactivity and decreased CES activity at 5 dfp. No changes in swimming behavior were observed for either the 0.1 mu g/L or 100 mu g/L dichlorvos or methyl-parathion treatments. Observations from this study indicate that AChE inhibition may not be the most sensitive biomarker of OP pesticide exposure in zebrafish. Rather, the enzyme CES demonstrated higher sensitivity as a biomarker of OP toxicity.

TI  - Zebrafish seizure model identifies p,p -DDE as the dominant contaminant of fetal California sea lions that accounts for synergistic activity with domoic acid.
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal poisoning of California sea lions (CSLs; Zalophus californianus) has been associated with exposure to the algal toxin domoic acid. These same sea lions accumulate a mixture of persistent environmental contaminants including pesticides and industrial products such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Developmental exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its stable metabolite 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p -DDE) has been shown to enhance domoic acid-induced seizures in zebrafish; however, the contribution of other co-occurring contaminants is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We formulated a mixture of contaminants to include PCBs, PBDEs, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and chlordane at levels matching those reported for fetal CSL blubber to determine the impact of co-occurring persistent contaminants with p,p -DDE on chemically induced seizures in zebrafish as a model for the CSLs. METHODS: Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to p,p -DDE in the presence or absence of a defined contaminant mixture prior to neurodevelopment via either bath exposure or embryo yolk sac microinjection. After brain maturation (7 days postfertilization), fish were exposed to a chemical convulsant, either pentylenetetrazole or domoic acid; resulting seizure behavior was then monitored and analyzed for changes, using cameras and behavioral tracking software. RESULTS: Induced seizure behavior did not differ significantly between subjects with embryonic exposure to a contaminant mixture and those exposed to p,p -DDE only. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that p,p -DDE–in the absence of PCBs, HCH, chlordane, and PBDEs that co-occur in fetal sea lions–accounts for the synergistic activity that leads to greater sensitivity to domoic acid seizures.

TI  - Protective Effects of Spermidine and Melatonin on Deltamethrin-Induced Cardiotoxicity and Neurotoxicity in Zebrafish
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Increased application of the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin has adverse effects on the cardiac system and neurobehavior on the non-target organisms, which has raised the public's attention. Because of spermidine and melatonin considered to have cardioprotective and neuroprotective characteristics, zebrafish were utilized as the model organism to explore the protective effects of spermidine and melatonin against deltamethrin-induced toxicity. We tested the neurobehavior of zebrafish larvae through a rest/wake behavior assay, and evaluated the levels of the expression of Scn5lab, gata4, nkx2.5, hcrt, hcrtr, and aanat2 by qRT-PCR. Besides that cmlc2 was evaluated by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Results have shown that compared with control group, 0.025 mg/L deltamethrin could significantly disturb the cardiac development, downregulating the expression of Scn5lab and transcriptional factors gata4 and nkx2.5, disturbing cardiac looping, resulting in defects in cardiac morphology and function. Moreover, deltamethrin could alter the expression levels of rest/wake genes and cause hyperactivity in zebrafish larvae. Besides, compared with deltamethrin group, the exogenous 0.01 mg/L spermidine and 0.232 mg/L melatonin could significantly rescue the adverse effects of deltamethrin on the cardiac system and neurobehavior in zebrafish. This indicated that spermidine and melatonin have neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects against deltamethrin-induced adverse effects in zebrafish.

TI  - Microplastics reduce the bioaccumulation and oxidative stress damage of triazole fungicides in fish
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) and pesticides are typical representatives of harmful chemicals in polluted waters. It is understood that the combined toxicity may differ from that of a single toxic substance. Although their combined toxicities on aquatic organisms have practical significance and research value, they have received little attention due to their complicated interaction, and the mechanism has rarely been reported. In this paper, we designed a study to investigate the single and combined effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) and the triazole fungicide difenoconazole on zebrafish, and to explore the mechanism of this effect. The results showed that PS-MPs could reduce the bioaccumulation of difenoconazole in zebrafish to a certain extent and alleviate the oxidative stress damage of difenoconazole in the zebrafish liver. The transcriptome and qRT-PCR data revealed the association of multiple pathways in the difenoconazole response, while the presence of PS-MPs ameliorated this effect in gene expression changes. Due to the properties of PS-MPs and the interaction between them, the toxic effect of difenoconazole when combined with PS-MPs is more prominent. These results provide a novel aspect to understand the environmental behavior of MPs and to evaluate the combined effect of MPs and pesticides on aquatic food. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multi- and transgenerational effects following early-life exposure of zebrafish to permethrin and coumarin 47: Impact on growth, fertility, behavior and lipid metabolism
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Transgenerational effects induced by environmental stressors are a threat to ecosystems and human health. However, there is still limited observation and understanding of the potential of chemicals to influence life outcomes over several generations. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two environmental contaminants, coumarin 47 and permethrin, on exposed zebrafish (FO) and their progeny (F1-F3). Coumarin 47 is commonly found in personal care products and dyes, whereas permethrin is used as a domestic and agricultural pyrethroid insecticide/insect repellent. Zebrafish (F0) were exposed during early development until 28 days post-fertilization and their progeny (F1-F3) were bred unexposed. On one hand, the effects induced by coumarin 47 suggest no multigenerational toxicity. On the other hand, we found that behavior of zebrafish larvae was significantly affected by exposure to permethrin in F1 to F3 generations with some differences depending on the concentration. This suggests persistent alteration of the neural or neuromuscular function. In addition, lipidomic analyses showed that permethrin treatment was partially correlated with lysophosphatidylcholine levels in zebrafish, an important lipid for neurodevelopment. Overall, these results stress out one of the most widely used pyrethroids can trigger long-term, multi- and possibly transgenerational changes in the nervous system of zebrafish. These neurobehavioral changes echo the effects observed under direct exposure to high concentrations of permethrin and therefore call for more research on mechanisms underlying effect inheritance.

TI  - Waterborne agrichemicals compromise the anti-predatory behavior of zebrafish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Due to human activities, there is an increasing presence of agrochemicals residues in water bodies, which could be attributed to an increased use of these chemicals, incorrect disposal of packaging materials, and crop leaching. The effects of these residues on prey-predator relationship of aquatic animals are poorly known. Here, we show that fish acutely exposed to glyphosate, 2,4-D, and methylbenzoate-based agrichemicals have their anti-predatory responses impaired. We exposed zebrafish to sub-lethal concentrations of agrichemicals and evaluated their behavioral reaction against a simulated bird predatory strike. We observed that agrichemical-exposed fish spent more time in a risky area, suggesting that the pesticides interfered with their ability of risk perception. Our results highlight the impairment and environmental consequences of agrochemical residues, which can affect aquatic life and crucial elements for life (food web) such as the prey-predator relationship.

TI  - Behavioral Responses in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Exposed to Heavy Metal and Insecticide Induced Stress
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Changes in fish behavior can help identify accidental chemical pollution. Heavy metals and pesticides are two of the most found pollutants to investigate the different behavioral responses of fish to these two types of pollutants exposure. Methods : Real-time computer imaging was utilized to record parameters of fish behaviors, including swimming speed, turning frequency, depth and distance between fish. Deltamethrin and cadmium were 0.015 ppm and 3.5 ppm, respectively. It was conducted for a total period of 180 min. Fish behaviors were recorded with dechlorinated water during the first 60 mins, then deltamethrin and cadmium was introduced to observe behavioral responses of zebrafish during the next 120 mins. Result: As a result of increased swimming activity, the first response of zebrafish is avoidance followed by a changed distribution in the test chamber. The duration of hyperactivity during deltamethrin exposure was lasted 35 minutes larger than Cd exposure and the average swimming depth showed totally different trends with increased from 140 mm to 226 mm during deltamethrin exposure but decreased from 161 to 84 mm during cadmium exposure. It is proved that these different responses do exist under in the two chemicals studied and this may contribute to the development of biological early warning system to separate accidental chemical pollution types.

TI  - Screening anti-predator behaviour in fish larvae exposed to environmental pollutants
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Predation is one of the main sources of mortality for fish larvae. During evolution, they have developed different anti-predator behaviours, as the vibrational-evoked startle response and its habituation, for promoting survival to predator's strikes. Whereas these two behaviours can be altered by the exposure to some neurotoxicants, it is currently unknown if the exposure to environmentally relevant concentration (ERC) of neurotoxic pollutants could impair them. In this study thirty neurotoxic environmental pollutants from nine chemical groups, including: herbicides: carbamate, organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides; toxins; metal and non-metal elements, have been screened at two concentrations, including one environmental relevant concentration (ERC), for adverse effects on anti-predator behaviours by using the Vibrational Startle Response Assay on zebrafish larvae. Significant effects over anti-predator responses were equally observed in both exposure concentrations. Focusing on the ERC scenario, it was found that the startle response was the less affected behaviour, where ten pollutants from all chemical groups except for organochlorine, neonicotinoid and pyrethroids, altered this response. Interestingly, organic and inorganic pollutants showed opposite effects on this response: whereas all organic pollutants decreased the startle response, the three remaining inorganic pollutants increased it. On the other hand, more pollutants affected habituation of the startle response of the larvae, where thirteen of the pollutants from all groups, except for herbicides, altered this behaviour at ERC, generally resulting in a faster habituation except for one OP and one marine toxin, which were able to delay this response. Ultimately, only one chemical from the OP, toxin, metal and non-metal element groups altered both the startle response and its habituation at both ERC and WSC. These results emphasize the environmental risk of the current levels of some neurotoxicants present in our aquatic ecosystems, as they are high enough to impair essential anti-predator behaviours in fish larvae.

TI  - Flutolanil affects circadian rhythm in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by disrupting the positive regulators
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Circadian rhythms are fundamental to behavior and physiology of organisms. Flutolanil as a fungicide is toxic to zebrafish embryos. The aims of this study were to determine whether fiutolanil would influence circadian rhythms of zebrafish and the mechanism involved. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to flutolanil (0, 0.125, 0.5 and 2 mg/L) for 4 days. Here we report that flutolanil increased the melatonin levels of zebrafish. The mRNA levels of genes related to circadian rhythms were significantly altered. The clock level was significantly increased, but the content of cry1 showed no apparent changes. Moreover, our findings that the level of GH was significantly decreased were consistent with the abnormal development of zebrafish embryos. The expression levels of genes related to development, behavior and reproduction were significantly altered by flutolanil. These results indicate that flutolanil disturbed circadian rhythms of zebrafish primarily by affecting the positive elements, which were at least in partial responsible for abnormal development and behavior of zebrafish. And we speculate that flutolanil is toxic to zebrafish embryos at least in part via dysregulation of circadian rhythms involving clock. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation caused by contaminants: Atrazine as a chemical barrier isolating fish populations
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Information on how atrazine can affect the spatial distribution of organisms is non-existent. As this effect has been observed for some other contaminants, we hypothesized that atrazine-containing leachates/discharges could trigger spatial avoidance by the fish Poecilia reticulata and form a chemical barrier isolating upstream and downstream populations. Firstly, guppies were exposed to an atrazine gradient in a non-forced exposure system, in which organisms moved freely among the concentrations, to assess their ability to avoid atrazine. Secondly, a chemical barrier formed by atrazine, separating two clean habitats (extremities of the non-forced system), was simulated to assess whether the presence of the contaminant could prevent guppies from migrating to the other side of the system. Fish were able to avoid atrazine contamination at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.02 mu g L-1), below those described to cause sub-lethal effects. The AC(50) (atrazine concentration causing avoidance to 50% of the population) was 0.065 mu g L-1. The chemical barrier formed by atrazine at 150 mu g L-1 (concentration that should produce an avoidance around 82%) caused a reduction in the migratory potential of the fish by 47%; while the chemical barrier at 1058 mu g L-1 (concentration that produces torpidity) caused a reduction in the migratory potential of the fish by 91%. Contamination by atrazine, besides driving the spatial distribution of fish populations, has potential to act as a chemical barrier by isolating fish populations. This study includes a novel approach to be integrated in environmental risk assessment schemes to assess high-tier contamination effects such as habitat fragmentation and population displacement and isolation.

TI  - Differential acetylcholinesterase inhibition of chlorpyrifos, diazinon and parathion in larval zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Zebrafish are increasingly used for developmental neurotoxicity testing because early embryonic events are easy to visualize, exposures are done without affecting the mother and the rapid development of zebrafish allows for high throughput testing. We used zebrafish to examine how exposures to three different organophosphorus pesticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon and parathion) over the first five days of embryonic and larval development of zebrafish affected their survival, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and behavior. We show that at non-lethal, equimolar concentrations, chlorpyrifos (CPF) is more effective at equimolar concentrations than diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) in producing AChE inhibition. As concentrations of DZN and PA are raised, lethality occurs before they can produce the degree of AChE inhibition observed with CPF at 300 nM. Because of its availability outside the mother at the time of fertilization, zebrafish provides a complementary model for studying the neurotoxicity of very early developmental exposures.

TI  - Exposure to permethrin or chlorpyrifos causes differential dose- and time-dependent behavioral effects at early larval stages of an endangered teleost species
T2  - ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH
AB  - Pyrethroid and organophosphate pesticides are two of the most commonly used classes of insecticide worldwide. At sublethal concentrations, permethrin (a pyrethroid) and chlorpyrifos (an organophosphate) impact behavior in model fish species. We investigated behavioral effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of permethrin or chlorpyrifos on early larval delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a Critically Endangered teleost species endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta, California, USA. Using a photomotor behavioral assay of oscillating light and dark periods, we measured distance moved, turn angle, meander, angular velocity, rotations, thigmotaxis (time spent in the border versus center), and swim speed duration and frequency. The lowest concentrations of permethrin used in the tests (0.05 and 0.5 mu g l(-1)) caused significant increases in distance moved at 72 and 96 h, respectively. At 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure, 5 mu g l(-1) of permethrin caused a hyperactive state in which the larvae significantly decreased thigmotaxis, quickly turning in short bouts of activity, characterized by significant increases in rotations and freezing events. Larvae exposed to 0.05 mu g l(-1) chlorpyrifos significantly increased thigmotaxis at 72 and 96 h. In response to 5 mu g l(-1) chlorpyrifos, larvae significantly increased velocity at 72 h exposure, and significantly increased freezing events at 96 h. Behavioral data on larval delta smelt exposed to contaminants present in their limited habitat have the potential to aid evaluations of the suitability of spawning and rearing habitats for this endangered species, thus improving conservation management strategies focused on this sensitive life stage.

TI  - Multiple Screening of Pesticides Toxicity in Zebrafish and Daphnia Based on Locomotor Activity Alterations
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
AB  - Pesticides are widely used to eradicate insects, weed species, and fungi in agriculture. The half-lives of some pesticides are relatively long and may have the dire potential to induce adverse effects when released into the soil, terrestrial and aquatic systems. To assess the potential adverse effects of pesticide pollution in the aquatic environment, zebrafish (Danio rerio) andDaphnia magnaare two excellent animal models because of their transparent bodies, relatively short development processes, and well-established genetic information. Moreover, they are also suitable for performing high-throughput toxicity assays. In this study, we used both zebrafish larvae and water flea daphnia neonates as a model system to explore and compare the potential toxicity by monitoring locomotor activity. Tested animals were exposed to 12 various types of pesticides (three fungicides and 9 insecticides) for 24 h and their corresponding locomotor activities, in terms of distance traveled, burst movement, and rotation were quantified. By adapting principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis, we were able to minimize data complexity and compare pesticide toxicity based on locomotor activity for zebrafish and daphnia. Results showed distinct locomotor activity alteration patterns between zebrafish and daphnia towards pesticide exposure. The majority of pesticides tested in this study induced locomotor hypo-activity in daphnia neonates but triggered locomotor hyper-activity in zebrafish larvae. According to our PCA and clustering results, the toxicity for 12 pesticides was grouped into two major groups based on all locomotor activity endpoints collected from both zebrafish and daphnia. In conclusion, all pesticides resulted in swimming alterations in both animal models by either producing hypo-activity, hyperactivity, or other changes in swimming patterns. In addition, zebrafish and daphnia displayed distinct sensitivity and response against different pesticides, and the combinational analysis approach by using a phenomic approach to combine data collected from zebrafish and daphnia provided better resolution for toxicological assessment.

TI  - Early detection of cyanide, organophosphate and rodenticide pollution based on locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Cyanide, organophosphate and rodenticides are highly toxic substances widely used in agriculture and industry. These toxicants are neuro-and organotoxic to mammals at low concentrations, thus early detection of these chemicals in the aqueous environment is of utmost importance. Here, we employed the behavioral toxicity test with wildtype zebrafish larvae to determine sublethal concentrations of the above mentioned common environmental pollutants. After optimizing the test with cyanide, nine rodenticides and an organophosphate were successfully tested. The compounds dose-dependently initially (0-60-min exposure) stimulated locomotor activity of larvae but induced toxicity and reduced swimming during 60-120-min exposure. IC50 values calculated based on swimming distance after 2-h exposure, were between 0.1 and 10 mg/L for both first-generation and second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. Three behavioral characteristics, including total distance travelled, sinuosity and burst count, were quantitatively analyzed and compared by hierarchical clustering of the effects measured by each three parameters. The toxicity results for all three behavioral endpoints were consistent, suggesting that the directly measured parameter of cumulative swimming distance could be used as a promising biomarker for the aquatic contamination. The optimized method herein showed the potential for utilization as part of a monitoring system and an ideal tool for the risk assessment of drinking water in the military and public safety.

TI  - New evidence for neurobehavioral toxicity of deltamethrin at environmentally relevant levels in zebrafish
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Deltamethrin, a widely used type II pyrethroid insecticide, was reported with neurotoxicity to aquatic organisms, such as fish. However, the effects and potential mechanisms on the central nervous system remain largely unknown, especially under environmental concentrations. Therefore, we exposed adult female zebrafish to environmentally relevant levels of deltamethrin (30,100, and 333 ng/L) for 21 days to assess neurobehavioral changes related to the central nervous system and explore the modes of action. Behavioral assays revealed significant increases in the swimming speeds, residence time near other fish and the shoaling cohesion in exposed fish. Transcriptomic results enriched the disrupted neural functions involving the glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses in the brain. The qRT-PCR confirmed the up regulation of the factors for promoting the glutamate release. The measurement of neurotransmitters showed significantly increased content of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. Taken together, deltamethrin exposure increased the glutamate level and promoted the release of such an excitatory neurotransmitter between the glutamatergic synapses in the brain, which eventually led to hyperactivity of social behaviors in adult zebrafish.

TI  - The insecticide permethrin induces transgenerational behavioral changes linked to transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The pyrethroid insecticide permethrin is widely used for agricultural and domestic purposes. Previous data indicated that it acts as a developmental neurotoxicant and can induce transgenerational effects in non target organisms. However, associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate permethrin-related transgenerational effects in the zebrafish model, and to identify possible molecular mechanisms underlying inheritance. Zebrafish (F 0) were exposed to permethrin during early life (2 h post-fertilization up to 28 days). The F1 and F2 offspring generations were obtained by pairing exposed F0 males and females, and were bred unexposed. Locomotor and anxiety behavior were investigated, together with transcriptomic and epigenomic (DNA methylation) changes in brains. Permethrin exposed F0 fish were hypoactive at adulthood, while males from the F1 and F2 generations showed a specific decrease in anxiety-like behavior. In F0, transcriptomic data showed enrichment in pathways related to glutamatergic synapse activity, which may partly underlie the behavioral effects. In F1 and F2 males, dysregulation of similar pathways was observed, including a subset of differentially methylated regions that were inherited from the F0 to the F2 generation and indicated stable dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling. Altogether, the present results provide novel evidence on the transgenerational neurotoxic effects of permethrin, as well as mechanistic insight: a transient exposure induces persistent transcriptional and DNA methylation changes that may translate into transgenerational alteration of glutamatergic signaling and, thus, into behavioral alterations.

TI  - Vitamin C Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Behavioral Abnormalities Triggered by Fipronil and Pyriproxyfen Insecticide Chronic Exposure on Zebrafish Juvenile
T2  - ANTIOXIDANTS
AB  - Chronic exposure to synthetic insecticides in the early life of a child can lead to a series of disorders. Several causes as parental age, maternal smoking, birth complications, and exposure to toxins such as insecticides on childhood can lead to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential protective role of vitamin C (Vit. C) from children's supplements after 14 days chronic exposure to insecticide mixture fipronil (Fip) + pyriproxyfen (Pyr) on juvenile zebrafish for swimming performances, social behavior and oxidative stress associated with ASD model. Juvenile (14-17 mm) wild-type AB zebrafish (Danio rerio) (45 days) were exposed to relevant concentrations: vit. C (25 mu g L-1), Fip (600 mu g L-1/1.372 mu M) + Pyr (600 mu g L-1/1.89 mu M), and [Fip (600 mu g L-1/1.372 mu M) + Pyr (600 mu g L-1 /1.89 mu M)] + vit. C (25 mu g L-1). Our results showed that insecticides can disturb the social behavior of zebrafish during 14 days of the administration, decreased the swimming performances, and elevated the oxidative stress biomarkers of SOD (superoxide dismutase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and MDA (malondialdehyde). The vitamin C supplement significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity of insecticide mixture and oxidative stress. This study provides possible in vivo evidence to show that vitamin C supplements could attenuate oxidative stress and brain damage of fipronil and pyriproxyfen insecticide chronic exposure on zebrafish juvenile.

TI  - Vitamin C Mitigates Oxidative Stress and Behavioral Impairments Induced by Deltamethrin and Lead Toxicity in Zebrafish
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Environmental contamination from toxic metals and pesticides is an issue of great concern due to their harmful effects to human health and the ecosystems. In this framework, we assessed the adverse effects when aquatic organisms are exposed to toxicants such as deltamethrin (DM) and lead (Pb), alone or in combination, using zebrafish as a model. Moreover, we likewise evaluated the possible protective effect of vitamin C (VC) supplementation against the combined acute toxic effects of the two toxicants. Juvenile zebrafish were exposed to DM (2 mu g L-1) and Pb (60 mu g L-1) alone and in combination with VC (100 mu g L-1) and responses were assessed by quantifying acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (MDA), some antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and GPx), three-dimension locomotion responses and changes of elements concentrations in the zebrafish body. Our results show that VC has mitigative effects against behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by a mixture of contaminants, demonstrating that it can be used as an effective antioxidant. Moreover, the observations in the study demonstrate zebrafish as a promising in vivo model for assessing the neuroprotective actions of bioactive compounds.

TI  - Can a mixture of agrochemicals (glyphosate, chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil) mask the perception of an individual chemical? A hidden trap underlying ecological risk
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - As aquatic environments associated with conventional agriculture are exposed to various pesticides, it is important to identify any possible interactions that modify their effects when in a mixture. We applied avoidance tests with Danio rerio, exposing juveniles to three relevant current use pesticides: chlorpyrifos (CPF), chlorothalonil (CTL) and glyphosate (Gly), individually and in binary mixtures (CPF-Gly and CTL-Gly). Our goal was to identify the potential of contaminants to trigger the avoidance response in fish and detect any changes to that response resulting from binary mixtures. Avoidance was assessed for three hours using an open gradient system with six levels of increasing concentrations. Fish avoided environmentally relevant concentrations of the three compounds. The avoidance of CPF [AC50 = 7.95 (3.3-36.3) mu g/L] and CTL [AC50 = 3.41 (1.2-41.6) mu g/L] was evident during the entire period of observation. In the case of Gly, the response changed throughout the experiment: initially (until 100 min) the fish tolerated higher concentrations of the herbicide [AC50 = 52.2 (12.1-2700) mu g/L] while during the later period (after 100 min) a clearer avoidance [1.5 (0.8-4.2) mu g/L] was observed. The avoidance recorded using CPF and CTL alone was attenuated by the presence of Gly. Applying an additive concentration model, Gly initially acted synergistically with the other two compounds, although this interaction was not observed during the later period. Avoidance gives us an idea of how the distribution of populations may be altered by contamination, our results suggest that in some mixtures this response may be inhibited, at least temporarily, thus masking the ecological risk of the exposure.

TI  - Short-term exposure to low doses of rotenone induces developmental, biochemical, behavioral, and histological changes in fish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Rotenone, a natural compound derived from plants of the genera Derris and Lonchocarpus, is used worldwide as a pesticide and piscicide. This study aims to assess short-term toxicity of rotenone to early-life stages of the fish Danio rerio and Poecilia reticulata using a wide and integrative range of biomarkers (developmental, biochemical, behavioral, and histopathological). Moreover, the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach was used to compare rotenone acute toxicity to fish species. Toxicity tests were based on the OECD protocols, fish embryo toxicity test (for D. rerio embryos), and fish acute toxicity test (for P. reticulata juveniles). D. rerio embryos were used to estimate lethal concentrations and analyze embryonic and enzymatic alterations (activity of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cholinesterase), while P. reticulata juveniles were used for the assessment of histological damage in the gills and liver. Rotenone induced significant mortality in zebrafish embryos with a 96-h lethal concentration 50 % (LC50) = 12.2 mu g/L. Rotenone was embryotoxic, affecting the development of D. rerio embryos, which showed cardiac edema; tail deformities; loss of equilibrium; and a general delay characterized by lack of tail detachment, delayed somite formation, yolk sac absorption, and lack of pigmentation. Biochemical biomarker inhibition was observed for concentrations >= 1 mu g/L for CAT and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and for cholinesterase (ChE) in concentration from 10 mu g/L. Behavioral changes were observed for P. reticulata juveniles exposed to concentrations equal to or above 25 mu g/L of rotenone; moreover, histological damage in the liver and gills of fish exposed to concentrations equal to or above 2.5 mu g/L could be observed. A hazard concentration 5 % (HC5) of 3.2 mu g/L was estimated considering the acute toxicity data for different fish species (n = 49). Lethal and sublethal effects of rotenone raise a concern about its effects on nontarget fish species, especially because rotenone and its metabolite rotenolone are frequently reported in the microgram range in natural environments for several days after field applications. Rotenone should be used with caution. Given the high toxicity and wide range of sublethal effects here reported, further studies in a chronic exposure scenario are recommended.

TI  - Exposure of low-dose fipronil enantioselectively induced anxiety-like behavior associated with DNA methylation changes in embryonic and larval zebrafish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Fipronil, a broad-spectrum chiral insecticide, has been documented to induce significant neurotoxicity to nontarget aquatic species; however, whether its neurotoxicity behaves enantioselectively and what molecular mechanisms correspond to the neurotoxicity remain unanswered. To date, few investigations have focused on the genomic mechanisms responsible for the enantioselective toxicity of chiral pesticides. The epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, caused by the pesticides are also blind spot of the research works. Video tracking showed that R-fipronil exhibited more intense neurotoxicity, as well as the induction of more severe anxiety-like behavior, such as boosted swimming speed and dysregulated photoperiodic locomotion, to embryonic and larval zebrafish compared with S-fipronil. The MeDIP-Seq analysis, combined with Gene Ontology and KEGG, revealed that R-fipronil disrupted five signaling pathways (MAPK, Calcium signaling, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Purine metabolism, and Endocytosis) to a greater extent than S-fipronil through the hypermethylation of several important neuro-related genes, whereas no significant alterations of global DNA methylation were observed on the two enantiomers. To summarize, our data indicated that the fipronil-conducted enantioselective neurotoxicity likely applied its enantioselectivity by the dysregulation of DNA methylation. Our study also provided novel epigenetic insights into the study of enantioselective biological effects and the relevant underlying mechanisms of chiral insecticide. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of cypermethrin induced behavioural and biochemical anomalies in adult zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Cypermethrin is one of the top five pesticides used globally. Although the effect of cypermethrin on the embryonic stages of zebrafish is well characterized, its toxic effect on the behaviour of adult zebrafish is largely unknown. Here we used videogram and automated tracking approach to quantitatively assess behavioural toxicity induced by the short exposure of cypermethrin to adult zebrafish. We observed that cypermethrin at 25ppb level induced behavioural toxicity in adult zebrafish. Motor activity of the treated group was significantly retarded which affected their overall exploratory behaviour including their visit to the central arena of the open-field test. Furthermore, the treated group showed erratic movements (covered less distance per unit time) without affecting their angle based behavioural endpoints. In contrast to the control group, the cypermethrin exposed group showed frequent freezing behaviour. However, their freezing episodes were characterized by constant drift-like movement caused by the loss of their voluntary control over the motor coordination. These behavioural changes are similar to typical anxiety-like behaviour. Though, cypermethrin exposure at ppb level for just half an hour was sufficient to induce behavioural toxicity, it failed to alter brain superoxide dismutase and acetylcholine esterase enzyme activity. Our data indicates that acute short-term exposure of cypermethrin induces behavioural anomalies in adult zebrafish through a mechanism distinct from alteration of brain superoxide dismutase and the acetylcholine esterase activity.

TI  - Avoidance response of Danio rerio to a fungicide in a linear contamination gradient
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The present study examines the ability of juvenile Danio rerio to avoid pyrimethanil-contaminated water. An avoidance assay system was used with a contamination gradient formed by seven compartments, through which the fish could move and choose the preferred compartment(s). Additionally, the influence of fish movements in promoting the mixing between compartments and thus disruption of the gradient over time was also examined by testing sodium chloride (NaCl) at sublethal concentrations. Samples with pyrimethanil were obtained from the commercial formulation Mythos (R), which was applied to mesocosm systems. Samples of the pyrimethanil-contaminated mesocosms water were collected and a series of seven concentrations (0.2 to 1.4 mg L-1 plus a control) diluted with reference (uncontaminated) mesocosm water were added to the system to form the gradient. After 4 h exposure, fish avoidance in the three highest pyrimethanil concentrations ranged from 29 to 66%. The 4 h-AC(50) (concentration at which 50% of the fish avoided pyrimethanil after 4 h exposure) was 1.10 (confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.12) mg L-1. However, the avoidance pattern after 12 h was strongly reduced and it was not possible to calculate the AC(50). This is explained by the results of the NaCl experiment, which showed that the movement of fish in the system accelerates the mixing of the solutions between compartments. As pyrimethanil can trigger avoidance response in D. rerio, this fungicide, even at non-lethal concentrations, could be considered an environmental disturber. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Waterborne Exposure of Paclobutrazol at Environmental Relevant Concentration Induce Locomotion Hyperactivity in Larvae and Anxiolytic Exploratory Behavior in Adult Zebrafish
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The available arable land is unable to fulfill the food production need of rapidly the exponentially growing human population in the world. Pesticides are one of those different measures taken to meet this demand. As a plant growth regulator to block gibberellin, paclobutrazol (PBZ) is used excessively throughout the world to promote early fruit setting, and to increase seed setting which might be harmful because PBZ is a very stable compound; therefore, it can bioaccumulate into the food chain of an ecosystem. In the present study, we discovered unexpected effects of PBZ on zebrafish larvae and adult behaviors by challenging them with low dose exposure. Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 mu g/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) and 1000 mu g/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days. After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior, while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.

TI  - A comprehensive review of 1,2,4-triazole fungicide toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio): A mitochondrial and metabolic perspective
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In this critical review, we synthesize data from peer-reviewed literature reporting on triazole fungicide exposures in the zebrafish model. Based on their mode of action in plants (potent inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis), we focused attention on mechanisms related to cellular, lipid, and steroid metabolism. Evidence from several studies reveals that zebrafish exposed to triazoles present with impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress, as well as dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Suchmetabolic disruptions are expected to underscore developmental delays, deformity, and aberrant locomotor activity and behaviors often observed following exposure. We begin by summarizing physiological and behavioral effects observed with triazole fungicide exposure in zebrafish. We then discuss mechanisms that may underlie adverse apical effects, focusing on mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism. Using computational approaches, we also identify novel biomarkers of triazole fungicide exposure. Extracting and analyzing data contained in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) revealed that transcriptional signatures responsive to different triazoles are related to metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, biological oxidations, and fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism among other processes. Pathway and sub-network analysis identified several transcripts that are responsive in organisms exposed to triazole fungicides, several of which include lipid-related genes. Knowledge gaps and recommendations for future investigations include; (1) targeted metabolomics for metabolites in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain; (2) additional studies conducted at environmentally relevant concentrations to characterize the potential for endocrine disruption, given that studies point to altered cholesterol (precursor for steroid hormones), as well as altered estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid hormone expression; (3) studies into the potential role for lipid peroxidation and oxidation of lipid biomolecules as a mechanism of triazole-induced toxicity, given the strong evidence for oxidative damage in zebrafish following exposure to triazole fungicides.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of fipronil in early development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae: Disrupted vascular formation with angiogenic failure and inhibited neurogenesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Fipronil has been widely used in agriculture to prevent aggressive insects from damaging agricultural products. Fipronil residues circulate in the environment and they have been detected in non-targeted organisms in aquatic environments. To study the effect of fipronil toxicity on environmental health, 6 h post fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were treated with fipronil for 72 h. LC50 value was obtained by applying varying concentrations of fipronil to zebrafish embryos for 72 h. As zebrafish embryos are useful vertebrate models for studying developmental and genetic findings in toxicology research, they were exposed to fipronil to study detailed elucidating mechanisms with hazardous end points of toxicity. Cell cycle arrest-related apoptosis supported pathological alterations, such as increased mortality, shortened body length, and reduced hatchability. Furthermore, observed heart defects, including edema and irregular heartbeat were caused due to abnormal blood circulation. In transgenic zebrafish models (fli1:eGFP and olig2:dsRED), disrupted blood vessel formations were indicated by eGFP(+) endothelial cells. Moreover, neurogenic defects were observed by studying dsRED(+) motor neurons and oligodendrocytes. This study demonstrates fipronil accumulation in aquatic environment and its ability to impair essential processes, such as angiogenesis and neurogenesis during early developmental stage of zebrafish, along with general developmental toxicity.

They were investigated important issues resulted during the chronic exposure with DM: effects on aggressive behavior and swimming performances knowing that is a high neurotoxic compound; toxicity on nervous system investigated on telencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum; activity of PCNA, p53 and TUNEL as toxicity markers in immunocytochemistry of the histological samples; changes of elements concentrations in the fish body and their role in detoxification of DM. This scenario investigated the harmful effects of this compound for freshwater fish communities. The aggressive behavior significantly increased and remained constant for the concentration 0.5 mu g L-1. They were not evidences in changing of anxiety level and swimming performances. The nervous system suffered significant damage for all studied concentrations and confirmed the changes in the behavior. Selenium concentration in the body decreased and may be involved in the detoxification processes.

TI  - Developmental exposure to organophosphate flame retardants causes behavioral effects in larval and adult zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Background: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have grown in usage since concerns about the health effects of the previously used polybrominated flame retardants led to their being phased out. The potential for OPFRs to cause adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Becaute of their structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. Methods: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03 or 03 mu M of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization. Vehicle control consisted of 0.03% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape. Results: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan. Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 mu M doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited significant (p < 0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate exposure significantly (p < 0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult fish, with fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. Discussion: Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader research investigating the role of organophosphate compounds, including the OPFRs used here, in developmental neurotoxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cardiovascular toxicity and anxiety-like behavior induced by deltamethrin in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Deltamethrin is widely used because of its low toxicity and high efficiency. Although its potential toxicity has been reported, its effects on cardiovascular system and motor behavior and its underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. In this study, the effects of deltamethrin on the development, cardiovascular system and motor behavior of zebrafish larvae and their possible mechanisms were evaluated using the transgenic zebrafish Tg (kdrl:mCherry) and Tg(myl7:GFP). At 72 hpf, the body length of larvae shortened, the head and eye area decreased, and the hatching rate increased. Acridine orange staining showed that treated zebrafish larvae produced different degrees of apoptosis in the head, body, heart and tail regions. Quantitative fluorescence intensity showed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis signal, indicating that deltamethrin could induce apoptosis. Confocal images and fluorescence intensity quantification of red fluorescent protein-labeled vascular endothelial cell and green fluorescent protein-labeled transgenic zebrafish more clearly reflected the dose-dependent cardiac and vascular morphology and the damage caused by deltamethrin. Deltamethrin significantly induced vascular endothelial growth factor flk1 and fli-1, cardiac development-related gene myl7 decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, deltamethrin increased the thigmotaxis of zebrafish larvae, causing anxiety-like behavior. Our study showed that deltamethrin could cause developmental toxicity, apoptosis, cardiovascular system damage and anxiety-like behavior, which provided a reference for the use of deltamethrin in agricultural production.

T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - In this study we explore the sub-lethal effects of two malaria vector control pesticides, deltamethrin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), on Xenopus laevis by incorporating different levels of biological organisation. Pesticide accumulation in frog tissue was measured alongside liver metabolomics and individual swimming behaviour to assess whether changes presented at these different levels, and if such changes could be linked between levels. Results showed evidence of concentration dependent accumulation of DDT and its metabolites, but no measurable accumulation of deltamethrin in adult X. laevis after 96 h of exposure. Both DDT and deltamethrin were shown to cause alterations in the liver metabolome of X. laevis. We also showed that some of these changes can be enhanced in exposure to a mixture of these two pesticides. Initial behavioural responses recorded directly after exposure were seen in the form of decreased activity, less alterations between mobility states, and less time spent at the water surface. This response persisted after 96 h of exposure to a mixture of the two pesticides. This study shows that sub-lethal exposure to pesticides can alter the biochemical homeostasis of frogs with the potential to cascade onto behavioural and ecological levels in mixture exposure scenarios.

TI  - Triadimefon in aquatic environments: occurrence, fate, toxicity, and ecological risk
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB  - Background As a triazole fungicide, triadimefon is widely used around the world. The ubiquitous occurrence of triadimefon in aquatic environments and potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms have resulted in global concerns. In this review, the current state of knowledge on occurrence, environmental behavior, and toxic effects are presented and used to conduct an assessment of risks posed by current concentrations of triadimefon in aquatic environments. Results The key findings from this review are that: (1) triadimefon occurred widely in surface waters, with high rates of detection; (2) abiotic degradation of triadimefon was affected by many factors. Stereoselectivity was found during biotic degradation and metabolism of triadimefon. Different enantiomers can cause various adverse effects, which complicates the assessment and requires enantiomers-specific considerations; (3) triadimefon exposure can affect organisms by causing multiple toxic effects on the thyroid, reproductive system, liver, nervous system as well as carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, and it can also act synergistically with other pesticides. Long-term, low-dose effects were considered to be the main characteristics of toxic effects of triadimefon; (4) results of the risk assessment based on probabilistic relationships represented by joint probability curves (JPCs) indicated that risk of triadimefon was classified as low risk. Conclusion Triadimefon occurred widely in surface waters, with high rates of detection, while the concentration data of triadimefon in surface water is insufficient. Researches about toxic effects and mechanisms of triadimefon on invertebrate are needed. Meanwhile, researches about toxic effects and environmental exposure of chiral monomers are also required. Due to its reproductive toxicity, triadimefon might result in adverse effects on the population level or even on the ecosystem level. Risk assessments for pesticides that cause long-term and low-dose effects on aquatic organisms such as triadimefon need to consider higher-level ecological risk.

TI  - Monitoring low-level mercury contamination by zebrafish school behavioral responses - 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Low-level pollution accidents are keeping increasing and difficult to monitor in real time. In our current study, zebrafish are used as a common freshwater model to monitor low-level concentrations of 0.05 mg.L-1 mercuric chloride (HgCl2). Avoidance (swimming increased and closely gathered) was the first response, but those abnormal behaviour just lasted 15 similar to 20 min and then recovered to the original level with much more fluctuation. In order to quantitative evaluate the first stress responses of fish exposed to lower concentration of toxicant, entropy is proposed for detecting the first responses. The use of entropy contributed to the reliability and precision for detecting toxicant at lower concentration pollution.

TI  - The developmental neurotoxicity of fipronil: Notochord degeneration and locomotor defects in zebrafish embryos and larvae
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide designed to selectively inhibit insect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Although fipronil is often used in or near aquatic environments, few studies have assessed the effects of this neurotoxicant on aquatic vertebrates at sensitive life stages. We explored the toxicological effects of fipronil on embryos and larvae using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) experimental model system. Embryos exposed to fipronil at nominal concentrations at or above 0.7 mu M (333 mu g/l) displayed notochord degeneration, shortening along the rostral-caudal body axis, and ineffective tail flips and uncoordinated muscle contractions along the body axis in response to touch. This phenotype closely resembles zebrafish locomotor mutants of the accordion class and is consistent with loss of reciprocal inhibitory neurotransmission by glycinergic commissural interneurons in the spinal cord. Consistent with the hypothesis that notochord degeneration may be due to abnormal mechanical stress from muscle tetany, the expression patterns of gene and protein markers specific to notochord development were unaffected by fipronil. Moreover, the degenerative effects of fipronil (1.1 mu M) were reversed by coexposure to the sodium channel blocker MS-222 (0.6mM). The notochord effects of fipronil were phenocopied by exposure to 70 mu M strychnine, a glycinergic receptor antagonist. In contrast, exposure to gabazine, a potent vertebrate GABA(A) antagonist, resulted in a hyperactive touch response but did not cause notochord degeneration. Although specifically developed to target insect GABA receptors with low vertebrate toxicity, our results suggest that fipronil impairs the development of spinal locomotor pathways in fish by inhibiting a structurally related glycine receptor subtype. This represents an unanticipated and potentially novel mechanism for fipronil toxicity in vertebrates.

TI  - Potential effects of internal physio-ecological changes on the online biomonitoring of water quality: The behavior responses with circadian rhythms of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to different chemicals
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The online biomonitoring of aquatic accidental pollution is very important to realize the assessment of complex toxicity. However, the monitoring results would be affected greatly by the internal physioecological changes of test organisms, and circadian rhythms might contribute greatly to this kind of effects. In the present study, the behavior responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to different concentrations of Deltamethrin, Atrazine, and Thallium (T1) in 15 days were investigated using an online behavior monitoring system. The results showed that the average behavior strength (BS) value of dark period (0.71 +/- 0.16) was lower than that of light period (0.88 +/- 0.09) in the control group. Similar pattern was observed in all other treatments with negative relationship between exposure concentrations and mean BS values. It is concluded that the 24 h circadian rhythms in the behavior responses of zebrafish (Dario rerio) could be observed clearly in the online biomonitoring system, and the online monitoring results would be affected obviously in the characteristics of behavior periodicity abnormal and time delay. Therefore, it is suggested that internal physio-ecological characteristics of organisms must be considered once they have the chance to play roles in bio-induced technologies. More investigations are warranted to clear the effects of internal physio-ecological changes on the exported results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-Term Exposure to Paraquat Alters Behavioral Parameters and Dopamine Levels in Adult Zebrafish (Danio Rerio)
T2  - ZEBRAFISH
AB  - Chronic exposure to paraquat (Pq), a toxic herbicide, can result in Parkinsonian symptoms. This study evaluated the effect of the systemic administration of Pq on locomotion, learning and memory, social interaction, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, and dopamine transporter (DAT) gene expression in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish received an i.p. injection of either 10mg/kg (Pq10) or 20mg/kg (Pq20) of Pq every 3 days for a total of six injections. Locomotion and distance traveled decreased at 24h after each injection in both treatment doses. In addition, both Pq10- and Pq20-treated animals exhibited differential effects on the absolute turn angle. Nonmotor behaviors were also evaluated, and no changes were observed in anxiety-related behaviors or social interactions in Pq-treated zebrafish. However, Pq-treated animals demonstrated impaired acquisition and consolidation of spatial memory in the Y-maze task. Interestingly, dopamine levels increased while DOPAC levels decreased in the zebrafish brain after both treatments. However, DAT expression decreased in the Pq10-treated group, and there was no change in the Pq20-treated group. The amount of TH protein showed no significant difference in the treated group. Our study establishes a new model to study Parkinson-associated symptoms in zebrafish that have been chronically treated with Pq.

TI  - Glyphosate and Roundup(®) alter morphology and behavior in zebrafish.
T2  - TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide in the world, due to the wide scale adoption of transgenic glyphosate resistant crops after its introduction in 1996. Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup(®). This pesticide contains several adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers, and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages, and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3days post-fertilization and adults were exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) or Roundup(®) (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) for 96h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup(®) exposure when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5mg/L, Roundup(®) at 0.065 or 0.5mg/L reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5mg/L of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5mg/L of Roundup(®)-treated adult zebrafish demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup(®) reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup(®), altering morphological and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity and cellular response.

TI  - Relative comparison of strobilurin fungicides at environmental levels: Focus on mitochondrial function and larval activity in early staged zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Strobilurin fungicides are used globally and have been detected in microgram per liter concentrations in aquatic environments. Here, we determined the potential toxicity of four commonly used strobilurins (azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin) on mitochondrial function and locomotor activity of larval zebrafish at an environmentally relevant level. As the mode of action of strobilurins in fungi is binding to cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III, we evaluated exposure effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of zebrafish, by measuring oxygen consumption rates, mitochondria-related enzyme activities, and transcripts levels for genes associated with the electron transfer chain and citric acid cycle. We found that 50 nM pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin lowered basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP respiration, and maximal respiration of embryos. Dysfunction in mitochondrial bioenergetics was associated with changes in mitochondrial complex III activity and transcripts of oxidative respiration and stress-related genes. Lower activity of complex III, and reduced cytb mRNA levels were hypothesized to contribute to reduced electron supply to complex IV and V. Both coxI and atp6 were up-regulated, suggesting a compensatory response to impaired oxidative respiration. Cluster analysis indicated that strobilurin-induced oxidative stress and cytb transcript were related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. We also assessed larval behavior responses, as reduced ATP can affect activity. We observed that pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin induced hypoactive responses in zebrafish. At 50 nM, azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl exerted no effects on mitochondrial function nor locomotion of zebrafish. Studies such as this are important for determining sublethal toxicity to these fungicides, as widespread detection of strobilurins in aquatic environments suggests there is a potential for adverse effects in aquatic organisms.

TI  - Glyphosate induces cardiovascular toxicity in Danio rerio
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Glyphosate is a broad spectrum herbicide used aggressively in agricultural practices as well as home garden care. Although labeled “safe” by the chemical industry, doses tested by industry do not mimic chronic exposures to sublethal doses that organisms in the environment are exposed to over long periods of time. Given the widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart. Treatment by embryo soaking with 50 mu g/ml glyphosate starting at gastrulation results in structural abnormalities in the atrium and ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs inversus as well as decreased heartbeats by 48 h as determined by live imaging and immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as determined using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects noted at 48 h post fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns during early cardiac patterning stages. We conclude that glyphosate is developmentally toxic to the zebrafish heart. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of cypermethrin in embryo-larval stages of zebrafish.
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Bifenthrin (BF) is widely used as a miticide in orchards, nurseries and homes due to its great photostability and insecticidal activity. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays. However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96 h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test compound with 96-h EC50 of 256 mu g L-1 for pericardial edema, and 109 mu g L-1 for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that zebrafish larvae of 96 hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to 50, 100, and 200 mu g L-1 from 3 to 84 hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120 hpf, larvae from the 50 mu g L-1 group seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150 mu g L-1 BF for 72 h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness.

TI  - Feeding behavior of early life stages of the zebrafish Danio rerio is altered by exposure to glyphosate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Glyphosate levels and the transfer of glyphosate across trophic levels have rarely been studied in zooplankton. The food preferences of zebrafish during the first-feeding stage (which is critical for the survival of organisms), were analyzed because of the requirement for live food. Larval survival begins to be affected when glyphosate intake exceeds 0.3666 mu g/larvae/day, in the case that only the food is contaminated; if the medium is also contaminated, the effects on survival start from 0.2456 mu g/larvae/day. It was shown that glyphosate was more likely to be incorporated through the medium than through the food (zooplankton), which supports the results of previous studies that have ruled out the potential for biomagnification. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of glyphosate was determined using an ELISA tests specific to measure glyphosate in the fish D. rerio, the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Lecane papuana, and the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. The experimental design consisted in exposing seven zebrafish adults per replica (four replicates) in three treatments 1, 5, and 10 mg/L of glyphosate for 96 h to obtain bioconcentration factors in the gills, liver, and muscle. These concentrations were selected as potential glyphosate concentrations right after application as double highest reported concentration. Glyphosate levels in zooplankton can represent up to 6.26% of the total weight of rotifers (BFC = 60.35) and in zebrafish adult organs were less than 8 mu g/mg of tissue (BCF values < 6). Although glyphosate does not biomagnify, our results suggest that glyphosate affected the dynamics between zooplankton and zebrafish larvae, diminishing survival and feeding rates, given that zooplankton species bioconcentrate glyphosate in large quantities. The BCF values found in this contribution are higher than expected. Glyphosate exposure affected energy metabolism and feeding behavior of zebrafish larvae, which presented high mortality rates at environmentally relevant concentrations.

TI  - Enantioselective aquatic toxicity and degradation in soil of the chiral fungicide oxathiapiprolin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Oxathiapiprolin is an efficient and chiral fungicide for peronosporomycetes. The enantioselective environmental behavior and ecotoxicity of oxathiapiprolin are still unclear. The enantioselectivity of oxathiapiprolin enantiomers was explored, including their acute toxicity toward aquatic plants (Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa and Soirodela polyrhiza) along with their influence on photosynthetic pigment production, the acute toxicity and morphological differences for the embryos, larvae and adult stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio), and the degradation in four typical soils (aerobic, anaerobic and sterilized conditions). The enantioselective toxicity of oxathiapiprolin showed that the toxicity of R-oxathiapiprolin was 1.8-2.1 times higher than that of S-oxathiapiprolin toward the two aquatic plants. In particular, the content of photosynthetic pigments decreased significantly stronger after exposure to R-oxathiapiprolin compared with S-oxathiapiprolin. The LC50 values of R-oxathiapiprolin in zebrafish in the different life stages were 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of S-oxathiapiprolin. The zebrafish embryos were most sensitive to the oxathiapiprolin enantiomers. After exposure to R-oxathiapiprolin, zebrafish embryos showed noticeable hatching delays, inhibition or deformation. R-oxathiapiprolin degraded preferentially in all four soils, with an enantiomeric fraction (EF) ranging from 0.28 to 0.42 under aerobic conditions. Enantioselective degradation was not found under anaerobic and sterilized conditions. The enantioselectivity of new chiral pesticides should be fully considered in risk assessments to provide a basis for the development and preparation of pure optical enantiomers.

TI  - The effect of the insecticide diazinon on the osmoregulation and the avoidance response of the white leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is salinity dependent
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Diazinon is one of the insecticides that represent a high risk for Costa Rican estuarine environments due to its widespread use in pineapple plantations. In estuaries, organisms are frequently submitted to stress caused by natural factors (e.g., continuous changes in salinity levels) and, additionally, to stress due to contamination. Therefore, the driving question of this study was: will organisms be more susceptible to suffer the deleterious effects caused by diazinon because of the stress resulting from the salinity changes? The estuarine shrimp Penaeus vannamei was used as the model organism and two responses were measured: osmoregulation (the physiological effect after a forced and continuous 24 h-exposure) and avoidance [the behavioural effect after a short (3 h) non-forced, multi-compartmented exposure]. Juveniles were exposed to diazinon (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) at three different salinities (10, 20 and 30). Disruption in the capacity to regulate the haemolymph osmotic pressure was observed at a salinity of 30 in individuals exposed to diazinon and methanol (used as vehicle). At that salinity, the ability of shrimps to detect and avoid the highest diazinon concentrations was impaired. P. vannamei juveniles inhabit environments with a high variation in salinity, but with an optimum osmotic point close to a salinity of 20; therefore, the higher the salinity, the greater the vulnerability of shrimps to the effects of diazinon. From an ecological point of view, this combined effect of salinity and contamination might also limit the spatial distribution of the organisms.

TI  - Environmental chemicals affect circadian rhythms: An underexplored effect influencing health and fitness in animals and humans
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Circadian rhythms control the life of virtually all organisms. They regulate numerous aspects ranging from cellular processes to reproduction and behavior. Besides the light-dark cycle, there are additional environmental factors that regulate the circadian rhythms in animals as well as humans. Here, we outline the circadian rhythm system and considers zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a representative vertebrate organism. We characterize multiple physiological processes, which are affected by circadian rhythm disrupting compounds (circadian disrupters). We focus on and summarize 40 natural and anthropogenic environmental circadian disrupters in fish. They can be divided into six major categories: steroid hormones, metals, pesticides and biocides, polychlorinated biphenyls, neuroactive drugs and other compounds such as cyanobacterial toxins and bisphenol A. Steroid hormones as well as metals are most studied. Especially for progestins and glucocorticoids, circadian dysregulation was demonstrated in zebrafish on the molecular and physiological level, which comprise mainly behavioral alterations. Our review summarizes the current state of knowledge on circadian disrupters, highlights their risks to fish and identifies knowledge gaps in animals and humans. While most studies focus on transcriptional and behavioral alterations, additional effects and consequences are underexplored. Forthcoming studies should explore, which additional environmental circadian disrupters exist. They should clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and aim to better understand the consequences for physiological processes.

TI  - DUAL ENANTIOSELECTIVE EFFECT OF THE INSECTICIDE BIFENTHRIN ON LOCOMOTOR BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT IN EMBRYONIC-LARVAL ZEBRAFISH
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Bifenthrin (BF) is a synthetic pyrethroid that targets the nervous system of insects and may have adverse effects on the behavior and development of nontarget organisms. However, no reports have been issued on the effects of different enantiomers on locomotor behavior for synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) in zebrafish, and whether locomotor activity is associated with the developmental toxicities remains unclear. In this study, enantioselectivity of BF (1S and 1R) on the acute locomotor activity and developmental toxicities of embryonic larval zebrafish were first evaluated. The results indicated that 1R-BF was more toxic, causing morphological impairments, with a 96-h median effective concentration (EC50) of 226 mu g/L for pericardial edema and 145 mu g/L for curved body axis. Administration of 201 mu g/L of one enantiomer of BF had differential effects on the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 4 d postfertilization (dpf) under alternating light and dark conditions. Larvae treated with 1R-BF were not sensitive to the alteration of light to dark, and the locomotor activities were reduced to a level similar to that observed in light, which otherwise increased rapidly and markedly. However, 1S-BF did not alter the general pattern of zebrafish response to the light or dark compared with the control. The results demonstrated that the differential effects on development might have contributed to the enantioselectivity in the locomotor activity. The consistency of enantioselectivity with insecticidal activity may also indicate a common mode of action. Furthermore, 1R-BF accelerated the spontaneous movement and hatching process, whereas 1S-BF seemed to be inhibitory. The results suggest the need to link behavioral changes to developmental toxicities in order to achieve more comprehensive health risk assessments of chiral pesticides. Environ. Toxicol.

T2  - BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Pesticides, as Temephos and Roundup, and surfactants, like Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), when discharged into the environment, are harmful to non-target wildlife, especially fish. To evaluate the effects of those chemicals alone and their binary combinations, we assessed the histological alterations in Danio rerio gills after 15 days of exposure to Temephos (1ppm), Roundup (10ppm), SDS (2ppm), SDS plus Temephos (2ppm+1ppm), SDS plus Roundup (2ppm+10ppm) and Temephos plus Roundup (1ppm+10ppm). Hyperplasia, a regressive change, was significant in all exposed groups. The progressive change, complete fusion of lamellae, was significantly intensive in Roundup plus Temephos group. Regarding circulatory disturbances, vascular congestion was significant intensive in SDS group, while severe aneurysm was observed in Roundup group. Although xenobiotics in the blend are biologically complex, mainly for long periods, combinatorial exposure incremented only complete fusion of lamellae. Our results reinforce the rationalization of indiscriminate use of those compounds alone or in combination.

TI  - Transcriptome network data in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) following exposure to the phenylpyrazole fipronil
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole pesticide that is used in both residential and agricultural applications. Fipronil is detected in run-offand water systems that are near areas in which the pesticide has been applied. The pesticide acts to antagonize gamma aminobutyric acid receptors, leading to overexcitation in the central nervous system. Fipronil has relatively high toxicity to fish, but the mechanisms underlying the toxicity are not well understood in embryonic stages. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to a single concentration of fipronil for 48 h at similar to 3-4 h-post-fertilization. Following a 7-day depuration phase, transcriptome and behavioral analyses were conducted. Transcriptomics identified neural processes as those differentially expressed with different doses of fipronil (0.2 mu g, 200 mu g and 2 mg fipronil/L). Gene networks associated with astrocyte differentiation, myelination, neural tube development, brain stem response, innervation, nerve regeneration, astrocyte differentiation, among other pathways were altered with exposure. In addition, miRNA-related events are disrupted by fipronil exposure and genes associated with primary or pri-miRNA processing were increased in larval fish exposed to the pesticide. These data present putative mechanisms associated with neurological impacts at later ages of zebrafish. This is important because it is not clear how early exposure to pesticides like fipronil affect central nervous system function and organisms later in life. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Developmental toxicity and transcriptome analysis of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos following exposure to chiral herbicide safener benoxacor
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Benoxacor, a chiral herbicide safener for S-metolachlor, has been detected in streams. However, the potential risk this poses to aquatic ecosystems is not clear. This study used zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to assess the enantioselective toxicity of benoxacor and its effects on biological activity and development from 2 h to 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). Results showed that benoxacor had negative effects on hatchability, malformations, and mortality. Compared to either individual enantiomer, embryos exposed to Rac-benoxacor had higher acute and developmental toxicities, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities, and nrf 2 expression levels. They also had lower superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme activity and krt 17, tbx 16, osx, cat, bcl 2, bax, and ifn expression levels. High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that Rac-benoxacor had a greater effect on gene regulation than either enantiomer. Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses demonstrated that changes in oxidoreductase activity, cellular lipid metabolic process, and catalytic activity related genes may be due to the enantioselective effects of benoxacor isomers. These results suggest that the ecotoxicology data and safety knowledge about the effects of chiral benoxacor on zebrafish should be considered in future environmental risk evaluation.

TI  - Zebrafish as a model for acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorus agent exposure and oxime reactivation - COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST CHEMICAL THREATS
AB  - The current research progression efforts for investigating novel treatments for exposure to organophosphorus (OP) compounds that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), including pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs), rely solely on in vitro cell assays and in vivo rodent models. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular, well-established vertebrate model in biomedical research that offers high-throughput capabilities and genetic manipulation not readily available with rodents. A number of research studies have investigated the effects of subacute developmental exposure to OP pesticides in zebrafish, observing detrimental effects on gross morphology, neuronal development, and behavior. Few studies, however, have utilized this model to evaluate treatments, such as oxime reactivators, anticholinergics, or anticonvulsants, following acute exposure. Preliminary work has investigated the effects of CWNA exposure. The results clearly demonstrated relative toxicity and oxime efficacy similar to that reported for the rodent model. This review surveys the current literature utilizing zebrafish as a model for OP exposure and highlights its potential use as a high-throughput system for evaluating AChE reactivator antidotal treatments to acute pesticide and CWNA exposure.

TI  - Acute toxicity of methomyl commercial formulation induces morphological and behavioral changes in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - The use of pesticides has continue grown over recent years, leading to several environmental and health concerns, such as the contamination of surface and groundwater resources and associated biota, potentially affecting populations that are not primary targets of these complex chemical mixtures. In this work, we investigate lethal and sublethal effects of acute exposure of methomyl commercial formulation in zebrafish embryo and larvae. Methomyl is a broad-spectrum carbamate insecticide and acaricide that acts primarily in acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChE). Methomyl formulation 96 h-LC50 was determined through the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test (FET) and resulted in 1.2 g/L +/- 0.04. Sublethal 6-day exposure was performed in six methomyl formulation concentrations (0.5; 1.0; 2.2; 4.8; 10.6; 23.3 mg/L) to evaluate developmental, physiological, morphological, behavioral, biochemical, and molecular endpoints of zebrafish early-development. Methomyl affected embryo hatching and larva morphology and behavior, especially in higher concentrations; resulting in smaller body and eyes size, failure in swimming bladder inflation, hypolocomotor activity, and concentration-dependent reduction of AChE activity; demonstrating methomyl strong acute toxicity and neurotoxic effect.

TI  - Enantioselectivity in tebuconazole and myclobutanil non-target toxicity and degradation in soils
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Tebuconazole and myclobutanil are two widely used triazole fungicides, both comprising two enantiomers with different fungicidal activity. However, their non-target toxicity and environmental behavior with respect to enantioselectivity have received limited attention. In the present study, tebuconazole and myclobutanil enantiomers were isolated and used to evaluate the occurrence of enantioselectivity in their acute toxicity to three non-target organisms (Scenedesmus obliquus, Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio). Significant differences were found: R-(-)-tebuconazole was about 1.4-5.9 times more toxic than S-(+)-tebuconazole; rac-myclobutanil was about 1.3-6.1 and 1.4-7.3 more toxic than (-)-myclobutanil and (+)-myclobutanil, respectively. Enantioselectivity was further investigated in terms of fungicide degradation in seven soil samples, which were selected to cover a broad range of soil properties. In aerobic or anaerobic soils, the S-(+)-tebuconazole degraded faster than R-(-)-tebuconazole, and the enantioselectivity showed a correlation with soil organic carbon content. (+)-Myclobutanil was preferentially degraded than (-)-myclobutanil in aerobic soils, whereas both enantiomers degraded at similar rates in anaerobic soils. Apparent correlations of enantioselectivity with soil pH and soil texture were observed for myclobutanil under aerobic conditions. In addition, both fungicides were configurationally stable in soils, i.e., no enantiomerization was found. Enantioselectivity may be a common phenomenon in both aquatic toxicity and biodegradation of chiral triazole fungicides, and this should be considered when assessing ecotoxicological risks of these compounds in the environment.

TI  - Developmental, behavioral, and reproductive effects experienced by Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) in response to short-term exposure to endosulfan
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to concentrations of 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0 mug/L of the pesticide endosulfan for 24 h beginning either 4-6 h postfertilization or 4-6 h posthatch to determine effects on hatching time, growth, mobility, foraging ability, and reproduction. Eggs exposed to endosulfan took longer to hatch, and the resulting fry were smaller at 1 week of age and had decreased mobility at 2 weeks of age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L) exhibiting the greatest response. These results suggest that short-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of a common pesticide may have long-term effects on growth, behavior, and reproduction in fish.

TI  - Enantioselective bioaccumulation and toxicity of the novel chiral antifungal agrochemical penthiopyrad in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides has been extensively used in agricultural production, which are not easily degrade in the environment and have various toxic effects on aquatic organisms. However, the toxic effects information to non-target organisms were mostly at the racemate level, which were poorly understood at the enantiomers level. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior and toxic effects of penthiopyrad in zebrafish. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed when exposed to penthiopyrad at two dose levels: S-(+)-penthiopyrad was preferentially accumulated. Moreover, S-(+)-penthiopyrad caused oxidative stress in zebrafish liver. The results of real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that exposure to penthiopyrad also enantioselectivity interfered with the expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, mtDNA synthesis, lipid metabolism and apoptosis-related genes. S-(+)-penthiopyrad significantly decreased most of the expression of the above gene, which showed higher toxic effects. We inferred that the toxicity mechanism of penthiopyrad was caused by lipid metabolism disorder and mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish, and further leads to apoptosis even DNA damage. This study provides more accurate data to investigate the environmental impact of penthiopyrad at the enantiomer level.

TI  - 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicide effects on zebrafish larvae: development, neurotransmission and behavior as sensitive endpoints
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Assessment of pesticides toxicity using zebrafish early life stages is relevant for aquatic systems safety. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos from 3 h post fertilization to 96 hpf. A set of 2,4-D concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 80 mg/L were tested and median lethal concentration (LC50) at 96-h was calculated as 2.86 mg/L. A sub-teratogenic concentrations range from 0.02 to 0.8 mg/L was then used to assess effects at ontogenic, biochemical, and behavioral levels. The main developmental defects were tail deformities and pericardial edema at concentrations equal or above 0.32 mg/L. Cholinesterase activity (at 96 hpf) and larvae swimming behavior (at 120 hpf) were affected even at the lowest tested dose (0.02 mg/L). The behavior analysis was a sensitive endpoint, with a decrease in the swimming distance of exposed larvae during light period. The effect of 2,4-D in ChE was translated by an inhibition of the enzyme activity in all treated groups. These findings demonstrate that 2,4-D can alter the cholinergic system by affecting ChE activity which may be involved in the locomotion reduction of exposed larvae and emphasize the potential of neurotransmission and behavioral endpoints as early warning signs of herbicides contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Biochemical and Behavioral Responses in Zebrafish Exposed to Imidacloprid Oxidative Damage and Antioxidant Responses
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is an insecticide used worldwide, a neonicotinoid that could cause toxicity in non-target organisms. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model organism widely used in different fields of research such as behavioral studies, biochemical parameters as well as neurotoxicity research. Here, we investigate whether the exposure to three concentrations (0.15, 15, and 45 mu g/L) of IMI for 96 h alters responses in zebrafish. Oxidative stress parameters and acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) as well as the behavioral responses of locomotion were measured. IMI exposure decreased distance traveled in fish exposed to the 45 mu g/L. In the exploratory activity, time spent and transitions to the top area of the water column decreased in fish exposed to all concentrations of IMI. In addition, exposures to 45 and 15 mu g/L of IMI decreased episodes of erratic movement in the zebrafish. Exposures to IMI at a concentration of 45 mu g/L decreased the time spent in erratic movements and increased the time spent with no movement (i.e., “freezing”). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was increased in the brain of zebrafish exposed for 96 h to concentrations of 0.15 and 45 mu g/L. Brain AChE activity was reduced and the levels of carbonyl protein (CP) increased in brain of zebrafish at concentrations of 15 and 45 mu g/L. Lipid peroxidation measured by TBARS and, also non-protein thiols (NPSH) did not show any variation in the brain of zebrafish exposed to IMI. Changes in the activity of cholinergic neurotransmitters in the brain tissues of zebrafish indicate IMI toxicity. Exposures of fish over 96 h to IMI at a nominal concentration of 45 mu g/L caused more extensive sublethal responses in zebrafish, but this concentration is well above those expected in the aquatic environment. Studies are warranted to evaluate the effects on behavior and biomarker responses in fish exposed over longer periods to IMI at environmentally relevant concentrations.

TI  - Paraquat affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, dopamine system expression, and locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The dipyridyl herbicide paraquat induces oxidative stress in cells and is implicated in adult neurodegenerative diseases. However, less is known about paraquat toxicity in early stages of vertebrate development. To address this gap, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 mu M paraquat for 96 h. Paraquat did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in embryos and larvae, but it did accelerate time to hatch. To evaluate whether mitochondrial respiration was related to earlier hatch times, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole embryos. Maximal respiration of embryos exposed to 100 mu M paraquat for 24 h was reduced by more than 70%, suggesting that paraquat negatively impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics in early development. Based upon this evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional responses of oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes were measured. Fish exposed to 1 mu M paraquat showed higher expression levels of superoxide dismutase 2, heat shock protein 70, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2a compared to control fish. No differences among groups were detected in larvae exposed to 10 and 100 mu M paraquat, suggesting a non-monotonic response. We also measured endpoints related to larval behavior and dopaminergic signaling as paraquat is associated with degeneration of dopamine neurons. Locomotor activity was stimulated with 100 mu M paraquat and dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor 3 mRNA levels were increased in larvae exposed to 1 mu M paraquat, interpreted to be a compensatory response at lower concentrations. This study improves mechanistic understanding into the toxic actions of paraquat on early developmental stages. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Synthetic organic chemicals (flame retardants and pesticides) with neurotoxic potential induced behavioral impairment on zebrafish (Danio rerio): a non-invasive approach for neurotoxicology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Behavior responses of organisms can be used as a non-invasive method for neurotoxicology studies since it directly links the nervous system's functioning and biochemical activities. Among different behavioral activities, aquatic organisms' swimming behavior (fitness) is the essential factor for health assessment; thus, it is practiced routinely in neurotoxicological studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are excellent models for neurotoxicology studies. Based on the above information, we hypothesized that zebrafish's swimming behavior is a potential biomarker for neurotoxic effect assessment. We exposed zebrafish (length, 3-4 cm; weight, 0.2-0.3 g) to different synthetic organic chemicals (organophosphorus flame retardants (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl phosphate) and neurotoxic pesticides (cypermethrin and methomyl) for 15 days. For each test chemical, we chose two different concentrations (Treatment-I 5 mu L/L and Treatment-II 25 mu L/L) to study their eco-toxicity. The swimming strength of zebrafish was quantified using an online monitoring system. The swimming strength of zebrafish decreased under different treatments (Treatment-I (5 mu L/L) and -II (25 mu L/L)) of target chemicals. The circadian rhythm of zebrafish was predominantly not affected in this study. Higher neurotoxic effect (behavioral impairment) was observed in Treatment-II when compare to Treatment-I of organophosphorus flame retardants and pesticides groups. Responses of zebrafish under organophosphorus flame retardant (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl phosphate) treatments were identical with pesticide (cypermethrin and methomyl) treatments. Based on the results, we conclude that swimming behavior could be an ideal non-invasive biomarker to assess waterborne contaminants' neurotoxic effect.

TI  - Is the Synthetic Fungicide Fosetyl-Al Safe for the Ecotoxicological Models Danio rerio and Enchytraeus crypticus?
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Worldwide, pesticides have contaminated the environment, affecting non-target species. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of fosetyl-Al (FOS) on model organisms. Based on the 3 Rs for animal research and described guidelines, the OECD 236 and 220 were applied with some modifications. The FOS test concentrations were 0.02-0.2-2-20-200 mg/L for Danio rerio and 250-500-750-1000-1250 mg/kg for Enchytraeus crypticus. Besides the standard endpoints, additional endpoints were evaluated (D. rerio: behavior and biochemical responses; E. crypticus: extension of exposure duration (28 d (days) + 28 d) and organisms' sizes). For D. rerio, after 96 h (h), hatching was inhibited (200 mg/L), proteins' content increased (2 and 20 mg/L), lipids' content decreased (2 mg/L), glutathione S-transferase activity increased (2 mg/L), and, after 120 h, larvae distance swam increased (20 mg/L). For E. crypticus, after 28 d, almost all the tested concentrations enlarged the organisms' sizes and, after 56 d, 1250 mg/kg decreased the reproduction. In general, alterations in the organisms' biochemical responses, behavior, and growth occurred at lower concentrations than the effects observed at the standard endpoints. This ecotoxicological assessment showed that FOS may not be considered safe for the tested species, only at higher concentrations than the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). This research highlighted the importance of a multi-endpoint approach to assess the (eco)toxic effects of the contaminants.

TI  - Paternal exposure to a common herbicide alters the behavior and serotonergic system of zebrafish offspring
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Increasingly, studies are revealing that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can alter animal behavior. Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.

TI  - Behavioral and developmental toxicity assessment of the strobilurin fungicide fenamidone in zebrafish embryos/larvae (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Strobilurin fungicides are among the most widely used in the world and have characteristics that include high water solubility and toxicity to aquatic organisms. While several studies report on mechanisms of toxicity of strobilurins in fish, there are no data on the sub-lethal toxicity of fish to the fungicide fenamidone. To address this gap, survival and hatch rate, deformities, mitochondrial bioenergetics, expression of oxidative stress and apoptotic genes, and behavior (locomotor activity and anxiolytic-related behaviors) were assessed in zebrafish embryos and larvae following exposure to fenamidone. Fenamidone negatively affected development of zebrafish embryos, causing a delay of hatching time at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mu M. Fenamidone caused morphological deformities in zebrafish, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail deformities, and spinal curvature. Exposure to 1.5 mu M fenamidone reduced surface area of swim bladder in larvae at 6 dpf. Fenamidone significantly reduced oxygen consumption rates of embryos; 5 mu M fenamidone decreased basal respiration (similar to 85%), oligomycin induced ATP-linked respiration (similar to 70%), FCCP-induced maximal respiration (similar to 75%) and nonmitochondrial respiration (similar to 90%) compared to controls. Sod2 mRNA levels were decreased by fenamidone in larval fish. Locomotor activity was significantly decreased in zebrafish larvae following exposure to 2 mu M fenamidone but there was no evidence for anxiolytic nor anxiety-related behaviors (exposures of 100 nM up to 1.5 mu M). This study addresses a data gap for potential risks associated with fenamidone exposure in developing fish.

TI  - Dichlorvos alters morphology and behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl-dimethylphosphate), an organophosphorus pesticide used for indoor insect and livestock parasite control, is among the most common commercially available pesticides, However, there are significant concerns over its toxicity, especially due to its relative stability in water, soil, and air. Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization). Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish. The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Low-concentration exposure to glyphosate-based herbicide modulates the complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and induces mitochondrial hyperpolarization in the Danio rerio brain
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl-glycine) (GLY) is the active ingredient of the most used herbicides in the world. GLY is applied in formulated products known as glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), which could induce effects that are not predicted by toxicity assays with pure GLY. This herbicide is classified as organophosphorus compound, which is known to induce neurotoxic effects. Although this compound is classified as non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies, acute exposure to GBH causes neurological symptoms in humans. However, there is no consensus in relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of the GBH in the zebrafish Danio rerio, focusing on acute toxicity, the activity and transcript levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive species (RS) formation, and behavioral repertoire. Adult zebrafish were exposed in vivo to three concentrations of GBH Scout (R), which contained GLY in formulation (fGLY) (0.065,1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 fGLY) for 7 d, and an in vitro assay was performed using also pure GLY. Our results show that GBH induced in zebrafish brain a decrease in cell viability, inhibited mitochondrial complex enzymatic activity, modulated gene expression related to mitochondrial complexes, induced an increase in RS production, promoted hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane, and induced behavioral impairments. Together, our data contributes to the knowledge of the neurotoxic effects of GBH. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a relevant cellular response that should not be disregarded. Moreover, this study pointed to the mitochondria as an important target of GBH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Chlorpyrifos and malathion have opposite effects on behaviors and brain size that are not correlated to changes in AChE activity
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Organophosphates, a type of neurotoxicant pesticide, are used globally for the treatment of pests on croplands and are therefore found in a large number of conventional foods. These pesticides are harmful and potentially deadly if ingested or inhaled in large quantities by causing a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the central and peripheral nervous system. However, much less is known about the effects of exposure to small quantities of the pesticides on neural systems and behavior during development. In the current study we used zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects of two of the most widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on zebrafish behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the organophosphates during different time points in development and then tested at 5 days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental and AChE abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that chlorpyrifos and malathion cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such as swim speed (hypoactivity vs. hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally, the pesticides affect only certain behaviors, such as thigmotaxis, during specific time points in development that are unrelated to changes in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not chlorpyrifos also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions compared to controls by 5 days postfertilization. We conclude that exposure to very low concentrations of organophosphate pesticides during development cause abnormalities in behavior and brain size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Behavioural toxicity of environmental relevant concentrations of a glyphosate commercial formulation - RoundUp® UltraMax - During zebrafish embryogenesis.
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The use of herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient (a.i.) has increased dramatically in recent years, with its residues often being found in either soil or water. Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp (R) UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2 and 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for 72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations. Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae exposed to 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory- motor coordination during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should not be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - EVIDENCE FOR BEHAVIORAL PREFERENCE TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATIONS OF URBAN-USE HERBICIDES IN A MODEL ADULT FISH
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Fish live in waters of contaminant flux. In three urban, fish-bearing waterways of British Columbia, Canada, we found the active ingredients of WeedEx (R), KillEx (R), and Roundup (R) herbicide formulations (2,4-D, dicamba, glyphosate, and mecoprop) at low to high ng/L concentrations (0.26 to 309 ng/L) in routine conditions, i.e., no rain for at least one week. Following rain, these concentrations increased by an average of eightfold, suggesting runoff as a major route of herbicide introduction in these waterways. To determine whether fish might be able to limit point-source exposures through sensory-driven behaviors, we introduced pulses of representative herbicide mixtures to individual adult zebrafish (a model species) in flow-through tanks. Fish did the opposite of limit exposure; they chose to spend more time in pulses of herbicide mixtures representative of those that may occur with rain events. This attraction response was not altered by a previous 4-d exposure to lower concentrations of the mixtures, suggesting fish will not learn from previous exposures. However, previous exposures did alter an attraction response to an amino acid prevalent in food (L-alanine). The present study demonstrates that fish living within urban waterways may elect to place themselves in herbicide-contaminated environments and that these exposures may alter their behavioral responses to cues necessary for survival.

TI  - Tebuconazole reduces basal oxidative respiration and promotes anxiolytic responses and hypoactivity in early-staged zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Triazole fungicides are increasingly used in North America to combat mold and fungi, in order to protect vegetables, citrus, ornamental plants and field crops. To determine the biological impacts of tebuconazole in nontarget aquatic organisms, early life stage zebrafish were exposed to 0.1-100 mu M tebuconazole for 120 h (5 dpf). There was a significant increase in mortality over time and at 100 mu M, only 50% of the animals survived 96 h compared to > 95% for all other experimental groups. There was evidence for increased hatching time with 10 mu M tebuconazole compared to the control group (similar to 7 h longer at 50% total hatch) or a lack of hatch observed with 100 mu M. Oxidative respiration and behavior were evaluated to assess whether the fungicide impaired energy-associated processes. Oxygen consumption rates in embryos (exposed from similar to 6 hpf) were determined with exposure to 2.5, 25, 50, 100 pM tebuconazole for 24 h using the XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Embryos treated with 100 pM showed a similar to 60% reduction in basal respiration, indicating impaired oxygen consumption and/or changes in resource allocation (e.g. anti-oxidant production, metabolite synthesis). Environmentally-relevant concentrations of tebuconazole did not affect oxidative phosphorylation. As behavior is a sensitive endpoint for toxicity, we measured the dark photokinesis response and conducted a light-dark preference test in 6 dpf larvae following a sub-chronic exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M tebuconazole beginning with 6 hpf embryos. It was observed in two independent experiments for dark photokinesis that 10 mu M tebuconazole reduced total distance moved (i.e. hypoactivity) in the dark period by similar to 25-35%. In the light-dark preference test, there was an increase for mean time in dark zone (similar to 100% increase in the average time/visits per second) and frequency in dark zone (increase of similar to 35% in average number of visits) with tebuconazole, suggestive of anxiolytic behavior at environmentally-relevant doses. This study demonstrates that exposure to tebuconazole can affect survival, hatch time, oxidative phosphorylation, and behavioral activity of early-staged zebrafish. While survival, hatch time, and mitochondrial bioenergetics were not different than control fish at environmentally-relevant levels of tebuconazole, behavioral responses were detected at concentrations reported in some aquatic environments.

TI  - Biomarkers of pyrethroid toxicity in fish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB  - Pesticides contribute to human welfare by reducing vector-borne diseases and protecting crops against pests. Insecticides are the most widely employed pesticides for agricultural, domestic, and industrial pest control. However, some insecticides such as synthetic pyrethroids, analogs of the natural pyrethrin, persist in the environment and result in different hostile effects on nontarget organisms. Due to a continuous increase in the use of pyrethroids and their widespread application, different generations and types of pyrethroids have been frequently reported from environmental media, biota, and residential areas. Synthetic pyrethroids are observed to be less toxic to mammal and birds, relatively toxic to amphibians, and highly toxic to aquatic organisms including fish. Here, we review the occurrence, fate, biotransformation, and bioavailability of pyrethroids in waters. We also present biomarkers used to evidence toxicological effects of pyrethroids on fish. Toxic effects include oxidative stress and damage such as production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation; neurological behavioral inconsistencies; developmental effects such as delayed development and signaling; biochemical alterations of protein, glucose, and enzymes; hematological changes in white blood cells, red blood cells, and hemoglobin; physiological effects on metabolism and heart function; histopathological changes in the brain, liver, and gills; molecular toxicity including DNA damage, micronuclei induction, and altered gene or mRNA expression; and reproductive or endocrine disruption, e.g., disrupted pathways and signaling. Mechanisms of toxicity and control measures are also discussed.

TI  - Thifluzamide exposure induced neuro-endocrine disrupting effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Thifluzamide is widely used fungicide and frequently detected in aquatic system. In this study, the toxicity of fungicide thifluzamide to non-targeted aquatic organisms was investigated for neuroendocrine disruption potentials. Here, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a series of concentrations of thifluzamide for 6 days. The results showed that both the development of embryos/larvae and the behavior of hatched larvae were significantly affected by thifluzamide. Importantly, the decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and the increased contents of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), along with transcriptional changes of nervous system related genes were observed following 4 days exposure to thifluzamide. Besides, the decreased contents of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in whole body, as well as significant expression alteration in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis associated genes were discovered in zebrafish embryos after 4 days of exposure to thifluzamide. Our results clearly demonstrated that zebrafish embryos exposed to thifluzamide could disrupt neuroendocrine, compromise behavior and induce developmental abnormality, suggesting impact of this fungicide on developmental programming in zebrafish.

TI  - Biological impacts of organophosphates chlorpyrifos and diazinon on development, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare the biological responses in developing zebrafish to two organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZN). Zebrafish embryos were exposed to either solvent control (0.1% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 25.0 μM CPF, as well as one dose of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 μM DZN for 96 h. CPF at 10.0 and 25.0 μM caused 70-80% and 100% mortality in embryos after 96 h exposure, whereas embryos treated with 10.0 and 100.0 μM DZN showed 30-40% and 70-80% lethality. CPF at 10.0 μM significantly decreased cumulative hatching rate, whereas hatching rate was significantly reduced in embryos treated with 100.0 μM DZN. Spinal lordosis was primarily observed in larvae exposed to 1.0 and 10.0 μM CPF, whereas pericardial edema was mainly detected with 10.0 and 100.0 μM DZN exposure. Embryo exposed to 1.0, 10.0 and 25.0 μM CPF exhibited no mitochondrial dysfunction; exposure to 100.0 μM DZN significantly inhibited mitochondrial bioenergetics. To determine if CPF and DZN affected larval activity, dark photokinesis response was assessed in larvae following 7 days exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 μM CPF, as well as to 0.1 1.0, and 10.0 μM DZN. Larvae exposed to 1.0 μM CPF showed hypoactivity, whereas the activity in the dark was not overtly changed in larvae exposed to DZN. In summary, CPF showed higher developmental toxicity compared to DZN. Moreover, based on the types of morphological deformities noted, as well as differences in locomotor activity, we conclude that OPs have unique chemical-specific modes of action that can result in varied biological responses during early development.

TI  - Endosulfan suppresses growth and reproduction in zebrafish
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - To study the effects of endosulfan, a mild estrogen-mimic, on survival, growth and reproduction of the model zebrafish Danio rerio, the hatchlings were discretely immersed at selected doses (44-1400 ng/l) for 14 h. Immersion at the dose of 350 ng/l resulted in 12 and 27% mortality at the end of the treatment and at the age of sexual maturity respectively, as well as in the production of 72% females. The frequency of `juveniles' increased from 17% at 44 ng/l to 44 % at 1400 ng/l. Endosulfan acted as a growth suppressant and the magnitude of its suppression increased in the order of female > male > juveniles. During the 240-day experiment, it also postponed sexual maturity in females from the 120th dph (day post-hatching) in the control to the 181st dph in those treated at 1400 ng/l, reduced the spawning frequency (16-3 times) and cumulative fecundity (1424-159 eggs) by affecting the processes of maturation of eggs and vitellogenesis. In the treated but persisting males, it postponed sexual maturity (120-129th dph) and reduced fertilizability (91-13%) by reducing the motility duration of the sperm.

TI  - Cluster analysis profiling of behaviors in zebrafish larvae treated with antidepressants and pesticides
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Antidepressants are used by a substantial number of women in their childbearing years. Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since untreated depression poses a risk to the mother and child. However, many antidepressants readily pass through the placental barrier to reach the fetus or may be ingested by the newborn via breastmilk. Little is known about the effects of antidepressants on brain development and subsequent behavior in young children. In the current study, we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the neurodevelopmental effects of three commonly prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and bupropion. Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant exposures lead to specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. At present, it is not known if antidepressants have similar effects in human development.

TI  - Myofibrilar functional dysregulation in fish: A new biomarker of damage to pesticides
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Endosulfan (ES) modifies the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibers and causes changes to the swimming behavior of fish. The objectives of the present work were to evaluate, in fishes of Australoheros facetus, 1) the integrity of myofibrils (Mf) by the analysis of SDS-PAGE profiles, and 2) the functionality of Mf through the microscopically monitoring of the contraction and changes in Mg2+ Ca2+- ATPase and Mg2+(EGTA)-ATPase activities. As expected, after the addition of the contraction buffer, control fish Mf contracted. On the contrary, Mf from fish exposed at 0.5 mu g/L ES showed a partial contraction and none of the fish exposed at 10 mu g/L ES contracted. As judged by its high Mg2+ Ca2+ ATPase activity and low Mg2+ (EGTA) ATPase activity, control Mf showed good functionality. In Mf from fish exposed to 0.5 and 10 mu g/L ES the activities of these enzymes were similar, suggesting denaturation or degradation of some component of tropomyosin troponin complex. SDS-PAGE patterns of Mf from fish exposed to ES showed degradation of the myosin heavy chain and of tropomyosin. Similar values of lipid peroxidation (TSARS) were found in both control and exposed Mf, suggesting that lipid oxidation was not be related to the above-mentioned changes. The observed effects expand the knowledge of ES action in muscles and could be used as biomarkers of damage in fishes exposed to organochlorine compounds like the insecticide endosulfan.

TI  - Long-term exposure to cyprodinil causes abnormal zebrafish aggressive and antipredator behavior through the hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal axis
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Cyprodinil, one of the main pyrimidinamine fungicides, has been used to control fungal diseases in plants and vegetables worldwide. Previous studies have investigated the influences of cyprodinil on the developmental and reproductive toxicity of fish. However, it remains unknown whether it affects fish behaviors and the underlying mechanisms. In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to 240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration) and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1–10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1–10 μg/L). In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal gland axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover, these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator behavior during the predator avoidance test. Overall, the data provided herein further our understanding of cyprodinil toxicity and can be used to assess the ecological effects of cyprodinil on the induction of abnormal behaviors at the environmental level. © 2021

TI  - Developmental sub-chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos reduces anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Neurobehavioral disorders such as anxiety, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders are typically influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Although several genetic risk factors have been identified in recent years, little is known about the environmental factors that either cause neurobehavioral disorders or contribute to their progression in genetically predisposed individuals. One environmental factor that has raised concerns is chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide that is widely used in agriculture and is found ubiquitously in the environment. In the present study, we examined the effects of sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure on anxiety-related behavior during development using zebrafish larvae. We found that sub-chronic exposure to 0.01 or 0.1 mu M chlorpyrifos during development induces specific behavioral defects in 7-day-old zebrafish larvae. The larvae displayed decreases in swim speed and thigmotaxis, yet no changes in avoidance behavior were seen. Exposure to 0.001 mu M chlorpyrifos did not affect swimming, thigmotaxis, or avoidance behavior and exposure to 1 mu M chlorpyrifos induced behavioral defects, but also induced defects in larval morphology. Since thigmotaxis, a preference for the edge, is an anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae, we propose that sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure interferes with the development of anxiety-related behaviors. The results of this study provide a good starting point for examination of the molecular, cellular, developmental, and neural mechanisms that are affected by environmentally relevant concentrations of organophosphate pesticides. A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms is important for the development of predictive models and refined health policies to prevent toxicant-induced neurobehavioral disorders.

TI  - Investigation into the sub-lethal effects of the triazole fungicide triticonazole in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos/larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Global use of azole fungicides is expected to increase over the next several years. Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that is used for turf protection, residential, and other commercial applications. As such, it can enter local rural and urban water systems via run-off and rain events. Early life stages of aquatic organisms can be susceptible to pesticides that enter the water, but in the case of triticonazole, data on the potential for subacute toxicity are lacking. Here, we determined the effects of triticonazole on development, oxygen consumption rates, and locomotor activity in zebrafish to address this knowledge gap. Wild-type zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to triticonazole (1-100 mu M) in early development for different lengths of time depending on the assay conducted. Triticonazole did not affect survival nor induce significant deformity (pericardial edema, skeletal defects) in zebrafish at doses up to 100 mu M. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in embryos after 24 and 48 hour exposure to triticonazole beginning at similar to 6 hpf using the XFe flux analyzer. Triticonazole did not affect basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration, FCCP-induced maximum respiration, proton leak, spare capacity, nor non-mitochondrial respiration at doses up to 100 mu M for 24 hours, even for exposure up to 250 mu M for 48 hours. To determine whether the fungicide affected larval swimming activity, the visual motor response test was conducted following triticonazole exposure for 6 days. Larval zebrafish exposed to triticonazole showed hypoactivity in the dark following a 100 mu M treatment, suggesting that the fungicide can affect the locomotor activity of zebrafish, albeit at relatively high levels. Given the fact that sublethal biological responses were absent at lower environmentally relevant concentrations, we conclude that triticonazole, relative to other triazole fungicides and types of pesticides, exhibits a relatively low risk of toxicity to the early life stages of fish.

TI  - Ecological risk of pesticide contamination in a Brazilian river located near a rural area: A study of biomarkers using zebrafish embryos
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Aquatic environments are affected by the use of pesticides in agricultural areas near rivers. To assess the impact of pesticide residues on affected environments Denio rerio (zebrafish) embryos have become an alternative model for biomonitoring studies. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were used as bioindicator of water quality in the Vacacaf river, located in the city of Santa Maria, southern Brazil. We hypothesized that it would be possible to observe changes in the biomarkers tested in the embryos. Exposures were performed over a total of eight months during the year 2018 using water collected in a river located near agricultural areas. Twenty-four pesticides were found in river water samples. The most frequently found were atrazine, quinclorac and domazone. During exposure (96 h) spontaneous movement, the heart rate and hatching rate were evaluated. After the exposure time the embryos were euthanized for biochemical assays. We analyzed biomarkers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT). We observed increases in GST and TBARS, especially during periods of major water contamination such as January, February, October, and November. Pesticides can affect the development of native species that reproduce during periods of high agricultural production. These results demonstrate the potential use of biochemical parameters combined with developmental and behavioral analyses in zebrafish embryos for biomonitoring studies.

TI  - The Use of Zebrafish ( Danio rerio) Behavioral Responses in Identifying Sublethal Exposures to Deltamethrin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Alterations of fish behavioral responses are sensitive indicators to identify accidental chemical pollution. In this research, a series of exposure tests were conducted to investigate behavioral changes of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to deltamethrin (DM) in six concentrations of 0, 0.15, 1.5, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 g/L. Swimming changes in zebrafish were detected at a concentration as low as 1% of the LC50-24h within five hours. Hyperactivity was the first response, followed by a second response of fish surfacing. The change patterns of swimming speed in zebrafish were similar in all exposure groups, but the degree increased with increasing concentrations. Swimming speed and depth were altered within the first two hours after exposure, which was regarded as the most vital phase for water quality monitoring. The duration of hyperactivity and the time of zebrafish surfacing were both logarithmically correlated with exposure concentrations, which was helpful to distinguish the level of pollution.

TI  - Detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals in Danio rerio and Daphnia pulex: Step-one, behavioral screen
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Anthropogenic surface and ground water contamination by chemicals is a global problem, and there is an urgent need to develop tools to identify and elucidate biological effects. Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are not typically monitored or regulated and those with known or suspected endocrine disrupting potential have been termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Many CECs are known to be neurotoxic (e.g., insecticides) and many are incompletely characterized. Behavioral responses can identify chemicals with neuroactive properties, which can be relevant to EDC mechanisms (e.g., neuroendocrine disturbances). Two freshwater species, Daphnia pulex and Danio rerio, were evaluated for swimming behavior alterations resulting from 24-hr exposure to 9 CECs: triclosan, triclocarban, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, 4-nonylphenol, bisphenol-A, atrazine, metformin, and estrone. This is the first step in the development of a bioassay for detecting estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic activity with the goal to evaluate complex mixtures of uncharacterized contaminants in water samples. The second step, described in a subsequent report, examines transcriptome alterations following chemical exposure. Significant differences in the swimming behavior response and sensitivity were found across chemicals within a species and across species for a given chemical in this unique optical bioassay system. In the concentration ranges studied, significant behavioral alterations were detected for 6 of 9 CECs for D. pulex and 4 of 9 CECs for D. rerio. These results underscore the utility of this bioassay to identify behavioral effects of sublethal concentrations of CECs before exploration of transcriptomic alterations for EDC detection.

TI  - Vitamin E reduces endosulfan-induced toxic effects on morphology and behavior in early development of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate if vitamin E (alpha-TOC) modulates the developmental toxicity of the pesticide endosulfan (ESF), using a modified zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed from 6 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) to either ESF (0.1-50 mg/L) or alpha-TOC (0.01 3 mM) alone or in combination. The effects of these exposures on embryonic morphology, larval behavior and antioxidant gene expression were analyzed. Phenotypic analysis at 48 hpf showed that ESF led to a dose-dependent increase in embryonic deformities, including axis malformations, pericardial edema and reduced pigmentation. Co-exposure of ESF with a-TOC (1-3 mM) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ESF-induced embryonic malformations. Exposure to solely alpha-TOC did not affect rates of survival or malformations. Behavior studies showed that ESF caused hyperactivity at 5 days post fertilization, indicating a developmental neurotoxic effect. The ESF-induced hyperactivity was ameliorated by alpha-TOC. Elevated ESF concentrations caused down-regulation of the antioxidant genes cuzn-sod, gpxl a and cat, suggesting that ESF promoted oxidative stress in the embryos. alpha-TOC did not prevent the ESF-induced dysregulation of these genes. These results demonstrate that alpha-TOC protects against phenotypic and behavioral effects caused by ESF but did not rescue ESF-induced aberrations in antioxidant gene expression.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Dichlorvos-induced developmental toxicity in Zebrafish
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL HEALTH
AB  - The present study examined effects of the pesticide dichlorvos (O-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-O,O dimethylphosphate [DDVP]) on embryonic development of zebrafish. In a first set of experiments, early life stages of zebrafish were exposed to five concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L(-1)) of DDVP for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). The 24-hpf LC(50) value of DDVP in the semistatic test was 39.75 mg/L(-1). Developmental abnormalities have been observed in embryos and larvae, such as no blood flow, cardiac edema, delayed hatching, and vertebra malformations. Most of the onserved effects were increased in a concentration-dependent manner. To investigate the behavior of the larvae, zebrafish exposed to 10 and 25 mg/L(-1) DDVP were observed on days 6 and 9 after fertilization. 25 mg L(-1) DDVP dose caused significant slowing of swimming activity on day 6 and 9 after fertilization. According to present study results, DDVP exposure during early development caused (i) clear behavioral impairments detectable during the posthatching period and (ii) mortality and developmental abnormalities in zebrafish. Dichlorvos is present in the environment with other similar organophosphate compounds. Additive responses to organophosphate compounds may induce lethal or sublethal effects in early life stages of fish chronically exposed to this class of chemicals.

TI  - Environmentally relevant mixture of S-metolachlor and its two metabolites affects thyroid metabolism in zebrafish embryos
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Herbicides and their metabolites are often detected in water bodies where they may cause adverse effects to non-target organisms. Their effects at environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements, heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 mu g/L) and the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of 21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in larvae exposed to more than 100 mu g/L of individual substances (craniofacial deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 mu g/L of each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found. Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53 gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each substance; MESA 30 mu g/L; and MOA 100 mu g/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) and MESA metabolite (1 mu g/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the thyroid system disruption represents a likely hypothesis behind the effects caused by the low environmental concentrations of S-metolachlor, its two metabolites and their mixture.

TI  - Mitochondrial bioenergetics and locomotor activity are altered in zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to the bipyridylium herbicide diquat
T2  - TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Diquat is a non-selective bipyridylium herbicide which has replaced its sister compound paraquat, as paraquat is associated to an increased risk for Parkinson's disease. However, the propensity of diquat to propagate reactive oxygen species ensures that diquat remains an exposure risk in non-target organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to diquat (1, 10, 100 mu M) beginning at similar to 6 h post fertilization for up to 7 days to learn more about the mechanisms underlying diquat toxicity during vertebrate development. Zebrafish embryos exposed to diquat for 96 h did not show any significant mortality nor deformity compared to controls. Moreover, there was no difference in the timing of hatch, an indicator of stress, for fish exposed to diquat. To determine whether changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics occurred in early development as a response to diquat exposure, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole embryos. Basal respiration and ATP production were decreased following a 24 h diquat exposure at 100 mu M, suggesting that diquat negatively affects oxidative phosphorylation. We also assessed locomotor behavior as a sensitive endpoint for impaired activity and neurotoxicity. Seven day old (7 dpf) zebrafish treated with diquat at the highest doses tested (10-100 mu M) showed an increase (hyper-activity) in total distance travelled, velocity, movement cumulative duration, and overall activity compared to unexposed fish. Lastly, in 7d fish, we measured transcripts related to redox balance and apoptosis as diquat has been reported to induce oxidative stress and can affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. Larvae exposed to 10 mu M diquat showed higher transcript levels of catalase compared to control fish, implying that reactive oxygen species are produced following diquat exposure. Transcript levels of sod1, sod2, bcl2, bax and caspase 3 however did not vary in abundance among treatments with diquat. This study improves mechanistic understanding of diquat in fish at early stages of development and presents evidence that diquat disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics and behavior.

TI  - DNA Damage and Effects on Glutathione-S-Transferase Activity Induced by Atrazine Exposure in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of atrazine (2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-S-triazine) on the activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and DNA damage in males and females of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish were exposed to control and three treatments (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L) of atrazine for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days. The results indicated that, for males, the GST activity at lower atrazine concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mg/L) was markedly higher than that of the controls throughout the duration of the experiment while there was a significant inhibition of the GST activity at 1 mg/L atrazine at days 5 and 20. For females, a significant increase was detected at 0.1 mg/L on the days 5 and 15 and at 0.01 mg/L on day 20. The DNA damage in zebrafish was evaluated using the comet assay; the olive tail moments obtained for hepatopancreas were enhanced after treatment with different concentrations of atrazine on days 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. The DNA damage increased with increasing atrazine concentrations, indicating that genotoxicity of atrazine and significant differences was found compared to the controls. In conclusion, these findings provide further evidence of the effects of atrazine on aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 26: 480-488, 2011.

TI  - Exposure and post-exposure effects of endosulfan on Bufo bufo tadpoles: Morpho-histological and ultrastructural study on epidermis and iNOS localization
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Endosulfan is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) that has lethal and sublethal effects on non-target organisms, including amphibians. In a laboratory study, we investigated direct and post-exposure effects of endosulfan on Bufo bufo tadpoles. For this purpose we exposed the tadpoles to a single short-term contamination event (96 h) at an environmentally-realistic concentration (200 mu g endosulfan/L). This was followed by a recovery period of 10 days when the experimental animals were kept in pesticide-free water. The endpoints were assessed in terms of mortality, incidence of deformity, effects on behavior, and the morpho-functional features of the epidermis. We found that a short-term exposure to the tested concentration of endosulfan did not cause mortality but induced severe sublethal effects, such as hyperactivity, convulsions, and axis malformations. Following relocation to a pesticide-free environment, we noted two types of response within the experimental sample, in terms of morphological and behavioral traits. Moreover, by using both ultrastructural and a morpho-functional approach, we found that a short-term exposure to endosulfan negatively affected the amphibian epidermis. We also observed several histo-pathological alterations: increased mucous secretion, an increase in intercellular spaces and extensive cell degeneration, together with the induction of an inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Following the post-exposure period, we found large areas of epidermis in which degeneration phenomena were moderate or absent, as well as a further increase in iNOS immunoreactivity. Thus, after 10 days in a free-pesticide environment, the larval epidermis was able to partially replace elements that had been compromised due to a physiological and/or a pathological response to the pesticide. These results highlight the need for both exposure and post-exposure experiments, when attempting to assess pollutant effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Early life exposure of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to synthetic pyrethroids and their metabolites: a comparison of phenotypic and behavioral indicators and gene expression involved in the HPT axis and innate immune system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Ecotoxicological studies have revealed the association between synthetic pyrethroid (SP) exposure and aquatic toxicity in fish; however, research on the toxic effects of SP metabolites is still limited. In this study, the toxicity of two SPs (permethrin (PM) and beta-cypermethrin (beta-CP)) and their three metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic alcohol (PBCOH), 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (PBCHO), and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBCOOH)) towards zebrafish embryos and larvae was evaluated. Both SPs and their metabolites exhibited significant developmental toxicities, caused abnormal vascular development, and changed locomotor activities in larvae. The alteration of gene expression involved in the thyroid system and the innate immune system indicated that SPs and their three metabolites have the potency to induce thyroid disruption and trigger an immune response. The results from the present study suggest that SP metabolites could induce multiple toxic responses similar to parent compounds, and their toxicity should be considered for improving the understanding of environmental risks of SPs.

TI  - Effects of Sevin (carbaryl insecticide) on early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Sevin brand carbaryl insecticide is one of the most commonly used insecticides in the United States, with great potential for leaching into ground- and surface water reserves. Its possible teratogenic effects were tested on zebrafish eggs in four dilutions of decreasing concentration. The average mortality rate was low, indicating that Sevin does not directly kill embryos at these concentrations. Eggs and embryos were consistently smaller than the control starting at 24 h after spawning until hatching. Embryos in the highest concentration took up to twice as long to hatch as the control. This delayed hatching time increases vulnerability to predation. In addition, as minnows are lower on the food chain, bioaccumulation of Sevin in tissues may increase in larger predators, affecting their metabolism and reproduction.

TI  - Endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate disrupts zebrafish embryonic development
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Fish in agricultural and remote areas may be exposed to endosulfan and its degradation products as a result of direct runoff, atmospheric transport and deposition. The following study used the zebrafish developmental model to investigate the responses to endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate, the major degradation product of endosulfan I and II. Embryos were dechorionated and waterborne exposed to the endosulfan I or endosulfan sulfate from 6 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf). Endosulfan I exposure concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 10 mu g/L and endosulfan sulfate from 1 to 100 mu g/L. Water solutions were renewed every 24 h and fish were scored for overt developmental and behavioral abnormalities. Chemical analysis was performed on water, whole embryo, and larvae samples to determine waterborne exposure concentrations and tissue concentrations throughout the 5-day period. The most sensitive toxicity end-point for both endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate was an abnormal response of the embryo/larvae to touch, suggesting that endosulfan I and sulfate are developmentally neurotoxic. The waterborne exposure EC(50)s for inhibition of touch response for endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate were 2.2 mu g/L and 23 mu g/L, respectively. The endosulfans were highly concentrated by the organisms, and the inhibition of touch response tissue EC50, determined from the measured tissue concentrations, was 367 ng/g for endosulfan I and 4552 ng/g for endosulfan sulfate.

TI  - Acute embryonic exposure of zebrafish to permethrin induces behavioral changes related to anxiety and aggressiveness in adulthood
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Permethrin (PM) is one of the most used synthetic pyrethroid worldwide. Exposure to this compound during pregnancy and early childhood has been indicated as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. We evaluated the long-term effects of embryonic PM exposure in different stages of zebrafish development. Briefly, embryos (3 hpf) were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of PM (25 and 50 mu g.L-1) during 24 h and then behavioral parameters were evaluated during embryonic (28 hpf), eleutheroembryonic (3 dpf), larval (7 dpf), and adult stages (90 dpf). PM exposure decreased spontaneous movement at 28 hpf and decreased thigmotaxis in eleutheroembryos. The long-term effects of PM include changes in non-motor behaviors such as fear and anxiety in larva and adults. Adults embryonically exposed to PM also showed a significant increase in aggressiveness parameters. These results demonstrated that embryonic exposure to PM induces persistent neurotoxic effects in adulthood, which can impair the cognitive and behavioral fitness of non-target species contributing to a rise in neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - Assessment of fipronil toxicity to the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius: Molecular, biochemical, and organismal responses
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that entered the market to replace organochlorides and organophosphates. Fipronil impairs the regular inhibition of nerve impulses that ultimately result in paralysis and death of insects. Because of its use as a pest control, and due to runoff events, fipronil has been detected in freshwater systems near agricultural areas, and therefore might represent a threat to non-target aquatic organisms. In this study, the toxicity of fipronil to the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius was investigated at biochemical, molecular, and whole organism (e.g. growth, emergence, and behavior) levels. At the individual level, chronic (28 days) exposure to fipronil resulted in reduced larval growth and emergence with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.081 mu g L-1. Adult weight, which is directly linked to the flying performance and fecundity of midges, was also affected (LOEC = 0.040 mu g L-1). Additionally, behavioral changes such as irregular burrowing behavior of C. riparius larvae (EC50 = 0.084 mu g L-1) and impairment of adult flying performance were observed. At a biochemical level, acute (48 h) exposure to fipronil increased cellular oxygen consumption (as indicated by the increase of electron transport system (ETS) activity) and decreased antioxidant and detoxification defenses (as suggested by the decrease in catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities). Exposure to fipronil also caused alterations in the fatty acid profile of C. riparius, since high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA) were observed. A comparison between exposed and non-exposed larvae also revealed alterations in the expression of globins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and proteins involved in protein biosynthesis. These alterations may aid in the interpretation of potential mechanisms of action that lead to the effects observed at the organism level. Present results show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil are toxic to chironomid populations which call for monitoring of phenylpyrazole insecticides and of their ecological effects in freshwaters. Present results also emphasize the importance of complementing ecotoxicological data with molecular approaches such as proteomics, for a better interpretation of the mode of action of insecticides in aquatic invertebrates.

TI  - Transient exposure to sublethal concentrations of a pesticide mixture (chlorpyrifos-difenoconazole) caused different responses in fish species from different trophic levels of the same community
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The assessment of early effects caused in biota by sublethal exposure to pesticide mixtures should enhance the realism in the ecological risk assessment for agricultural landscapes. This study aimed to evaluate sub-individual responses in fish, which can be linked with outcomes at higher levels of biological organization and affect their trophic relationships. A multilevel biomarker approach was applied to assess the effects of a 48 h exposure of two freshwater mesoamerican fish species (Parachromis dovii and Poecilia gillii) to a mixture of sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos (5 mu g/L) and difenoconazole (325 mu g/L). Transcriptomic induction of cyp1A and the activities of 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-distillase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were measured as biotransformation-related biomarkers; cholinesterase activity (ChE) was assessed as a neumtoxicity biomarker; resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured as a physiological biomarker; and the movement of fish in a dark-light environment as a behavior biomarker. The exposure to the mixture had evident effects on P. gillii, with significant induction of cyp1A transcription, increased EROD activity, ChE inhibition in muscle, and increased permanence in the light side of the dark-light environment. Meanwhile, P. dovii only showed significant induction of cyp1A, without evidence of neurotoxicity or changes in behavior. This study demonstrates that the severity of the effects caused by the exposure to a mixture of pesticides can differ among species from the same trophic chain. The potential impairment of predator-prey relationships is a relevant effect that pesticide pollution can cause and it should be considered for the risk assessment of such contaminants.

TI  - Imidacloprid induces adverse effects on fish early life stages that are more severe in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) than in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Neonicotinoids are widely used insecticides that have frequently been found in freshwater with concentrations ranging from ng to mu g/L. It is known that these compounds impact non-target invertebrates, such as bees and gammaridae, in terms of toxicity and behavior, but impacts and species differences on vertebrates such as fish are little explored. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of one widely used neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on development and behavior of two fish model species: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Fish were exposed for 5 (zebrafish) and 14 (medaka) days from 0.2 to 2000 mu g/L. imidacloprid by aqueous exposure. Survival, development, behavior and histological features were monitored and organism-internal concentrations and biotransformation products measured. Imidacloprid caused sublethal effects in both species but the effects were much stronger in medaka with deformities, lesions and reduced growth being the most prominent impacts. Due to the overall longer time of development, time-integrated exposure of medaka was about 2-fold higher compared to zebrafish, potentially accounting for parts of the sensitivity differences. Our results underline the importance of taking species sensitivity differences into account especially when considering that medaka responded at imidacloprid concentrations that have been measured in the environment.

TI  - Enantioselectivity of toxicological responses induced by maternal exposure of cis-bifenthrin enantiomers in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae.
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The maternal transfer and developmental toxicity of chiral contaminants with respect to enantioselectivity have rarely been investigated. Here, the residues and toxicological responses of cis-BF, a typical chiral pesticide, were studied in the progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to cis-BF (0, 20, 100, and 500 ng/L) for 60 days. Cis-BF enantiomers exhibited the equal maternal transfer potentials. GC/MSD analysis showed that parental 1S-cis-BF exposure could disrupt the components of fatty acids in offspring embryos. In transcriptional expression, the whole differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in GO categories, including the processes related to lipid biosynthesis/metabolism. The perturbations of fatty acids suggested that cis-BF has potential negative impacts on embryos' development. Furthermore, enantioselective growth inhibition and developmental neurotoxicity in larvae were also observed. The mRNA expressions of neuronal development genes were significantly changed in 1S-exposed offspring, so were the levels of the neurotransmitters and larval locomotion. Our results show that the cis-BF induced the growth inhibition and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae, which may be mediated by the development interference in embryos related to the disrupted fatty acid composition. Furthermore, the toxicological response to 1S-cis-BF was greater than that to the 1R-enantiomer in the offspring of exposed adults.

TI  - A sensitive biomarker for the detection of aquatic contamination based on behavioral assays using zebrafish larvae
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - An effective biological early warning system for the detection of water contamination should employ undemanding species that rapidly react to the presence of contaminants in their environment The demonstrated reaction should be comprehensible and unambiguously evidential of the contamination event. This study utilized 96 h post fertilization zebrafish larvae and tested their behavioral response to acute exposure to low concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) (5.0, 2.5,125, 0.625 mg/L) and permethrin (0.05, 0.029, 0.017, 0.01 mu g/L). We hypothesize that the number of larvae that show advanced trajectories in a group corresponds with water contamination, as the latter triggers avoidance behavior in the organisms. The proportion of advanced trajectories in the control and treated groups during the first minute of darkness was designated as a segregation parameter. It was parametrized and a threshold value was set using one CdCl2 trial and then applied to the remaining CdCl2 and permethrin replicates. For all cases, the method allowed distinguishing between the control and treated groups within two cycles of light: dark. The calculated parameter was statistically significantly different between the treated and control groups, except for the lowest CdCl2 concentration (0.625 mg/L) in one replicate. This proof of-concept study shows the potential of the proposed methodology for utilization as part of a multi species biomonitoring system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Embryonic atrazine exposure and later in life behavioral and brain transcriptomic, epigenetic, and pathological alterations in adult male zebrafish
T2  - CELL BIOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ), a commonly used pesticide linked to endocrine disruption, cancer, and altered neurochemistry, frequently contaminates water sources at levels above the US Environmental Protection Agency's 3 parts per billion (ppb; mu g/L) maximum contaminant level. Adult male zebrafish behavior, brain transcriptome, brain methylation status, and neuropathology were examined to test the hypothesis that embryonic ATZ exposure causes delayed neurotoxicity, according to the developmental origins of health and disease paradigm. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 0 ppb, 0.3 ppb, 3 ppb, or 30 ppb ATZ during embryogenesis (1-72 h post fertilization (hpf)), then rinsed and raised to maturity. At 9 months post fertilization (mpf), males had decreased locomotor parameters during a battery of behavioral tests. Transcriptomic analysis identified altered gene expression in organismal development, cancer, and nervous and reproductive system development and function pathways and networks. The brain was evaluated histopathologically for morphometric differences, and decreased numbers of cells were identified in raphe populations. Global methylation levels were evaluated at 12 mpf, and the body length, body weight, and brain weight were measured at 14 mpf to evaluate effects of ATZ on mature brain size. No significant difference in genome methylation or brain size was observed. The results demonstrate that developmental exposure to ATZ does affect neurodevelopment and neural function in adult male zebrafish and raises concern for possible health effects in humans due to ATZ's environmental presence and persistence.

TI  - Behavioural and developmental toxicity of chlorpyrifos and nickel chloride to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - In order to assess the combined toxicity of environmental chemicals with different modes of action in acute (2 h) and subchronic (11 d) exposures, embryos and larvae of Danio rerio were exposed to a heavy metal salt, nickel chloride (NiCl(2)) the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CHP) and their binary mixtures. Chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, which is likely to affect behaviour of the organism. NiCl(2) targets the active sites of enzymes and is regarded as an unspecific toxicant for aquatic organisms. Several endpoints, such as locomotor activity, morphological abnormalities, and mortality of D. rerio embryos and larvae were studied. During acute exposures to >= 0.25 mg/L of chlorpyrifos, locomotor activity tended to increase. However, this activity decreased significantly at >= 7.5 mg Ni/L. Subchronic exposures to CHP resulted in behavioural changes at much lower concentrations (>= 0.01 mg/L) and considerably earlier than the observed increase in morphological abnormalities and mortality (LC(50) (10 d): 0.43 mg/L). Combined CHP and NiCl(2) Mixtures led to an antagonistic deviation from the concept of independent action, in the case of locomotor activity. Compared to developmental or survival parameters, behaviour was the most sensitive endpoint for CHP exposure in this study; therefore we recommend this parameter to complement already established endpoints.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of the triazole fungicide cyproconazole in embryo-larval stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Cyproconazole is a triazole fungicide used to protect a diverse range of fruits, vegetables, and grain crops. As such, it has the potential to enter aquatic environments and affect non-target organisms. The objective of this study was to assess the acute toxicity of the triazole fungicide cyproconazole to zebrafish embryos by assessing mortality, developmental defects, morphological abnormality, oxidative respiration, and locomotor activity following a 96-h exposure. Zebrafish embryos at 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either a solvent control (0.1% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mu M cyproconazole for 96 h. Data indicated that cyproconazole exhibited low toxicity to zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC50 value of 90.6 mu M ( 26.4 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos/larvae displayed a significant decrease in spontaneous movement, hatching rate, and heartbeats/20 s with 50, 100, and 250 mu M cyproconazole exposure. Malformations (i.e., pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail deformation, and spine deformation) were also detected in zebrafish exposed to ae<yen> 50 mu M cyproconazole, with significant increases in cumulative deformity rate at 48, 72, and 96 hpf. In addition, a 20-30% decrease in basal and oligomycin-induced ATP respiration was observed after 24-h exposure to 500 mu M cyproconazole in embryos. To determine if cyproconazole affected locomotor activity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae following 7-day exposure to 1, 10, and 25 mu M cyproconazole in two independent trials. Activity in the dark period was decreased for zebrafish exposed to 25 mu M cyproconazole in the first trial, and hypoactivity was also observed in zebrafish exposed to 1 mu M cyproconazole in a second trial, suggesting that cyproconazole can affect locomotor activity. These data improve understanding of the toxicity of cyproconazole in developing zebrafish and contribute to environmental risk assessments for the triazole fungicides on aquatic organisms. We report that, based on the overall endpoints assessed, cyproconazole exhibits low risk for developing fish embryos, as many effects were observed above environmentally-relevant levels.

TI  - Behavioral effects in adult zebrafish after developmental exposure to carbaryl
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations. Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption responsible for the effects observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The organophosphate insecticide diazinon and aging: Neurobehavioral and mitochondrial effects in zebrafish exposed as embryos or during aging
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Organophosphate (OP) compounds comprise one of the most widely used classes of insecticides worldwide. OPs have been shown to have negative human health impacts, particularly developmental neurotoxicity. However, neurotoxic impacts in later adulthood and during the aging process are relatively uncharacterized. The present study examined diazinon (DZN), an OP, to determine the neurobehavioral consequences, in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction on a macroscale (whole organism basal respiration) and on a microscale (whole organ mitochondrial respiration), using zebrafish (ZF) as a model. One group of 14-month-old adult ZF were exposed acutely as adults (0.4, 1.25, and 4.0 mu M) for five days and tested as adults, and another group was exposed developmentally 5-120 h post-fertilization (70, 210, and 700 nM) and tested at larval, adolescent, adult, and aging life stages. ZF exposed acutely as adults did not display many significant neurobehavioral impacts or mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the embryonically exposed ZF showed altered behavioral functions at each stage of life which emerged and attenuated as fish transitioned from each developmental stage to the next. Mitochondrial oxygen consumptions measurement results for developmentally DZN exposed ZF showed significant increases in the low and middle dose groups in organs such as the brain and testes. Overall, there is an indication that early developmental exposure to DZN had continuing adverse neurobehavioral and cellular consequences throughout their lives well into adulthood and aging periods.

TI  - Toxicomorphomics and toxicokinetics of quinalphos on embryonic development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and its binding affinity towards hatching enzyme, ZHE1
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - This study outlines the toxic effects of Quinalphos (QP), an organophosphrous insecticide on the development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, with special emphasis on toxicomorphomics and toxicokinetics of target enzyme, AChE. A range of concentrations was used to elucidate the median lethal concentration (LC50) of Quinalphos. Furthermore, embryos were exposed to two sub-lethal concentrations LC10 (0.66 mg/L) and LC20 (1.12 mg/L) along with a median lethal concentration (3.0 mg/L) for 96 h. Several morphological aberrations like lordosis, kyphosis, scoliosis, heart edema, breaks in the neuronal tube and underdeveloped facial parts were noticed, which were of concentration and time dependent. The QP has adequately hindered hatching process during the course of exposure which was upheld by the in silico docking studies with hatching enzyme, ZHE1. The length of hatchlings at 96 h in LC50 concentration was significantly reduced to 47% compared to control. A significant pericardial effusion (5 to 16 fold) was observed in >90% of LC50 treated groups. Morphological changes in heart lead to the bradycardia, which ultimately leading to heart failure in some cases. The swimming behavior was significantly diminished in relation to the inhibition of AChE levels. From the in vitro kinetic studies, the kinetic constants Km, Vmax and inhibitory concentration K-i (4.45 x 10(-5) M) was determined which supported the competitive nature of QP.

TI  - Compound pesticide controlled release system based on the mixture of poly(butylene succinate) and PLA.
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROENCAPSULATION
AB  - Controlled release system has been widely developed and utilised in agriculture to optimise efficacy and minimise environmental pollution. Here, the azoxystrobin and difenoconazole compound pesticide microsphere was constructed by the solvent evaporation method. Blending poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) as shells, in order to increase its entrapment efficiency and match the goal of complex synergism. The resulting microsphere processes high entrapment efficiency with a mean diameter of 7.2 μm. Acute toxicity suggested microsphere on zebrafish was moderate toxicity. Comparative studies revealed that the microsphere had a longer period of sustained release than difenoconazole-azoxystrobin (5:8) 32.5% w/v suspension concentrate (SC). In addition, the concentration ratio of active ingredients closed to the optimum compound stoichiometry, which can achieve the objective of improving the efficacy of the pesticides. These results demonstrated that such a compound pesticide microsphere delivery system may be a considerable potential for further exploration.

TI  - Environmental stressors and neurobiological features of marine teleosts: Histamine receptors as targets
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB  - The excessive levels of aquatic endocrine disruptors (EDs) and namely heavy metals plus xenoestrogens account for irregular gas exchange processes, reduced reproductive success, as well as abnormal social interactions of marine teleost fish. These effects at the encephalic level appear to derive from the interference of major signaling factors such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor subtypes (H1-4R). HA is one of the main biogenic amine neuronal system responsible for regulatory homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms and motor activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how they are capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor subtypes. Interestingly, subtype 2 (H2R) proved to be a preferential target of heavy metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as displayed by its specific antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et al., 2003, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the preferential H3R antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfer with normal swimming behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 227:248-256). In the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan, their actions tend to mostly account for feeding alterations through hypothalamic H3R-dependent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to highlight the type of ED-HAergic neuroreceptor variations that are involved in stressor-dependent neurobehavioral responses of commercially valuable marine teleosts.

TI  - Developmental toxicity in embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to strobilurin fungicides (azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin are broad spectrum strobilurin fungicides that have been measured in the aquatic environment. Strobilurins inhibit mitochondrial respiration by binding to the mitochondrial respiratory complex Ill. The goal of this study was to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the developing zebrafish from exposure to azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin. Exposure studies were performed where zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin at 0.1, 10, 100 mu g/L from 4 hpf to 48 hpf to measure mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress mRNA transcripts, and 5 dpf to measure movement, growth, oxygen consumption, enzymatic activities, and mRNA transcripts. Results from this study indicated that there was a significant reduction in both basal and maximal respiration at 48 hpf in zebrafish exposed to 100 mu g/L of pyraclostrobin. There was no difference in oxidative stress or apoptotic mRNA transcripts at 48 hpf, indicating that the two strobilurins were acting first on mitochondrial function and not directly through oxidative stress. At 5 dpf, standard body length was significantly reduced with exposure to pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin exposure as compared to the control. These reductions in apical endpoints corresponded with increases in oxidative stress and apoptotic mRNA transcripts in treatment groups at 5 dpf indicating that strobilurins' exposure followed the adverse outcome pathway for mito-toxicants. Our results indicate that strobilurins can decrease mitochondrial function, which in turn lead to diminished growth and movement. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is sodium percarbonate a good choice in situ remediation of deltamethrin pollution?
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB  - In this research, the toxic effects of deltamethrin (DM) on the behavior responses of Zebra fish (Danio rerio) in the characteristic of behavior strength were investigated followed by an assessment of an in situ remediation of the DM pollution using sodium percarbonate. Behavior strength of Danio rerio was approximately 0.83 in the control group and was slightly higher than 0.83 in the sublethal treatment (0.1 TU (toxic unit)), which suggested that sublethal DM exposure could induce a stimulation effect in 48 h of exposure. In lower DM concentration treatments (0.5 and 1.0 TU), behavior strength could be inhibited significantly. Behavior responses of Danio rerio showed a gradually increased tendency when they were exposed to higher concentration of DM, and the declining amplitudes of behavior strength changed with the increase of DM concentrations. These results suggested that DM had evident acute toxicity effects on the behavior responses of Danio rerio with a good dose-effect relationship. The in situ remediation of the DM pollution using sodium percarbonate showed that the toxic effect of DM on behavior responses of Danio rerio could be eliminated even in the highest concentration of DM (5.0 TU). Meanwhile, the behavior response of Danio rerio in the treatment of sodium percarbonate was the same as in the control, which indicated that sodium percarbonate had no evident toxic effects on the behavior of Danio rerio in the current concentration. This study suggested that adding sodium percarbonate in situ might be a good way to eliminate the DM toxic effects. (C) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017

TI  - Antagonistic effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior and oxidative stress induced by toxic metals and deltamethrin acute exposure
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In natural environments, the aquatic organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals which may originate from natural sources or from anthropogenic activities. In this context, the aim of the study was to assess the potential effects that might occur when aquatic organisms are simultaneously exposed to multiple chemicals. For that, we have studied the acute effects of cadmium (0.2 mu g L-1), nickel (10 mu g L-1) and deltamethrin (2 mu g L-1) as individual toxicants and as mixture on the behavioral responses, oxidative stress (SOD and GPx), body electrolytes and trace metals profiles of zebrafish (Danio rerio). So far the scientific literature did not report about the combined effects of pesticides and toxic metals on zebrafish behavior using a 3D tracking system. Compared with other studies, in the present paper we investigated the acute effects of two heavy metals associated with a pesticide on zebrafish, in the range of environmentally relevant concentrations. Thus, the environmental concentrations of cadmium and nickel in three rivers affected by urban activities and one river with protected areas as background control were measured. The observations that resulted in our study demonstrated that del tamethrin toxicity was significantly decreased in some of the behavioral variables and oxidative stress when combined with Cd-Ni mixture. Consequently, our study supports previous works concerning the combined toxicity of environmental chemicals since their simultaneous presence in the aqueous environment may lead to higher or lower toxicological effects on biota than those reported from a single pollutant. Therefore, the evaluation of toxic effects of a single contaminant does not offer a realistic estimate of its impact against aqueous ecosystems This study also supports the idea that the interactions between different chemical compounds which do not exceed the maximum permitted limits in environment may have benefits for aquatic life forms or be more toxic.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES
AB  - The neurotoxic effects attributed to the pesticide fenvalerate (FEN) are well-established. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin (MLT) was able to protect against FEN-induced behavior, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neurogenesis using zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Zebrafish exposed to 100 mu g/L FEN for 120 h exhibited decreased swimming activity accompanied by downregulated expression of neurogenesis-related genes (Dlx2, Shha, Ngn1, Elavl3, and Gfap), suggesting that neurogenesis were impaired. In addition, FEN exposure significantly elevated oxidative stress as evidenced by increased malondialdehyde levels, as well as activities of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Acridine orange staining demonstrated that embryos treated with FEN for 120 h significantly enhanced apoptosis mainly in the brain. FEN also produced upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes (Bax, Fas, caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3) and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. MLT significantly attenuated the FEN-mediated oxidative stress, modulated apoptotic-regulating genes, and diminished apoptotic responses. Further, MLT blocked the FEN-induced effects on swimming behavior as well as on neurogenesis-related genes. In conclusion, MLT protected against FEN-induced developmental neurotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibiting pesticide-mediated oxidative stress in zebrafish.

TI  - Mortality, Spatial Avoidance and Swimming Behavior of Bullfrog Tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) Exposed to the Herbicide Diuron
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Diuron is a widely used pesticide for weed control in Brazil, Australia, the USA, and EU; therefore, environmental consequences are of concern. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential toxic effects of diuron (as formulation Diuron Nortox (R) 500 SC) on tadpoles of the bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus, considering three endpoints: lethality, swimming behavior, and avoidance (ability to escape from contaminant). Secondly, it was intended to compare the sensitivity of tadpoles with to fish and other amphibian species by applying species sensitive distribution (SSD). Five diuron concentrations (20, 30, 35, 40, and 45mg a.i./L) were tested in triplicate to evaluate mortality, swimming speed, and distance traveled after 96h of exposure to the herbicide. Two avoidance tests were conducted using a multicompartmented system (n=6) containing three tadpoles per compartment. Dilution gradients were established at 0; 5; 25; 50; 75; and 100% for both systems, corresponding to 0; 0.5; 2.5; 5; 7.5; and 10mg a.i./L in an experiment, taking into account the results of the acute toxicity test and 0; 5; 25; 50; 100; and 150g a.i./L for another experiment, considering reported environmentally relevant concentrations in Brazilian water bodies. The acute toxicity tests (n=3) with diuron revealed an 96h-LC50 of 31 +/- 3.7mg a.i./L. The decreased maximum speed was only observed in tadpoles exposed to 30mg a.i./L (0.15 +/- 0.04m/s) when compared to the control (0.28 +/- 0.06m/s). In the avoidance tests, concentrations of 2.5 and 5mg a.i./L caused the escape behavior of L. catesbeianus tadpoles. However, tadpoles were also able to avoid diuron contamination at environmental relevance, especially in concentrations of 25 and 50g a.i./L. As expected, avoidance and effects on swimming behavior ocurred at lower diuron concentrations than mortality. Sublethal diuron concentrations may thus lead to the displacement of organisms to more favorable areas when they are available and the ability to swim is not affected.

AB  - Triadimefon (TDF) is a triazole fungicide extensively used in agriculture that has been found as a pollutant in numerous water sources. In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.

TI  - Low-dose cadmium affects the enantioselective bioaccumulation and dissipation of chiral penflufen in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Pesticides are currently extensively used in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and environmental hygiene, and their residues have become a global environmental problem, which can easily form combined pollution with heavy metals. The present study examined the effects of chronic (28 days) aqueous exposure of chiral penflufen (rac-penflufen, R-(-)-penflufen and S-(+)-penflufen), a widely used fungicide, with/without cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic heavy metal in zebrafish (Danio rerio). After rac-penflufen individual or combined exposure with Cd, the bioaccumulation and residual levels of S-(+)-penflufen were significantly higher than R-(-)-penflufen, and the effects of Cd were insignificantly. But for penflufen enantiomer, the effects of Cd were more serious for R- (-)-penflufen, which could increase the bioaccumulation (up to1.73 times), inhibit the dissipation (up to 32.3%) and enhance the residue (up to 5.35 times) of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, decreasing the enantioselectivity. However, significant increase of S-(+)-penflufen concentrations was only found in viscera under co-exposure of Cd. The tissue distribution of penflufen enantiomers were not affected by the presence of Cd, and no intercon-version of the two enantiomers occurred regardless of the presence of Cd. These findings indicated that co-contamination with Cd could increase the persistence of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, thus increasing the environmental risks. The significant differences of Cd effects on chiral pesticide enantiomer and racemate indicated that the combined pollution of heavy metal and chiral pesticide might have enantiomer-specific, which should raise concern, and the enantioselective mechanism deserve further study.

TI  - Molecular networks related to the immune system and mitochondria are targets for the pesticide dieldrin in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system (CNS) following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. Zebrafish were fed pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8 mu g/g dieldrin for 21 days. Behavioral analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin, consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative diseases. Biological significance: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration. These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework for pesticide induced neurotoxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Differential impact of dose-range glyphosate on locomotor behavior, neuronal activity, glio-cerebrovascular structures, and transcript regulations in zebrafish larvae
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The presence of glyphosate represents a debated ecotoxicological and health risk factor. Here, zebrafish larvae were exposed, from 1.5 to 120 h post-fertilization, to a broad concentration range (0.05 -10.000 mu g/L) of glyphosate to explore its impact on the brain. We evaluated morphology, tracked locomotor behavior and neurophysiological parameters, examined neuro-glio-vascular cell structures, and outlined transcriptomic outcomes by RNA sequencing. At the concentration range tested, glyphosate did not elicit gross morphological changes. Behavioral analysis revealed a significant decrease in locomotor activity following the exposure to 1000 mu g/L glyphosate or higher. In parallel, midbrain electrophysiological recordings indicated abnormal, and variable, spike activity in zebrafish larvae exposed to 1000 mu g/L glyphosate. Next, we asked whether the observed neurophysiological outcome could be secondary to brain structural modifications. We used transgenic zebrafish and in vivo 2-photon microscopy to examine, at the cellular level, the effects of the behavior-modifying concentration of 1000 mu g/L, comparing to low 0.1 mu g/L, and control. We ruled out the presence of cerebrovascular and neuronal malformations. However, microglia morphological modifications were visible at the two glyphosate concentrations, specifically the presence of amoeboid cells suggestive of activation. Lastly, RNAseq analysis showed the deregulation of transcript families implicated in neuronal physiology, synaptic transmission, and inflammation, as evaluated at the two selected glyphosate concentrations. In zebrafish larvae, behavioral and neurophysiological defects occur after the exposure to high glyphosate concentrations while cellular and transcript signatures can be detected in response to low dose. The prospective applicability to ecotoxicology and the possible extension to brain-health vulnerability are critically discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing Anti‐Social and Aggressive Behavior in a Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Model of Parkinson’s Disease Chronically Exposed to Rotenone
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Rotenone (ROT) is currently being used in various research fields, especially neuroscience. Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson’s disease (PD)‐related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochon-dria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(ag-onists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 μg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5 mg/mL, anti‐parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti‐social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups—(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA—displayed an impaired, often anti-thetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT‐treated zebrafish (e—h). Independently of the aggressive‐like reac-tions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB. © by the authors.

TI  - A meta-analysis synthesizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Pesticide contaminants are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose a threat to biodiversity. Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35%, and reduced overall activity by 72%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - ACUTE TOXICITY OF HERBICIDES DIURON AND HEXAZINONE TO Danio rerio
T2  - PESTICIDAS-REVISTA DE ECOTOXICOLOGIA E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of a commercial herbicide extensively used in sugarcane cultivation, composed of diuron, hexazinone and inert ingredients using Danio rerio as test organism. Laboratory tests were performed according to the recommendations of the ABNT 15088 (2004) and USEPA (2002) standards. The water control parameters were pH, total water hardness, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature, swimming activity and mortality of the test organism. The lethal concentration (LC50) of the commercial herbicide for Danio rerio was of 581.50mg.L-1. Significant behavioral changes were observed at concentrations starting from 50 mg.L-1 of the commercial herbicide, causing hypoactivity of swimming movements in over 50% of the test organisms. To evaluate the toxicity of the inert ingredients, which account for 40% p/p of the herbicide's composition, the compounds hexazinone and diuron were tested separately. At the studied concentrations, hexazinone and diuron did not cause mortality or altered swimming movements. It was concluded that the inert ingredients in the composition of the commercial herbicide were the major cause for acute toxicity to Danio rerio.

TI  - Chitosan nanoparticles containing the insecticide dimethoate: A new approach in the reduction of harmful ecotoxicological effects
T2  - NANOIMPACT
AB  - Organophosphate insecticides such as dimethoate (DMT) are widely used in agriculture. As a side effect, however, these insecticides contaminate bodies of water, resulting in damage to aquatic organisms. The development of nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the control of agricultural pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing their toxicological effects. Based upon this, the present study has investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate chitosan nanoparticles (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on non-target organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM, as well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity was also evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT (NP + DMT), and commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and larvae of Danio rerio (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology, and behavior. The nanoparticle control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size values of 283 +/- 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 +/- 0.05 and a zeta potential of -31 +/- 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate, the nanoparticles showed 301 +/- 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 +/- 0.02, a zeta potential of -27.9 +/- 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 +/- 0.32%, with slow-release overtime (52% after 48 h). The AFM images showed that both types of nanoparticles showed spherical morphology. Major toxic effects on embryo larval development were observed in commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the technical pesticide, predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With regard to the toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an increase for LC50-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior of the larvae was not affected. The data obtained demonstrate that nanoencapsulated dimethoate reduces the toxicity of insecticides on zebrafish larvae, suggesting that nanoencapsulation may be safer for non-target species, by eliminating collateral effects and thus promoting sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Developmental Exposure to Organophosphate Flame Retardants Elicits Overt Toxicity and Alters Behavior in Early Life Stage Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are common replacements for the phased-out polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and have been detected at high concentrations in environmental samples. OPFRs are structurally similar to organophosphate pesticides and may adversely affect the developing nervous system. This study evaluated the overt toxicity, uptake, and neurobehavioral effects of tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP) in early life stage zebrafish. Chlorpyrifos was used as a positive control. For overt toxicity and neurobehavioral assessments, zebrafish were exposed from 0 to 5 days postfertilization (dpf). Hatching, death, or malformations were evaluated daily. Teratogenic effects were scored by visual examination on 6 dpf. To evaluate uptake and metabolism, zebrafish were exposed to 1 mu M of each organophosphate (OP) flame retardant and collected on 1 and 5 dpf to monitor accumulation. Larval swimming activity was measured in 6 dpf larvae to evaluate neurobehavioral effects of exposures below the acute toxicity threshold. TDBPP elicited the greatest toxicity at >1 mu M. TDCPP and chlorpyrifos were overtly toxic at concentrations >= 10 mu M, TCEP, and TCPP were not overtly toxic at the doses tested. Tissue concentrations increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the parent chemical after 24h exposures. TDCPP and TDBPP and their respective metabolites were detected in embryos on 5 dpf. For all chemicals tested, developmental exposures that were not overtly toxic significantly altered larval swimming activity. These data indicate that OPFRs adversely affect development of early life stage zebrafish.

TI  - Biological impacts of glyphosate on morphology, embryo biomechanics and larval behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - All of these days, residues of herbicides such as glyphosate are widely distributed in the environment. The ubiquitous use of glyphosate has drawn extensive attention to its toxicity as an organic pollutant. In this study, we employed larval zebrafish as an animal model to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of glyphosate on early development via morphological, biomechanics, behavioral and physiological analyses. Morphological results showed that an obvious delay occurred in the epiboly process and body length, eye and head area were reduced at concentrations higher than 10 mg/L. The expression of ntl (no tail) shortened and krox20 (also known as Egr2b, early growth response 2b) changed as the glyphosate concentration increased, but there was no change in the expression of shh (sonic hedgehog). In addition, biomechanical analysis of the elasticity of chorion indicated that treated embryos' surface tension was declined. Furthermore, a 48-h locomotion test revealed that embryonic exposure to glyphosate significantly elevated locomotor activities, which is probably attributed to motoneuronal damage. The decreased surface tension of chorion and the increased locomotive activities may contribute to the hatching rates after glyphosate treatment. Our study enriches the researches of evaluating glyphosate toxicity and probablely plays a warning role in herbicides used in farming. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Herbicides diuron and fluazifop-p-butyl affect avoidance response and multixenobiotic resistance activity in earthworm Eisenia andrei
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The usage of pesticides has been steadily increasing over the last decades, and among them herbicides are the most commonly used ones. Despite their main mode of action targeting plant organisms, they can also have adverse effects on non-target animal organisms. In soil ecosystems, earthworms play an important role due to their positive impacts on the soil functioning and they represent good model organisms in soil ecotoxicology. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of two herbicides on several endpoints at different levels of biological organization in the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Diuron and fivazifop-p-butyl were selected for the investigation and their lethal concentrations were determined: LC50 48 h: 89.087 mu g/cm(2) for diuron and 6.167 mu g/cm(2) for fluazifop-p-butyl. Furthermore, measurements of enzymatic biomarkers (catalase (CAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)), multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity and gene expression of antioxidative enzymes (only for fluazifop-p-butyl) were conducted. Enzymatic biomarker responses showed no significant differences compared to the control after the exposure to the investigated herbicides, whereas the MXR activity was significantly inhibited. The gene expression level of superoxide dismutase (sod) and glutathione S-transferase (gst) after fivazifop-p-butyl exposure showed a significant increase. Finally, avoidance behavior in soil was assessed and it was determined that both herbicides caused significant avoidance response. The obtained results show that both investigated herbicides significantly affect earthworms on different levels of biological organization. This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive ecotoxicological assessment of herbicide effects on non-target organisms at all organizational levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Toxicity and fate of chiral insecticide pyriproxyfen and its metabolites in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analogue insecticide used worldwide. At present, the potential threat of pyriproxyfen to aquatic organism has not been well explored. In this work, the bioaccumulation, metabolic profile and toxicity of pyriproxyfen and its metabolites to zebrafish were studied, and the enantioselectivity of pyriproxyfen and the major chiral metabolites were also determined. Sixteen metabolites of pyriproxyfen in zebrafish were identified. Hydroxylation, ether linkage cleavage and oxidation in phase I metabolism, followed by sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation. The bioconcentration factors ranged from 1175 to 1246. Hydroxylation metabolites of pyriproxyfen showed enantioselective behavior in zebrafish with enantiomer fractions (EFs) of 4'-OH- pyriproxyfen and 5 `'-OH- pyriproxyfen ranged from 0.50 to 0.71. Toxicological indexes including acute toxicity, joint toxicity and oxidative stress were tested. Among all the metabolites, 4'-OH- pyriproxyfen was found 2 folds more toxic to zebrafish than pyriproxyfen. (-)-Pyriproxyfen was found 2 folds more toxic than rac- and (+)-pyriproxyfen. Antagonistic effects were found in binary joint toxicity of pyriproxyfen and its hydroxylated metabolites. Pyriproxyfen and its metabolites also showed oxidative stress damage by inhibiting the activity of CAT and SOD and increasing MDA. This work provided deep insight into the metabolism and the potential risks of pyriproxyfen to aquatic organisms. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Chronic bisphenol A exposure alters behaviors of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - The adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to treated-effluent concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) for 6 months to evaluate their effects on behavioral characteristics: motor behavior, aggression, group preference, novel tank test and light/dark preference. E2 exposure evidently dampened fish locomotor activity, while BPA exposure had no marked effect. Interestingly, BPA-exposed fish reduced their aggressive behavior compared with control or E2. Both BPA and E2 exposure induced a significant decrease in group preference, as well as a weaker adaptability to new environment, exhibiting lower latency to reach the top, more entries to the top, longer time spent in the top, fewer frequent freezing, and fewer erratic movements. Furthermore, the circadian rhythmicity of light/dark preference was altered by either BPA or E2 exposure. Our results suggest that chronic exposure of treated-effluent concentration BPA or E2 induced various behavioral anomalies in adult fish and enhanced ecological risk to wildlife.

TI  - Toxic responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to thallium and deltamethrin characterized in the electrocardiogram
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used to objectively address the physical condition as an index of stress. Though a numerous accounts of investigations on aquatic organisms' ECGs have been made, differentiation of ECG parameters in responding to specific toxic chemicals has not been extensively studied. In this research, it is hypothesized that zebrafish (Danio rerio) ECG parameters would differently respond to different types of pollutants, a heavy metal, thallium (TI, 0.10 and 13.00 mu g/L) and an organic chemical, deltamethrin (DM, 0.52 and 2.00 mu g/L). Based on the SOM training and statistical analyses, QRS complex could be specified as an indicator of TI stress, while QT interval might be used to evaluate DM stress. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that QRS complex and QT interval were significantly associated with TI stress (r = 0.854, p = 0.0002) and DM stress (r= 0.792, p = 0.001), respectively. QRS complex and QT interval had the highest R-2, the minimum of SSE and the lowest AIC value in TI and DM treatments, respectively. Bases on the current experimental results and previous reports, QRS complex and QT interval could be considered as a specific indicator of TI and DM disturbances in the environment, respectively.

TI  - Effect of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the bioavailability and neurotoxicity of cypermethrin in zebrafish larvae
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - In aquatic environment, the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) has been reported to modify the bioavailability and toxicity of the organic toxicants. Nevertheless, the combined toxicity of NPs and the pesticides that were used world-widely still remains unclear. Cypermethrin (CYP), a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is commonly used for controlling agricultural and indoor pests. Therefore, the effects of titanium dioxide NPs (nTiO(2)) on CYP bio-concentration and its effects on the neuronal development in zebrafish were investigated in our study. Zebrafish embryos (2-hour-post-fertilization, hpf) were exposed to CYP (0, 0.4, 2 and 10 mu g/L) alone or co-exposed with nTiO(2) (1 mg/L) until 120-hpf. nTiO(2) is taken up by zebrafish larvae and also it can adsorb CYP. The zebrafish body burdens of CYP was observed and CYP uptake was increased by nTiO(2), indicating that the nTiO(2) could accelerate the bioaccumulation of CYP in larvae. Co-exposure of nTiO(2) and CYP induced the generation of reactive oxygen species. Exposure to CYP alone significantly decreased the mRNA expression of genes, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), alpha 1-tubulin, myelin basic protein (mbp) and growth associated protein (gap-43). Besides, reductions of serotonin, dopamine and GABA concentrations were observed in zebrafish and the larval locomotion was significantly decreased in response to the lower level of the neurotransmitters. Moreover, co-exposure of nTiO(2) and CYP caused further significantly decreased in the locomotion activity, and enhanced the down-regulation of the mRNA expression of specific genes and the neurotransmitters levels. The results demonstrated that nTiO(2) increased CYP accumulation and enhanced CYP-induced developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish.

TI  - A metabolomic study of fipronil for the anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish larvae at environmentally relevant levels
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Field residue of fipronil can interfere with the physiological characters of the domesticated fish; thus, lethal dose test and the general biomarker cannot delineate the low-level situation. Manipulating by video track, we observed an anxiety-like behavior including high speed and abnormal photoperiod accommodation after exposure to fipronil at environmental typical dose in zebrafish larvae. Examining the unbiased metabolomic profiles, we found perturbation in several metabolic pathways, including the increased contents of fatty acids and glycerol and the decreased levels of the glycine, serine, and branched amino acid. We presumed that observed enhanced fatty acid utility was in response to increase energy demands caused by anxiety like behavior. Additionally, the body burden of neurotransmitter such as glycine and L-glutamate may concurrently stimulate the swimming behavior. The insight of this study showed that integral perturbation such as metabolism helps us to further understand the risk to aquatic fish at the environmentally relevant levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Environmental Impact of Pharmaceutical Pollutants: Synergistic Toxicity of Ivermectin and Cypermethrin
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Veterinary antiparasitic pharmaceuticals as well as pesticides have been detected in surface waters, and they may cause several toxic effects in this environmental compartment. In the present study, we evaluated the toxicity after exposure of different concentration of ivermectin (IVM; 50, 100, and 200 mu g L-1) and cypermethrin (CYP; 5, 10, and 25 mu g L-1) and the combination of these two compounds at non-toxic concentration (IVM 100 + CYP 5 mu g L-1) in zebrafish embryos. Combination of IVM at 100 mu g L-1 with CYP at 5 mu g L-1 exposure induced hatching delay and malformations at 96 hpf in zebrafish larvae as well as significant induction of cell death in zebrafish larvae. At the same time, the two single concentrations of IVM and CYP did not show a toxic effect on zebrafish development. In conclusion, our study suggests that IVM and CYP show a synergistic effect at common, ineffective concentrations, promoting malformation and cell death in fish development.

TI  - 6-benzylaminopurine exposure induced development toxicity and behaviour alteration in zebrafish (Danio rerio)*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) is one of the first synthetic hormones and has been widely used in fruit cultivation, gardening and agriculture. However, excessive use of 6-BA will cause potential harm to the environment and humans. Therefore, our research focused on assessing the impact of 6-BA on the development and neurobehavior of zebrafish. The results showed that 6-BA had little effect on the embryos from 2 hpf to 10 hpf. However, delayed development, decreased survival and hatchability were observed under 30 and 40 mg/L 6-BA from 24 hpf. 6-BA also reduced surface tension of embryonic chorions at 24 hpf. In addition, 6-BA caused abnormal morphology and promoted the accumulation of oxidative stress. Transcription of genes in connection with development and oxidative stress was also strikingly altered. Results of movement assay showed that zebrafish were less active and their behavior was significantly inhibited under the 20 and 30 mg/L 6-BA treatments. Locomotion-related genes th and mao were down-regulated by gradient, while the transcription of dbh was upregulated at a low concentration (2 mg/L) but decreased as the concentration increased. Moreover, 6-BA exposure caused increased arousal and decreased sleep. Sleep/wake related genes hcrt and hcrtr2 were upregulated, but decreased at 30 mg/L, while the mRNA level of aanat2 was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. To sum up, our results showed that 6-BA induced developmental toxicity, promoted the accumulation of oxidative stress, and damaged locomotion and sleep/wake behavior. @& nbsp;2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Exploration of Stereoselectivity in Embryo-Larvae (Danio rerio) Induced by Chiral PCB149 at the Bioconcentration and Gene Expression Levels
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This paper was designed to study stereoselective enrichment and changes in gene expression when zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo-larvae were exposed to racemic, (-)-or (+)-PCB149 (2,2', 3,4', 5',6-hexachlorobiphenyl). Based on bioconcentration analysis, non-racemic enrichment was significantly observed after racemic exposure. No isomerization between the two isomers was found after (-)/(+)-PCB149 exposure. Furthermore, based on gene expression-data mining, CYPs genes (cyp2k6, cyp19a1b, and cyp2aa4) were differential genes after (+)-PCB149 exposure. No obvious differences of dysregulation of gene expression caused by racemic and (-)-PCB149, were observed in embryo-larvae. The above results suggested that (-)-PCB149 could be considered as the main factor causing the dysregulation of gene expression in embryo-larvae after racemic exposure; and (+)-PCB149 should be pursued apart from the racemate, when considering the toxicity of chiral PCB149. Thus, the information in our study could provide new insights to assess the environmental risk of chiral PCBs in aquatic systems.

TI  - Sub-Lethal Peak Exposure to Insecticides Triggers Olfaction-Mediated Avoidance in Zebrafish Larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - In agricultural areas, insecticides inevitably reach water bodies via leaching or run-off. While designed to be neurotoxic to insects, insecticides have adverse effects on a multitude of organisms due to the high conservation of the nervous system among phyla. To estimate the ecological effects of insecticides, it is important to investigate their impact on nontarget organisms such as fish. Using zebrafish as the model, we investigated how different classes of insecticides influence fish behavior and uncovered neuronal underpinnings of the associated behavioral changes, providing an unprecedented insight into the perception of these chemicals by fish. We observed that zebrafish larvae avoid diazinon and imidacloprid while showing no response to other insecticides with the same mode of action. Moreover, ablation of olfaction abolished the aversive responses, indicating that fish smelled the insecticides. Assessment of neuronal activity in 289 brain regions showed that hypothalamic areas involved in stress response were among the regions with the largest changes, indicating that the observed behavioral response resembles reactions to stimuli that threaten homeostasis, such as changes in water chemistry. Our results contribute to the understanding of the environmental impact of insecticide exposure and can help refine acute toxicity assessment.

TI  - Integrative Characterization of Toxic Response of Zebra Fish (Danio rerio) to Deltamethrin Based on AChE Activity and Behavior Strength
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In order to characterize the toxic response of zebra fish (Danio rerio) to Deltamethrin (DM), behavior strength (BS) and muscle AChE activity of zebra fish were investigated. The results showed that the average values of both BS and AChE activity showed a similarly decreased tendency asDMconcentration increased, which confirmed the dose-effect relationship, and high and low levels of AChE and BS partly matched low and high levels of exposure concentrations in self-organizing map. These indicated that AChE and BS had slight different aspects of toxicity although overall trend was similar. Behavior activity suggested a possibility of reviving circadian rhythmin test organisms after exposure to the chemical in lower concentration (0.1 TU). This type of rhythm disappeared in higher concentrations (1.0 TU and 2.0 TU). Time series trend analysis of BS and AChE showed an evident time delayed effect of AChE, and a 2 h AChE inhibition delay with higher correlation coefficients (r) in different treatments was observed. It was confirmed that muscle AChE inhibition of zebra fish is a factor for swimming behavior change, though there was a 2 h delay, and other factors should be investigated to illustrate the detailed behavior response mechanism.

TI  - The Utility of Zebrafish as a Model for Screening Developmental Neurotoxicity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The developing central nervous system and the blood brain barrier are especially vulnerable and sensitive to different chemicals, including environmental contaminants and drugs. Developmental exposure to these compounds has been involved in several neurological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) have emerged as powerful toxicological model systems that can speed up chemical hazard assessment and can be used to extrapolate neurotoxic effects that chemicals have on humans. Zebrafish embryos and larvae are convenient for high-throughput screening of chemicals, due to their small size, low-cost, easy husbandry, and transparency. Additionally, zebrafish are homologous to other higher order vertebrates in terms of molecular signaling processes, genetic compositions, and tissue/organ structures as well as neurodevelopment. This mini review underlines the potential of the zebrafish as complementary models for developmental neurotoxicity screening of chemicals and describes the different endpoints utilized for such screening with some studies illustrating their use.

TI  - Toxicogenomic profiling after sublethal exposure to nerve- and muscle-targeting insecticides reveals cardiac and neuronal developmental effects in zebrafish embryos
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - For specific primary modes of action (MoA) in environmental non-target organisms, EU legislation restricts the usage of active substances of pesticides or biocides. Corresponding regulatory hazard assessments are costly, time consuming and require large numbers of non-human animal studies. Currently, predictive toxicology of development compounds relies on their chemical structure and provides little insights into toxicity mechanisms that precede adverse effects. Using the zebrafish embryo model, we characterized transcriptomic responses to a range of sublethal concentrations of six nerve-and muscle-targeting insecticides with different MoA (abamectin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, imidacloprid & methoxychlor). Our aim was to identify affected biological processes and suitable biomarker candidates for MoA-specific signatures. Abamectin showed the most divergent signature among the tested insecticides, linked to lipid metabolic processes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after imidacloprid exposure were primarily associated with immune system and inflammation. In total, 222 early responsive genes to either MoA were identified, many related to three major processes: (1) cardiac muscle cell development and functioning (tcap, desma, bag3, hspb1, hspb8, flnca, myoz3a, mybpc2b, actc2, tnnt2c), (2) oxygen transport and hypoxic stress (alas2, hbbe1.1, hbbe1.3, hbbe2, hbae3, igfbp1a, hif1al) and (3) neuronal development and plasticity (npas4a, egr1, btg2, ier2a, vgf). The thyroidal function related gene dio3b was upregulated by chlorpyrifos and downregulated by higher abamectin concentrations. Important regulatory genes for cardiac muscle (tcap) and forebrain development (npas4a) were the most frequently ifferentially expressed across all insecticide treatments. We consider the identified gene sets as useful early warning biomarker candidates, i.e. for developmental toxicity targeting heart and brain in aquatic vertebrates. Our findings provide a better understanding about early molecular events in response to the analyzed MoA. Perceptively, this promotes the development for sensitive and informative biomarker-based in vitro assays for toxicological MoA prediction and AOP refinement, without the suffering of adult fish.

TI  - Developmental Neurotoxicity of Methamidophos in the Embryo-Larval Stages of Zebrafish
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Methamidophos is a representative organophosphate insecticide. The knowledge of its developmental neurotoxicity is limited, especially for zebrafish in the early stages of their life. Four hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to several environmentally relevant concentrations of methamidophos (0, 25, and 500 mu g/L) for up to 72 hpf. Locomotor behavior was then studied in the zebrafish larvae at this timepoint. Acridine orange (AO) staining was carried out in the zebrafish larvae, and the mRNA levels of genes associated with neural development (mbp and syn2a) were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The number of escape responders for mechanical stimulation was significantly decreased in exposed groups. AO staining showed noticeable signs of apoptosis mainly in the brain. In addition, the mRNA levels of mbp and syn2a were both significantly down-regulated in exposed groups. Our study provides the first evidence that methamidophos exposure can cause developmental neurotoxicity in the early stages of zebrafish life, which may be caused by the effect of methamidophos on neurodevelopmental genes and the activation of cell apoptosis in the brain.

TI  - Chronic Toxicity of Primary Metabolites of Chloroacetamide and Glyphosate to Early Life Stages of Marbled Crayfish Procambarus virginalis
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Due to the rising population, it is necessary to ensure sustainable agricultural management, especially in agricultural production. Therefore, using pesticides is the only way to reach a sufficient number of crops for the human population. However, using these agrochemicals has one big disadvantage-harmful effects on non-target species. Since aquatic ecosystems are essential for biota, fauna, flora, and humans, this study provides information about the toxicity of primary metabolites of commonly used glyphosate and acetochlor herbicides. Generally, it is known that pesticide degradation products may have lower, the same, or even higher toxicity than their parental compounds. Moreover, the developmental stages are more predisposed to be affected by pollution than adults, and consequently, in the worst case, it may affect the whole species population. Due to this reason, we studied the toxicity of these metabolites on embryolarval marbled crayfish-how they can affect their growth, ontogenetic development, behaviour, and gill morphology. Our study revealed that these two metabolites alone induce changes in behaviour, antioxidant enzymes, and gill morphology, even in combination. Nevertheless, there is a gap in the knowledge about pesticides' metabolite toxicities, a small fraction of the hundreds with potential for entering the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, chronic toxicity tests are suitable for evaluating the toxicity of aquatic pollution. Degradation products of herbicides, alone and in combination, may affect non-target aquatic organisms via leaching or runoff from the soil. The effects of 50-day exposure of primary metabolites of chloroacetamide herbicide, acetochlor ESA (AE; 4 mu g/L), and glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; 4 mu g/L), and their combination (AMPA + AE; 4 + 4 mu g/L) on mortality, growth, oxidative stress, antioxidant response, behaviour, and gill histology of early life stages of marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) were investigated. While no treatment effects were observed on cumulative mortality or early ontogeny, growth was significantly lower in all exposed groups compared with the control group. Significant superoxide dismutase activity was observed in exposure groups, and significantly higher glutathione S-transferase activity only in the AMPA + AE group. The gill epithelium in AMPA + AE-exposed crayfish showed swelling as well as numerous unidentified fragments in interlamellar space. Velocity and distance moved in crayfish exposed to metabolites did not differ from controls, but increased activity was observed in the AMPA and AE groups. The study reveals the potential risks of glyphosate and acetochlor herbicide usage through their primary metabolites in the early life stages of marbled crayfish.

TI  - Zebrafish as an integrative vertebrate model to identify miRNA mechanisms regulating toxicity
T2  - TOXICOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an integrative vertebrate model ideal for toxicity studies. The zebrafish genome is sequenced with detailed characterization of all life stages. With their genetic similarity to humans, zebrafish models are established to study biological processes including development and disease mechanisms for translation to human health. The zebrafish genome, similar to other eukaryotic organisms, contains microRNAs (miRNAs) which function along with other epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression. Studies have now established that exposure to toxins and xenobiotics can change miRNA expression profiles resulting in various physiological and behavioral alterations. In this review, we cover the intersection of miRNA alterations from toxin or xenobiotic exposure with a focus on studies using the zebrafish model system to identify miRNA mechanisms regulating toxicity. Studies to date have addressed exposures to toxins, particulate matter and nanoparticles, various environmental contaminants including pesticides, ethanol, and pharmaceuticals. Current limitations of the completed studies and future directions for this research area are discussed.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Although epoxiconazole is the worldwidely used fungicide, limited information is known about its toxic effects and bioaccumulation behavior in freshwater ecosystems. In this study, zebrafish were exposed to epoxiconazole at concentrations of 100 and 1000 mu g L-1 for 21 d. H-1 NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that low- and high-dose epoxiconazole exposure resulted in two similar but not identical patterns for the change of endogenous metabolites related to energy, lipid and amino acid metabolism. The expression of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain, ATP synthesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation were further measured to explore the reason for the disturbed energy metabolism, finding epoxiconazole had an inhibition effect on the genes expression of the above ways. Significant enantio-selectivity was observed with (+)-epoxiconazole enrichment in the bioaccumulation process. These results will be of great importance in understanding the toxic effects induced by epoxiconazole and provide important basis for its comprehensive environmental assessment.

AB  - The species Ocimum basilicum L., Lamiaceae, is popular for culinary purposes and medicinal use as a larvicide, repellent, antifungal, and antimicrobial agent. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the chemical composition and antinociceptive effect of the volatile oil of O. basilicum flowers using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) (n = 6/group) treated orally (20 mu l) with volatile oil (0.25, 1.25, or 2.5 mg/ml; 20 mu l) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 20 mu l). The volatile oil of the O. basilicum flowers was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS, and the antinociceptive action is evaluated by different stimuli using motor parameters. The analysis of the chemical profile identified fourteen components with linalool (1) as a major chemical constituent (56.37%). The oral administration of volatile oil did not show any acute toxicity or behavior effects in all tested doses. The volatile oil has a pharmacological potential for the treatment of acute pain by modulation of opioid system, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (glutamatergic receptor), and the transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 and acid-sensing ion channels. Together, these data provide support for analgesic properties of the volatile oil and contribute to suggest that the adult zebrafish model presents the cheapest, cost-effective pharmacological alternative for the discovery of novel analgesics.

T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Pesticides reach water bodies through different routes, either owing to incorrect packaging disposal, direct application to control macrophytes, leaching from fields, or natural degradation processes. In the aquatic environment, adverse effects in non-target species that come in contact with these substances are poorly understood. Currently, the most used pesticides are glyphosate (GBH) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-based herbicides (DBH), as its presence in water bodies is already known, we used environmental concentrations and our exposure time comprised the entire period of organogenesis (3-120 h post-fertilization). We evaluated the response of embryos in their early development with the parameters of mortality, hatching, spontaneous movement, and heart rate; and it's through behavior the open field test and aversive stimulus, as well as biochemical analyzes of acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), catalase (CTL) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as a possible mechanism of action. Exposure to GBH decreased survival, caused hypermobility and anxiolytic behavior, negatively affected the anti-predatory behavior of the larvae, and increases acetylcholinesterase activity, whereas exposure to DBH caused only slight hypermobility in the larvae and increases acetylcholinesterase activity. These changes may compromise the perpetuation of the species, the search for partners/food, and facilitate the action of predators, which can result in serious ecological consequences.

AB  - Ethiprole is effective against a wide range of insects and has been used throughout the world. In this work, the toxicity, bioaccumulation and elimination of ethiprole and its main metabolites (ethiprole sulfone (M1), ethiprole sulfide (M2), ethiprole amide (M3), ethiprole sulfone amide (M4) and desethylsulfinyl ethiprole (M5)) in zebrafish Danio rerio were investigated at enantiomeric level. Rac-ethiprole showed high toxicity (96 h LC50 = 708 mu g L-1) and M2 was six times more toxic than ethiprole (111 mu g L-1). Enantioselective toxicity was observed, with the S-ethiprole (924 mu g L-1) being more toxic than R-ethiprole (2195 mu g center dot L-1). Rac-ethiprole and M2 could induce oxidative stress in the liver of adult zebrafish and developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish were exposed to 100 mu g L-1 rac-/R-/S-ethiprole and the bioaccumulation was monitored during a 21 d period followed by a 7 d metabolism. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of rac-ethiprole was 17, and the half-lives of rac-ethiprole and metabolites varied between 0.44 and 2.99 d. R-ethiprole was preferentially accumulated and metabolized in zebrafish. Besides, the metabolic pathways of R- and S-ethiprole were found to be different. This study indicated assessment of metabolites and enantioselectivity should be taken into consideration in evaluating environmental risks of ethiprole.

TI  - Carbofuran induces increased anxiety-like behaviors in female zebrafish (Danio rerio) through disturbing dopaminergic/norepinephrinergic system
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Carbofuran, a carbamate pesticide, is widely used in developing countries to manage insect pests. Studies have found that carbofuran posed potential risks for the neurotransmitter systems of non-target species, we speculated that these disruptive effects on the neurotransmitter systems could trigger anxiety-like behaviors. In this study, female zebrafish were exposed to environmental levels (5, 50, and 500 mu g/L) of carbofuran for 48 h to evaluate the effects of carbofuran on anxiety-like behaviors. Results showed that zebrafish exhibited more anxiety-like behaviors which proved by the observed higher bottom trend and more erratic movements in the novel tank after carbofuran treatment. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of carbofuran-induced anxiety-promoting effects, we measured the levels of neurotransmitters, precursors, and major metabolites, along with the level of gene expression and the enzyme activities involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. The results demonstrated that acute carbofuran exposure stimulated the mRNA expression and enzyme activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, which sequentially induced the increased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor relieved the anxiety-related changes induced by carbofuran, confirming the overactive tyrosine hydroxylase-mediated accumulation of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain was one of the main reasons for carbofuran-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the female zebrafish. Overall, our study indicated the environmental health risks of carbamate pesticide in inducing neurobehavioral disorders and provided novel insights into the investigation of the relevant underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Enantioselective toxic effects of mefentrifluconazole in the early life stage of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - The research on the enantioselective toxic effects of chiral pesticides on non-target aquatic organisms has attracted more and more attention. This study investigated the enantioselective toxic effects of mefentrifluconazole (MFZ) on acute toxicity, developmental toxicity, locomotor behaviors, and the mRNA relative expression levels of genes related to neurodevelopment and cardiac development in zebrafish embryos or larvae. The 96-h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) values (exposed to racemate and enantiomers of MFZ, that is, rac-MFZ/(-)-MFZ/(+)-MFZ) were 1.010, 1.552, and 0.753 mg/L for embryo, and 0.753, 1.187, and 0.553 mg/L for larvae. The rac-MFZ/(-)-MFZ/(+)-MFZ can affect the heart development of zebrafish embryos, accompanied by heart rate inhibition, yolk sac deformities, pericardial deformities, and down-regulation of genes related to cardiotoxicity in larvae in an enantioselective manner. Moreover, the rac-MFZ/(-)-MFZ/(+)-MFZ also can affect the neural development of zebrafish embryos, accompanied by autonomic movement inhibition, swimming speed and swimming distance abnormalities, and down-regulation of genes related to neurotoxicity in larvae in an enantioselective manner. For all toxicity endpoints, the effect of the (+)-MFZ to early-staged zebrafish were significantly greater than that of (-)-MFZ. These results will help distinguishing the difference of MFZ enantiomers to zebrafish, and provide scientific reference for improving the risk assessment of chiral pesticides MFZ.

TI  - Potency matters: Impacts of embryonic exposure to nAChR agonists thiamethoxam and nicotine on hatching success, growth, and neurobehavior in larval zebrafish
T2  - JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES
AB  - Thiamethoxam (TM) is a neonicotinoid insecticide that acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. While designed to specifically target invertebrate nAChRs, recent studies have reported adverse effects of neonicotinoid exposure in early life-stage fish. This study examined the health and neurobehavioral impacts of chronic exposure to various concentrations of TM or nicotine (NIC) in early life zebrafish (Danio rerio) in conjunction with in-silico molecular docking to compare their ligand-receptor interactions with vertebrate nAChR. Chronic exposure to both reduced survival by approximately 20% (163 mu g TM/l) and 25-100% (>= 0.49 mu g NIC/l). Hatching and growth were impaired following exposure to >= 0.21 mu g TM/l or 4.9 mu g NIC/l. Both TM and NIC produced morphological and behavioral indicators of neurotoxicity, with more potent effects following NIC exposure. NIC impaired embryonic motor activity by 40% (49 mu g NIC/l), while both TM and NIC significantly altered predator escape response in larvae, specifically the latency and the initial burst movement of the response were impacted. Molecular docking predicted variations in the type and strength of interactions that occur between NIC or TM and vertebrate nAChR. These findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to TM might impact general health and neurobehavior of early-stage zebrafish. Our data support hypotheses that TM presents low affinity for vertebrate nAChR but may still pose an adverse risk to larval fish growth and neurobehavior.

TI  - Embryonic Exposure to Thiamethoxam Reduces Survival and Alters Neurobehavior of Fathead Minnows
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Thiamethoxam is a commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide that acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. Although vertebrates are less sensitive to neonicotinoid insecticides than invertebrates, some neonicotinoids have been shown to cause neurobehavioral changes in larval fishes. In the present study, we examine the neurobehavioral toxicity of acute and chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam in fathead minnows at two different life stages. Whereas acute exposure of embryos to thiamethoxam does not appear to stimulate spontaneous contractions within 1 min, chronic exposure of embryos to 1.57 mu g or more thiamethoxam/L caused increased mortality as well as a subtle increase in spontaneous contraction frequency (SCF), which was negatively correlated with early hatching success. Chronic exposure of embryos to 155 mu g thiamethoxam/L impaired predator escape response, and chronic exposure to 0.02-14.61 mu g thiamethoxam/L impaired foraging efficiency of some fish. Fathead minnows exposed to thiamethoxam beginning post hatch did not experience changes to measured health or neurobehavioral indicators. Taken together, our findings indicate that embryonic life stages are more sensitive to thiamethoxam exposure than later larval life stages. Because early exposure to thiamethoxam can cause deficits in predatory escape behaviors and may impair foraging success, further study of the potential direct and nondirect impacts of thiamethoxam on wild fish populations is warranted.

TI  - The fungicide imazalil induces developmental abnormalities and alters locomotor activity during early developmental stages in zebrafish
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The fungicide imazalil (IMZ) is used extensively to protect vegetable fields, fruit plantations and post-harvest crops from rot. Likely due to its wide-spread use, IMZ is frequently detected in vegetable, fruit, soil and even surface water samples. Even though several previous studies have reported on the neurotoxicity of IMZ, its effects on the neurobehavior of zebrafish have received little attention to date. In this study, we show that the heartbeat and hatchability of zebrafish were significantly influenced by IMZ concentrations of 300 mu g L-1 or higher. Moreover, in zebrafish larvae, locomotor behaviors such as average swimming speed and swimming distance were significantly decreased after exposure to 300 mu g L-1 IMZ for 96 h, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression and activity were consistently inhibited in IMZ-treated fish. Our results further suggest that IMZ could act as a neuroendocrine disruptor by decreasing the expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as Glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), Myelin basic protein (Mbp) and Sonic hedgehog a (Shha) during early developmental stages of zebrafish. In conclusion, we show that exposure to IMZ has the potential to induce developmental toxicity and locomotor behavior abnormalities during zebrafish development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enantioselective bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and thyroid disruption assessment of cis-metconazole enantiomers in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Chiral triazole pesticides may cause enantioselectively adverse effects to non-target organisms. In this work, we employed zebrafish as an aquatic organism model to explore stereoselective acute toxicity, bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and thyroid disruption of cis-metconazole enantiomers. The median lethal concentration values of (1S, 5R)-metconazole, (1R, 5S)-metconazole, and the mixture of them against zebrafish were 4.01, 2.61 and 3.17 mg???L- 1, respectively. (1R, 5S)-Metconazole was preferentially bioaccumulated in zebrafish than (1S, 5R)metconazole, and the bioconcentration factor of (1R, 5S)-metconazole was 1.28-fold larger than that of (1S, 5R)metconazole. Then, the activity order of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S transferase enzymes in zebrafish was expressed as (1S, 5R)-metconazole > the mixture > (1R, 5S)-metconazole, while the order of malondialdehyde content in zebrafish was (1R, 5S)-metconazole > the mixture > (1S, 5R)-metconazole. Moreover, cis-metconazole exhibited enantioselective regulation effects on the levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine in zebrafish, and (1R, 5S)-metconazole possessed stronger thyroid disruption ability to zebrafish than the others. By virtue of molecular docking methodology, the binding affair and docking energy results supported that interactions between (1R, 5S)-metconazole and thyroid hormone receptors were much stronger than those between (1S, 5R)-metconazole and same receptors. This study of enantioselective evaluation of cis-metconazole in zebrafish can provide favorable information for risk assessments of chiral pesticides toward environment and health of aquatic organisms.

TI  - The Possible Role of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 on Locomotor Activity and Oxidative Stress in a Rotenone-Induced Zebrafish Model of Parkinson's Disease
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
AB  - Background. As every organ within the body, the brain is also extremely susceptible to a plethora of noxious agents that change its chemistry. One component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. Results. There were no statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social interaction and locomotor tests (p>0.05). However, several exceptions have been noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p<0.05). We further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone+probiotics (p>0.05), relevant changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p<0.05 and p<0.005, respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p<0.05) have been observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the other three groups. Conclusions. Our results suggest that rotenone can be successfully used to trigger Parkinson's disease-related symptomatology in zebrafish.</p>

TI  - 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid containing herbicide impairs essential visually guided behaviors of larval fish
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Aquatic herbicides are used worldwide to eradicate nuisance and invasive plants despite limited knowledge of their toxicity to non-target organisms. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a common active ingredient in commercial herbicide formulations, which triggers plant cell death by mimicking the plant-specific hormone auxin. Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.

TI  - Kinetic Processes of Acute Atrazine Toxicity to Brachydanio rerio in the Presence and Absence of Suspended Sediments
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Suspended sediments can decrease the apparent bio-concentration factor of organic pollutants through adsorption. However, whether this process also weakens the toxicity of organic pollutants to non-target aquatic organisms is not clear. Therefore, natural sediments were chosen as suspended sediment examples in this research applying atrazine as the target pollutant and Brachydanio rerio (more recently, Danio rerio (Zebrafish)) as the target organism to conduct acute toxicity experiments. The concentration of atrazine in aqueous solution was measured as a time series. Results show that without suspended sediments, the 96-h LC50 of atrazine to Brachydanio rerio is 29.06 mg/l at 95 % confidence interval (24.41 to 40.70 mg/l). For suspended sediments of 7500 and 15,000 mg/l, the LC50 (i.e., concentration resulting in 50 % mortality) equates to 30.74 and 39.51 mg/l, respectively, and the corresponding confidence intervals are between 27.17 and 40.91 mg/l and between 30.43 and 126.93 mg/l in that order. Probit analysis, which is a type of regression used to analyze binomial response variables, was applied using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. For the series of no suspended solids (SS), 7500 and 15,000 mg/l SS, the so-called no-observed-effective concentrations were 3, 9, and 15 mg/l, correspondingly. The uptake quantity and uptake rate of atrazine by B. rerio according to atrazine concentrations in the aqueous solution were computed. The research indicates that suspended sediments can decrease the absorbed rate of atrazine by B. rerio. Thus, suspended sediments weaken the acute toxicity of atrazine to B. rerio.

TI  - Sensitivity of zebrafish to environmental toxins implicated in Parkinson's disease
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and movement defects, including bradykinesia, tremor, and postural imbalance. Whereas the etiology and pathogenesis of PD is still poorly understood, studies in animal models are providing important insights. One valuable type of animal model for PD is established by treating animals with PD-inducing neurotoxins, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat. These neurotoxins are thought to inhibit mitochondrial complex I activity leading to oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, proteasomal dysfunction, and, eventually, dopamine neuronal loss. However, the genes and pathways that underlie the neurotoxicity of these agents are not known. In this study, we explored the effect of MPTP, rotenone, and paraquat in both adult and larval zebrafish, which are highly amenable to genetic analysis that can lead to the identification of the underlying genes and pathways. Here, we report that adult zebrafish display behavioral alterations, including decreased locomotor activity in response to MPTP, whereas larval zebrafish exhibited developmental, behavioral, and DA sensitivity to these agents. Taken together, these findings suggest that zebrafish could be a valuable model for genetically dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of PD-inducing agents.

TI  - Acute Exposure to the Neonicotinoid Insecticide Imidacloprid of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Gonads: A Histopathological Approach
T2  - ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
AB  - Depending on the increase in agricultural production, the use of pesticides has also increased worldwide. Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid pesticide and one of the most widely used in the world. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the histopathological changes in zebrafish ovary and testis tissue caused by imidacloprid, which pollutes the aquatic ecosystem in various ways. It has been shown that imidacloprid causes histopathological changes in the gonads by causing deterioration in the structure of reproductive cells. Neonicotinoids are the new class of insecticides that are high target specificity to insects. Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid that is the most widely used insecticide in the world. As a result of its widespread use in agriculture, imidacloprid interferes with the aquatic system and threatens the aquatic environment. In this study, an investigation of the histopathological effects of imidacloprid on zebrafish gonads was aimed. Zebrafish were exposed to 9.5 mg/L, 19 mg/L, and 38 mg/L of imidacloprid for 5 days, considering the 96 h LC50 value. After dissecting the gonadal tissues, routine histological techniques were applied, and the tissues were stained with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), Toluidine Blue (TB), and Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Sections were examined under a light microscope. While normal gonad histology was observed in the control group, histopathological alternations such as degeneration and union in the seminiferous tubules, hypertrophy in spermatogenic and Leydig cells, and interstitial fibrosis were detected in testicular tissue of the experimental groups. In the ovarian tissues of the experimental groups, structural deterioration in oocytes, autolysis, increase in the number of atretic oocytes, vacuolization in cortical alveoli, thickening and curling in the zona radiata, and opening in the perifollicular layers were detected.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of the fungicide ziram in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Ziram is a broad spectrum pesticide that belongs to the class of dimethyl-dithiocarbamate (DTC) fungicides. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of ziram in developing zebrafish. Ziram was highly toxic to zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC50 value of 1082.54 nM (similar to 0.33 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to solvent control (0.1% DMSO), or one dose of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM ziram for 96 h. Ziram induced lethality in a dose-dependent manner, decreased hatching rate and heartbeat, and caused wavy deformities at 72 and 96 hpf at 100 and 1000 nM. Basal oxygen consumption rates of zebrafish at 24 hpf were decreased with 1000 nM, suggesting that ziram affects oxidative phosphorylation. We also measured the expression of transcripts associated with the oxidative stress response (sod] and sod2) and dopamine receptor signaling at similar to 96 h of exposure. There was no difference in the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, nor those related to the dopamine system. Locomotor activity was also assessed in larval zebrafish (7 dpf), and ziram increased total activity, the velocity in light zone, and total distance moved at 10 nM, while it decreased the mean time spent in the dark zone at 1 and 10 nM. Behavioral responses were dependent upon the time point and clutch examined. These data demonstrate that ziram negatively impacts embryonic development (i.e. mortality, hatching, heartbeat and notochord development) of zebrafish, decreases basal respiration of embryos, and alters behavioral responses in larvae.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of neem commercial formulation (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The neurotoxic effects of a commercial formulation of Azadirachta indica A. Juss, also called neem or nim, in adult zebrafish were determined using behavioral models. General activity, anxiety-like effects, and learning and memory in a passive avoidance task were assessed after exposure to 20 or 40 mu l/L neem. The results showed that 20 mu l/L neem reduced the number of runs. Both neem concentrations increased the number of climbs to the water surface, and 40 mu l/L increased the number of tremors. In the anxiety test, the 20 mu l/L dose increased the number of entries in the light side compared with controls, but the latency to enter the dark side and the freezing behavior in this side did not changed. In relation to controls, the 40 mu l/L neem reduced the latency to enter in the light side, did not change the number of entries in this side and increased freezing behavior in the light side. In the passive avoidance test, pre-training and pre-test neem exposure to 40 mu l/L decreased the response to the learning task. Thus, no impairment was observed in this behavioral test. We conclude that neem reduced general activity and increased anxiety-like behavior but did not affect learning and memory. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Indoxacarb is a typical chiral insecticide widely used in agricultural pest control. In the present study, zebrafish was used as a model animal to explore the enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior of indoxacarb to nontarget species in aquatic environments. Zebrafish were exposed to 0.025 and 0.1 mg/L rac-indoxacarb solution for 12 d under the semistatic method, and the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and enantiomeric fraction of zebrafish were investigated. The results showed that the (-)-R-indoxacarb preferentially accumulated in zebrafish. The BCF values at 0.025 mg/L exposure levels were 1079.8 and 83.4 L/kg for (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb after 12 d, respectively. The BCF values at 0.1 mg/L exposure levels were 1752.1 and 137.0 L/kg for (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb after 10 d, respectively. The half-life values of (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb were 3.47 and 2.05 d for 0.025 mg/L concentration exposure and 4.95 and 2.66 d for 0.1 mg/L concentration exposure, respectively. The enantiomeric fraction values were in the range of 0.48 to 0.55 and 0.89 to 1.00 for water and zebrafish samples, respectively. Studies on the enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior of indoxacarb will provide data for assessing the environmental fate and potential toxic effects of indoxacarb on aquatic organisms.

TI  - Mepanipyrim induces visual developmental toxicity and vision-guided behavioral alteration in zebrafish larvae
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - Mepanipyrim, an anilinopyrimidine fungicide, has been extensively used to prevent fungal diseases in fruit culture. Currently, research on mepanipyrim-induced toxicity in organisms is still very scarce, especially visual developmental toxicity. Here, zebrafish larvae were employed to investigate mepanipyrim-induced visual developmental toxicity. Intense light and monochromatic light stimuli-evoked escape experiments were used to investigate vision-guided behaviors. Meanwhile, transcriptomic sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR assays were applied to assess the potential mechanisms of mepanipyrim-induced visual developmental toxicity and vision-guided behavioral alteration. Our results showed that mepanipyrim exposure could induce retinal impairment and vision-guided behavioral alteration in larval zebrafish. In addition, the grk1b gene of the phototransduction signaling pathway was found to be a potential aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated gene. Mepanipyrim-induced visual developmental toxicity was potentially related to the AhR signaling pathway. Furthermore, mepanipyrim-induced behavioral alteration was guided by the visual function, and the effects of mepanipyrim on long and middle wavelength light-sensitive opsins may be the main cause of vision-guided behavioral alteration. Our results provide insights into understanding the relationship between visual development and vision-guided behaviors induced by mepanipyrim exposure. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Comparison of R-Metalaxyl and rac-Metalaxyl in Acute, Chronic, and Sublethal Effect on Aquatic Organisms: Daphnia magna, Scenedesmus quadricanda, and Danio rerio
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Chiral pesticides are used widely in the world, and at present, older racemic products are being replaced by enantiopure products because of accelerated development of asymmetry synthesis techniques. Pesticides as xenobiotic released into environment impose a great stress on nontarget organisms. Although it is a necessary procedure for pesticides to have a registration based on toxicological data from nontarget organism, until now ecological risk assessment about metalaxyl only depend on racemic products. Hence, we investigated the acute, chronic, and sublethal toxicity of R-metalaxy and rac-metalaxyl on aquatic organisms such as D. magna (Daphnia magna), algae (Scenedesmus quadricanda), and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed a significant difference in toxicity between R-metalaxyl and rac-metalaxyl. R-Metalaxy was about 20-fold more toxic to algae than rac-metalaxyl with IC50 of 222.89 +/- 1.18 mg/L and 19.95 +/- 1.12 mg/L, respectively. Similarly, R-metalaxyl was about fourfold toxic to D. magna than rac-metalaxyl according to the individual 24-h-LC50 values, and sixfold toxic than rac-metalaxyl based on 24-h-EC50 values. In the light of 48-h-LC50 and EC50, this difference in toxicity was more significant. As for adult zebrafish, there was no pronounced difference in acute toxicity, in addition, at sublethal level a different pattern in inducing Na+,K+-ATPase activity between them was found. In general, R-metalaxyl seemed more toxic to aquatic organisms than rac-metalaxyl. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 24: 148-156, 2009.

The environmental behavior of herbicide lactofen may be enantioselective and the metabolites may have high toxic effects in individual or in combination. In this work, the enantioselective bioaccumulation, metabolism and toxic effects of lactofen and three metabolites (desethyl lactofen, acifluorfene, and amino acifluorfene) in zebrafish were investigated. The antioxidase activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase), lipid peroxidation content were measured after exposure, and genetic toxicity was evaluated by a micronucleus test. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) method was used to determine the effects of the lactofen and its metabolites as well as their combinations. The metabolites were found to have higher toxic effects, and enantioselective toxic effects of lactofen and desethyl lactofen were observed, with the S-enantiomer more toxic. Based on IBR values, synergistic effects existed in combination of lactofen and desethyl lactofen, while antagonistic effects of lactofen with acifluorfene or amino acifluorfene were observed. Zebrafish were exposed to 0.5 mg L-1 lactofen and the bioaccumulation were measured during a 15 d period followed by a 7 d elimination. The half-lives of the metabolites varied between 0.66 and 5.21 d, with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in the range of 39-120. The metabolic pathways of R- and S-lactofen were found to be significantly different. The results supported our hypothesis. Therefore, the assessment of enantiomers and metabolites in individual or in combination should be taken into consideration in evaluating chiral pesticide risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Atrazine promotes biochemical changes and DNA damage in a Neotropical fish species
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The effects of Atrazine, an herbicide used worldwide and considered as a potential contaminant in aquatic environments, were assessed on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus acutely (24 and 48 h) exposed to 2 or 10 pg L-1 of atrazine by using a set of biochemical and genetic biomarkers. The following parameters were measured in the liver: activity of the biotransformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S transferase (GST), antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), content of reduced glutathione (GSH), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and occurrence of lipid peroxidation (LPO); in brain and muscle the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and DNA damage (comet assay) on erythrocytes, gills and liver cells. A general decreasing trend on the biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes was observed in the liver of P. lineatus exposed to atrazine; except for GR, all the other antioxidant enzymes (SOD. CAT and GPx) and biotransformation enzymes (EROD and GST) showed inhibited activity. Changes in muscle or brain AChE were not detected. DNA damage was observed in the different cell types of fish exposed to the herbicide, and it was probably not from oxidative origin, since no increase in ROS generation and LPO was detected in the liver. These results show that atrazine behaves as enzyme inhibitor, impairing hepatic metabolism, and produces genotoxic damage to different cell types of P. lineatus. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Swimming impairment and acetylcholinesterase inhibition in zebrafish exposed to copper or chlorpyrifos separately, or as mixtures
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Pesticides such as chlorpyrifos (CPF) and metals such as copper can impair swimming behavior in fish. However, the impact to swimming behavior from exposure to mixtures of neurotoxicants has received little attention. In the current study, we analyzed spontaneous swimming rates of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate in vivo mixture interactions involving two chemical classes. Zebrafish were exposed to the neurotoxicants copper chloride (CuCl, 0.1 mu M, 0.25 mu M, 0.6 mu M, or 63, 16,40 ppb), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 0.1 mu M, 025 mu M, 0.6 mu M, or 35, 88, 220 ppb) and binary mixtures for 24 h to better understand the effects of Cu on CPF neurotoxicity. Exposure to CPF increased the number of animals undergoing freeze responses (an anti-predator behavior) and, at the highest CPF dose (0.6 mu M), elicited a decrease in zebrafish swimming rates. Interestingly, the addition of Cu caused a reduction in the number of zebrafish in the CPF exposure groups undergoing freeze responses. There was no evidence of additive or synergistic toxicity between Cu and CPF. Although muscle AChE activity was significantly reduced by CPF, there was a relatively poor relationship among muscle AChE concentrations and swimming behavior, suggesting non-muscle AChE mechanisms in the loss of swimming behavior. In summary, we have observed a modulating effect of Cu on CPF swimming impairment that appears to involve both AChE and non-AChE mechanisms. Our study supports the utility of zebrafish in understanding chemical mixture interactions and neurobehavioral injury. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Glyphosate targets fish monoaminergic systems leading to oxidative stress and anxiety
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Glyphosate is the active ingredient of some of the most highly produced and used herbicides worldwide. The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems. Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including autism related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L) concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant concentrations of this compound (ng/L to mu g/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 mu g/L) for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety. The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally, the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.

TI  - Acute toxicity of the insecticide EPN upon zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and its related adverse effects: Verification of abnormal cardiac development and seizure-like events
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Toxicological studies of O-ethyl-O-(4-nitrophenyl) phenylphosphonothioate (EPN) to aquatic vertebrates have been reported, but no reports on toxic mechanism was reported. As zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to EPN, no changes in their survival and hatching rates were observed until 96 h post fertilization (hpf), even at the highest treated concentration of 500 mu g/L. In both 250 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L, edemas were observed in the heart and yolk sac, and a blood pool was also found. Acridine orange staining confirmed apoptotic phynotype, which was the strongest in embryos at 48 hpf. No noticeable difference in the formation and the shape of blood vessels of Tg(fli1a:EGFP) was observed. However, the total body length and number of somite were decreased. Heart formation in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) were not properly proceeded, and the ventricle did not beat normally at 500 mu g/L level. Cardiac development-related genes, myl7 and nppa, were significantly down- and up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner. The slowed heartbeat was confirmed using Tg(gata1:EGFP), showing stagnant blood flow and seizure-like events were observed. Altogether, EPN can be the cause for the abnormal heart development accompanied by blood stagnation in embryos, interfering normal development with their inner circulatory system.

TI  - Subchronic atrazine exposure changes defensive behaviour profile and disrupts brain acetylcholinesterase activity of zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Animal behaviour is the interaction between environment and an individual organism, which also can be influenced by its neighbours. Variations in environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were exposed to ATZ for 14 days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2% acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000 mu g/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same tank was recorded for 6 min and biological samples were prepared. Our results showed that 1000 mu g/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus, but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain. Exposure to 10 mu g/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate affects motor behavior and axonal growth in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) is an environmental contaminant that poses serious risks to aquatic organisms and their associated ecosystem. Recently, the reproductive and developmental toxicology of TBOEP has been reported. However, fewer studies have assessed the neurotoxic effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. In this study, zebrafish embryos were subjected to waterborne exposure of TBOEP at 0, 50, 500, 1500 and 2500 μg/L from 2 to 144-h post-fertilization (hpf). Behavioral measurements showed that TBOEP exposure reduced embryonic spontaneous movement and decreased swimming speed of larvae in response to dark stimulation. In accordance with these motor effects, TBOEP treatment reduced neuron-specific GFP expression in transgenic Tg (HuC-GFP) zebrafish larvae and inhibited the growth of secondary motoneurons, as well as decreased expression of marker genes related to central nervous system development in TBOEP treated group. Furthermore, increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as reduction of SOD activity were detected in TBOEP exposure group. The present results showed that the alteration in motor neuron and oxidative stress could together lead to the motor behavior alterations induced by TBOEP.

TI  - Effects of the exposure of fish to triazine herbicides
T2  - NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Triazines are an important group of herbicides, which have been used extensively or selectively both in agricultural and non-agricultural areas worldwide for more than fifty years to control broadleaf and some grassy weeds. As a consequence of their massive application, they have become and remain significant environmental pollutants, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are an integral part of the aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress. Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term exposure to low concentrations. Nevertheless, an impact on the overall behavioral response of fish cannot be excluded.

TI  - Integrated biomarkers response confirm the antioxidant role of diphenyl diselenide against atrazine
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is a herbicide worldwide used. That can cause oxidative damage in non-target organisms, such as fish. Furthermore, the threat of exposure to pesticides together with poor nutrition is hazardous to the normal development of fish, and supplementation of the fish diet with antioxidants compounds is an alternative approach to prevent the hazardous effects of pesticide exposure. Here we aimed to investigate the capacity of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) diet supplementation to improve the antioxidant defense of Cyprinus carpio (carp) exposed to environmental concentrations of ATZ. To prove the efficiency of (PhSe)(2), we used the Integrated Biomarkers Response (IBR) methodology. Therefore, carp were fed for 8 weeks diets either with or without (PhSe)(2) and exposed to 2 or 10 mu g/L of ATZ for 96 h, euthanized, and their liver, gills, and muscle tissues were removed for biochemical assays. ATZ was able to cause oxidative damage from reactive species production in all tissues of carp, as observed by the increase of lipid peroxidation and protein damage. The activity of some antioxidant enzymes was inhibited in carp exposed to ATZ. However, (PhSe)(2) supplementation was able to prevent this ATZ-induced damage by improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes and through antioxidant competence of (PhSe)(2)per se. Furthermore, IBR was shown to be a useful tool to compare treatments, even at different concentrations, and identify the efficiently antioxidant behavior of the organoselenium compound

TI  - Fenvalerate triggers Parkinson-like symptom during zebrafish development through initiation of autophagy and p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling pathway
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Fenvalerate (FEN), one of the most used synthetic pyrethroids, has the potential to interfere with human neural function. , Flowever, far too little attention was paid to the mechanism of FEN-induced neurotoxicity. Thus we exposed zebrafish to FEN from 4 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf), and analyzed the morphology and behavior of zebrafish. Our results showed that FEN decreased the survival rate of zebrafish, with increased malformation rates and abnormal behaviors. Furthermore, we found typical parkinson-like symptoms in FEN-exposed zebrafish with increases in parkinson's disease (PD), ubiquitin, and Lewy bodies-relevant genes. We also observed the loss of dopaminergic neurons in both FEN-exposed zebrafish and PC12 cells, which were all associated with PD-like symptoms. Besides, FEN activated autophagy by the enhanced expressions of p-mTOR, and LC3-II but the reduction of p62. Further, FEN initially activated p-p38 MAPK followed by p-mTOR, which triggered the transcription of genes responsible for autophagy process and prompted the Lewy bodies neuron generation leading to the PD-like symptoms. This process was inhibited by both 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK selective inhibitor) in zebrafish and PC12 cells. These results suggest that FEN might cause parkinson-like symptom during zebrafish development through induction of autophagy and activation of p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling pathway. The study revealed the potential mechanism of FEN-induced neurotoxicity and should give new insights into a significant environmental risk factor of developing parkinson's disease.

TI  - Fate of Fenhexamid in Water-Sediment Systems: Degradation Under Aerobic/Anaerobic Conditions and Bioaccumulation by Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Little is known about the environmental behavior of fenhexamid (FEN) in aquatic ecosystems such as degradation and bioaccumulation, in spite of the fact that it is critical for a comprehensive assessment of its ecological risks. This study investigated for the first time the degradation of FEN in water-sediment systems under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and also bioaccumulation by zebrafish (Danio rerio). Water and sediments from different natural waters including river HR and lake HL were applied to build up water-sediment microcosms in the laboratory. When FEN was introduced into the aqueous phase, it would partition from water to sediment gradually and be decomposed in sediment compartment. The dissipation half-lives of FEN in water were 43.8, 75.9, 31.3, and 37.2 days for HR-aerobic, HR-anaerobic, HL-aerobic, and HL-anaerobic microcosms, respectively. Moreover, FEN degradation rate constants of whole systems varied from 0.0045 to 0.0088 per day and the half-lives were from 78.4 to 155 days. The aerobic circumstances were demonstrated to be favor of FEN degradation. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) was 2.6-3.1 obtained from zebrafish exposure experiments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Clearly, our results indicated that FEN could be accumulated in the deeper layer of sediment owing to the anaerobic condition against FEN degradation, but FEN showed a low potential for bioaccumulation. These may aid in comprehensive understanding the fate and risk of FEN in aquatic environment.

TI  - Atrazine and its main metabolites alter the locomotor activity of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) and its main chlorometabolites, i.e., diaminochlorotriazine (DACT), deisopropylatrazine (DIP), and deethylatrazine (DE), have been widely detected in aquatic systems near agricultural fields. However, their possible effects on aquatic animals are still not fully understood. In this study, it was observed that several developmental endpoints such as the heart beat, hatchability, and morphological abnormalities were influenced by ATZ and its metabolites in different developmental stages. In addition, after 5 days of exposure to 30, 100, 300 mu g L-1 ATZ and its main chlorometabolites, the swimming behaviors of larval zebrafish were significantly disturbed, and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were consistently inhibited. Our results also demonstrate that ATZ and its main chlorometabolites are neuroendocrine disruptors that impact the expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as Ache, Gap43, Gfap, Syn2a, Shha, Mbp, Elavl3, Nestin and Ngn1 in early developmental stages of zebrafish. According to our results, it is possible that not only ATZ but also its metabolites (DACT, DIP and DE) have the same or even more toxic effects on different endpoints of the early developmental stages of zebrafish.

AB  - As a systemic triazole fungicide, limited information is known about diniconazole. In this study, toxicological effects and bioaccumulation behavior of diniconazole in zebrafish were both evaluated to perform an overall assessment of its environmental risk towards aquatic organisms. The H-1 NMR-based metabolomics analysis revealed that 70 mu g L-1 diniconazole exposure increased valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, lactate and choline, accompanied by decreased glucose, creatine and taurine, in comparison to the control. In the exposure group of 300 mu g L-1 diniconazole, only down-regulated glucose and creatine were observed. The above results indicated that diniconazole disturbed energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. Histological examination showed that the swell and vacuolization in the liver, as well as the reduction of spermatids in the diniconazole exposure groups. No enantioselectivity was observed in the bioaccumulation process of both 70 and 300 mu g L-1 diniconazole exposure groups. The above results play a vital role for a comprehensive environmental assessment of diniconazole. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hazard identification of imidacloprid to aquatic environment
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The use of a very effective insecticide against sucking pests, neonicotinoid imidacloprid, has been increasing extensively. For this reason elevated concentrations are expected in aquatic environment. Despite this fact, there is still a lack of data available on its possible risk for the environment. In this study, the potential hazards of imidacloprid and its commercial product Confidor SL 200 to aquatic environment were identified by the acute and chronic toxicity assessment using bacteria Vibrio fischeri, algae Desmodesmus subspicatus, crustacean Daphnia magna, fish Danio, rerio and the ready biodegradability determination. We found out, that imidacloprid was not highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial product. Imidacloprid was found persistent in water samples and not readily biodegradable in aquatic environment. Due to increased future predicted use of commercial products containing imidacloprid and the findings of this work, we recommend additional toxicity and biodegradability studies of other commercial products with imidacloprid as an active constituent.

TI  - Developmental exposure to mepanipyrim induces locomotor hyperactivity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Mepanipyrim is a widely used fungicide, and residues of mepanipyrim are frequently detected in commodities. However, the neurotoxicity and underlying mechanisms of mepanipyrim are still insufficiently understood. In this study, zebrafish embryos at 0.5-1.0 post-fertilization hours (hpf) were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L mepanipyrim for 7 days. Our results showed that mepanipyrim could cause the locomotor hyperactivity and increase the concentration of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and the Na+/K+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities in zebrafish larvae. We have conducted the RNA-sequence and RT-qPCR to analyze the gene expressions. The mRNA expression levels of calcium/sodium ion conduction associated genes were observably up-regulated, demonstrating that mepanipyrim could enhance the cell energy metabolism, the synaptic transmission and skeletal muscle contraction, which were consistent with the locomotor hyperactivity. Meanwhile, exposure to mepanipyrim could significantly change the gene expression levels of gad1, bdnf, nlgn1, and type A and B GABA receptors in zebrafish larvae. This is the first study focusing on the underlying mechanisms of the neurotoxic effects that are induced by mepanipyrim. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Swimming performance of fish was tracked by a real-time toxicity biomonitoring system and transformed into data to calculate individual and fish school behavioural endpoints. Behavioural responses under metals were in accordance with the Stepwise Behavioural Response model. Significant and concentrationdependent effects on swimming speed and turning times were found at concentrations equal to or higher than 3.5 mg L-1 for zinc and 0.7 mg L-1 for chromium. Swimming height significantly declined in concentrations equal to or higher than 3.5 mg L-1 under zinc exposure, while for the chromium treatment, it significantly increased in lower concentration exposures and decreased in higher concentration exposures. Average distance and dispersion of fish school decreased at the beginning but there were no obvious changes during the whole exposure period. Behavioural responses under metal exposures were timedependent: avoidance (increased speed and turning times and decreased average distance and dispersion) might be the first response and followed by height changes. Changes in behavioural endpoints `swimming speed and height' can be used as early stress responses for acute aquatic metal contamination as part of ecological risk assessment.

TI  - A Critical Review of Zebrafish Models of Parkinson’s Disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - A wide variety of human diseases have been modelled in zebrafish, including various types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Recent reviews have summarized the currently available zebrafish models of Parkinson’s Disease, which include gene-based, chemically induced and chemogenetic ablation models. The present review updates the literature, critically evaluates each of the available models of Parkinson’s Disease in zebrafish and compares them with similar models in invertebrates and mammals to determine their advantages and disadvantages. We examine gene-based models, including ones linked to Early-Onset Parkinson’s Disease: PARKIN, PINK1, DJ-1, and SNCA; but we also examine LRRK2, which is linked to Late-Onset Parkinson’s Disease. We evaluate chemically induced models like MPTP, 6-OHDA, rotenone and paraquat, as well as chemogenetic ablation models like metronidazole-nitroreductase. The article also reviews the unique advantages of zebrafish, including the abundance of behavioural assays available to researchers and the efficiency of high-throughput screens. This offers a rare opportunity for assessing the potential therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological interventions. Zebrafish also are very amenable to genetic manipulation using a wide variety of techniques, which can be combined with an array of advanced microscopic imaging methods to enable in vivo visualization of cells and tissue. Taken together, these factors place zebrafish on the forefront of research as a versatile model for investigating disease states. The end goal of this review is to determine the benefits of using zebrafish in comparison to utilising other animals and to consider the limitations of zebrafish for investigating human disease.

TI  - Toxicity and neurotoxicity profiling of contaminated sediments from Gulf of Bothnia (Sweden): a multi-endpoint assay with Zebrafish embryos
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB  - BackgroundThe toxicological characterization of sediments is an essential task to monitor the quality of aquatic environments. Many hazardous pollutants may accumulate in sediments and pose a risk to the aquatic community. The present study provides an attempt to integrate a diagnostic whole mixture assessment workflow based on a slightly modified Danio rerio embryo acute toxicity test with chemical characterization. Danio rerio embryos were directly exposed to sieved sediment (63m) for 96h. Sediment samples were collected from three polluted sites (Kramfors, Sundsvall and ornskoldsvik) in the Gulf of Bothnia (Sweden) which are characterized by a long history of pulp and paper industry impact. Effect data were supported by chemical analyses of 237 organic pollutants and 30 trace elements.ResultsThe results show that malformations and neurotoxic compounds are the main drivers of differentiation in chemical and effects analyses, respectively. Specific spinal cord malformations and delayed hatching were observed only in sediments from Kramfors while light hyperactivity was seen only after exposure to sediments from Sundsvall.ConclusionsOur experiments demonstrate that specific chemical profiles lead to specific effect patterns in Danio rerio embryos. In fact, behavioral endpoints could help detect the exposure to neurotoxins, and the observation of body malformations seems to be a potential tool for the identification of site-specific pollutants as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and several pesticides. Overall, results show the suitability of Danio rerio embryos for the fast screening of sediment samples.

TI  - First description of behavior and immune system relationship in fish
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Considering the intriguing relationship between immune system and behavior recently described in mammals, and the lack of information of this relationship in fish, here we describe for the first time the interaction between the immune system and social and exploratory behavior in zebrafish. Fish high responders to novelty (HRN) presented a proinflammatory profile, with increased IL-1 beta and reduced IL-10 expression compared to fish low responders to novelty (LRN). Likewise, fish less responsive to social stimuli have a reduced expression of INF-gamma We show that fish with different behavior patterns have differences in the immune response. Our findings indicate that the interplay between immune system and behavior in zebrafish is similar to that found in mammalian models and that zebrafish should be considered as a potential model organism to study the relationship between immune system and behavior.

TI  - Glyphosate induces toxicity and modulates calcium and NO signaling in zebrafish embryos
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Glyphosate, an herbicide used worldwide, has emerged as a pollutant. However, its toxic effects are debated by regulatory authorities. Therefore, it is essential to keep the use of such chemicals under continuous observation, and their effects must be re-evaluated. We used zebrafish embryos to evaluate the toxic effects of glyphosate and its mechanisms. We found that glyphosate induced significant toxicity in a time and concentration-dependent manner. We observed an LD50 of 66.04 +/- 4.6 mu g/mL after 48 h of exposure. Glyphosate significantly reduced the heartbeat in a time and concentration-dependent manner indicating cardiotoxicity. Selective downregulation of Cacanal1C (L-type calcium channel) and ryr2a (Ryanodine receptor) genes along with selective upregulation of hspb11 (heat shock protein) gene was observed upon exposure to glyphosate indicating alterations in the calcium signaling. A reduction in the nitric oxide (NO) generation was also observed in the zebrafish embryos upon exposure to glyphosate. Our results indicate that glyphosate induces significant toxicity including cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Further, cardiotoxicity may be due to changes in calcium and NO signaling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Olfactory System of Zebrafish as a Model for the Study of Neurotoxicity and Injury: Implications for Neuroplasticity and Disease
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The olfactory system, composed of the olfactory organs and the olfactory bulb, allows organisms to interact with their environment and through the detection of odor signals. Olfaction mediates behaviors pivotal for survival, such as feeding, mating, social behavior, and danger assessment. The olfactory organs are directly exposed to the milieu, and thus are particularly vulnerable to damage by environmental pollutants and toxicants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and surfactants, among others. Given the widespread occurrence of olfactory toxicants, there is a pressing need to understand the effects of these harmful compounds on olfactory function. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for studying human physiology, disease, and toxicity. Additionally, the anatomical components of the zebrafish olfactory system are similar to those of other vertebrates, and they present a remarkable degree of regeneration and neuroplasticity, making it an ideal model for the study of regeneration, reorganization and repair mechanisms following olfactory toxicant exposure. In this review, we focus on (1) the anatomical, morphological, and functional organization of the olfactory system of zebrafish; (2) the adverse effects of olfactory toxicants and injury to the olfactory organ; and (3) remodeling and repair neuroplasticity mechanisms following injury and degeneration by olfactory toxicant exposure.

TI  - Neurotoxicological Profiling of Paraquat in Zebrafish Model
T2  - NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Paraquat is a polar herbicide protecting plant products against invasive species, it requires careful manipulation and restricted usage because of its harmful potentials. Exposure to paraquat triggers oxidative damage in dopaminergic neurons and subsequently causes a behavioral defect in vivo. Thereby, persistent exposure to paraquat is known to increase Parkinson's disease risk by dysregulating dopaminergic systems in humans. Therefore, most studies have focused on the dopaminergic systems to elucidate the neurotoxicological mechanism of paraquat poisoning, and more comprehensive neurochemistry including histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems has remained unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the toxicological potential of paraquat poisoning using a variety of approaches such as toxicokinetic profiles, behavioral effects, neural activity, and broad-spectrum neurochemistry in zebrafish larvae after short-term exposure to paraquat and we performed the molecular modeling approach. Our results showed that paraquat was slowly absorbed in the brain of zebrafish after oral administration of paraquat. In addition, paraquat toxicity resulted in behavioral impairments, namely, reduced motor activity and led to abnormal neural activities in zebrafish larvae. This locomotor deficit came with a dysregulation of dopamine synthesis induced by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, which was also indirectly confirmed by molecular modeling studies. Furthermore, short-term exposure to paraquat also caused simultaneous dysregulation of other neurochemistry including cholinergic and serotonergic systems in zebrafish larvae. The present study suggests that this neurotoxicological profiling could be a useful tool for understanding the brain neurochemistry of neurotoxic agents that might be a potential risk to human and environmental health.

TI  - Isoprocarb causes neurotoxicity of zebrafish embryos through oxidative stress-induced apoptosis
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Isoprocarb is a widely used carbamate insecticide in agriculture and aquaculture. Overuse of isoprocarb always leaves toxic residues in soil and water, however, the potential ecotoxicity of isoprocarb to organisms is still confusing. In this study, zebrafish embryo was used as a model to evaluate the toxicity of isoprocarb. Zebrafish embryos (96 hpf) were separately exposed at different concentrations of isoprocarb. The mortality rate, hatch-ability rate, average heart beat of the zebrafish embryo were separately calculated. Our results suggested that exposure to isoprocarb induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. HE staining showed that exposure to isoprocarb caused developmental defect in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos. As expected, the behavioral analysis also showed that the motor ability of zebrafish embryos were significantly inhibited following exposure to isoprocarb. In terms of mechanism, The expressions of genes involved in neurodevelopment signaling path-ways, such as foxo3a, gfap, syn2a, elavl3 and sox19b, were inhibited in zebrafish embryos after exposure to isoprocarb. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also reduced in isoprocarb-treated zebrafish embryos. Moreover, oxidative stress was induced by increasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme (SOD) after exposure to isoprocarb. Expectedly, acridine orange (AO) staining and the detection of some apoptosis-related genes revealed that oxidative stress resulted in apoptosis. In short, the expressions of genes associated with the neurodevelopmental signaling pathway are inhibited, and oxidative stress is also induced in zebrafish embryos after exposure to isoprocarb, which may be the molecular basics of isoprocarb-induced neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos.

TI  - An In Vivo Zebrafish Screen Identifies Organophosphate Antidotes with Diverse Mechanisms of Action
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING
AB  - Organophosphates are a class of highly toxic chemicals that includes many pesticides and chemical weapons. Exposure to organophosphates, either through accidents or acts of terrorism, poses a significant risk to human health and safety. Existing antidotes, in use for over 50 years, have modest efficacy and undesirable toxicities. Therefore, discovering new organophosphate antidotes is a high priority. Early life stage zebrafish exposed to organophosphates exhibit several phenotypes that parallel the human response to organophosphates, including behavioral deficits, paralysis, and eventual death. Here, we have developed a high-throughput zebrafish screen in a 96-well plate format to find new antidotes that counteract organophosphate-induced lethality. In a pilot screen of 1200 known drugs, we identified 16 compounds that suppress organophosphate toxicity in zebrafish. Several in vitro assays coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling enabled determination of mechanisms of action for several of the antidotes, including reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cholinergic receptor antagonism, and inhibition of bioactivation. Therefore, the in vivo screen is capable of discovering organophosphate antidotes that intervene in distinct pathways. These findings suggest that zebrafish screens might be a broadly applicable approach for discovering compounds that counteract the toxic effects of accidental or malicious poisonous exposures.

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomics to resolve the cellular responses to octanoic acid in rotenone exposed zebrafish
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Ketosis is a potentially beneficial metabolic state for health especially in neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD). Medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT) have specific metabolic properties and they are described as ketogenic even without restriction of carbohydrate. Octanoic acid (C8) is the main MCT showing this effect. Rotenone is a neurotoxin that is used to induce experimental PD model. Rotenone inhibits mitochondrial respiratory complex 1 (MRC1) and causes reactive oxygen species formation. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomic methods enable discovering specific signaling events in special molecular pathways through identification and quantification of phosphoproteins. Signaling networks involved in rotenone-mediated biological processes and beneficial effects of MCTs on neurodegenerative diseases are not well understood. We aimed to gain comprehensive molecular perspective on the global phosphoproteome differences in rotenone-exposed zebrafish treated with octanoic acid. Raw files obtained from MS analysis were processed and searched against the Danio rerio protein database using SEQUEST-HT algorithm to identify and quantify phosphopeptides with 2,569 unique phosphoproteins and 4,161 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 2005 proteins. Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) family members were significantly lower in rotenone group. Phosphoproteins involved in ion binding (calcium, magnesium, zinc ion), oxygen binding, microtubule binding, ATP- and GTP-binding were among differentially expressed 347 proteins in rotenone group and they were reversed after octanoic acid treatments. Phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites were identified for future exploration of signaling pathways involved in rotenone toxicity. We believe our findings might help in the formulation of effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PD using ketogenic formulations involving MCTs. Practical applications Ketosis is a potentially beneficial metabolic state for health especially in neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD). Medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT) (C6-C12) have specific metabolic properties making them described as ketogenic even without restriction of carbohydrate. Octanoic acid (caprylic acid, C8) is the main MCT showing this effect. Our findings might help in the formulation of effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease using ketogenic formulations involving Medium-chain-triglycerides.

TI  - Parkinson's disease-like motor and non-motor symptoms in rotenone-treated zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The pesticide rotenone is widely used to produce Parkinson's disease (PD)-like symptoms in rodents, but few studies have examined whether rotenone-treated zebrafish can serve as an animal model of PD. Here, we report that 4 weeks of rotenone treatment induced motor and non-motor PD-like symptoms in adult zebrafish. Compared with control fish, rotenone-treated fish spent less time swimming at a fast speed, indicating a deficit in motor function. In the light-dark box test, rotenone-treated fish exhibited longer latencies to enter the dark compartment and spent more time in the light compartment, reflecting anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Furthermore, rotenone-treated fish showed less of an olfactory preference for amino acid, indicating olfactory dysfunction. These behavioral symptoms were associated with decreased levels of dopamine in the brains of rotenone-treated fish. Taken together, these results suggest that rotenone-treated zebrafish are a suitable model of PD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acute Exposure to Permethrin Modulates Behavioral Functions, Redox, and Bioenergetics Parameters and Induces DNA Damage and Cell Death in Larval Zebrafish
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
AB  - Permethrin (PM) is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide widely used as domestic repellent. Damage effects to nontarget organisms have been reported, particularly in the early stages of development. Studies indicate redox unbalance as secondary PM effect. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the acute PM effects on larval zebrafish. Larvae (6 days postfertilization) were exposed to PM (25-600 mu g/L) during 24 hours, and 50% lethal concentration was estimated. For subsequent assays, the sublethal PM concentrations of 25 and 50 mu g/L were used. PM increased anxiety-like behaviors according to the Novel Tank and Light-Dark tests. At the molecular level, PM induced increased ROS, which may be related to the increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis detected in PM-exposed organisms. In parallel, upregulation of the antioxidant system was detected after PM exposure, with increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities, and thiol levels. The increased of Nrf2 target genes and the activation of an electrophile response element-driven reporter Tg(EPRE:LUC-EGFP) suggest that the Nrf2 pathway can mediate a fast response to PM, leading to antioxidant amplification. By using high-resolution respirometry, we found that exposure to PM decreased the oxygen consumption in all respiratory stages, disrupting the oxidative phosphorylation and inhibiting the electron transfer system, leading to decrease in bioenergetics capacity. In addition, PM led to increases of residual oxygen consumption and changes in substrate control ratio. Glucose metabolism seems to be affected by PM, with increased lactate dehydrogenase and decreased citrate synthase activities. Taken together, our results demonstrated the adverse effects of acute sublethal PM concentrations during larval development in zebrafish, causing apparent mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating a potential mechanism to redox unbalance and oxidative stress, which may be linked to the detected cell death and alterations in normal behavior patterns caused by acute PM exposure.

T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent model system for assessing the effects of toxicant exposure on behavior and neurodevelopment. In the present study, we examined the effects of sub-chronic embryonic exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a ubiquitous anthropogenic pollutant, on anxiety-related behaviors. We found that exposure to the PCB mixture, Aroclor (A) 1254, from 2 to 26 h post-fertilization (hpf) induced two statistically significant behavioral defects in larvae at 7 days postfertilization (dpf). First, during 135 min of free swimming, larvae that had been exposed to 2 ppm, 5 ppm or 10 ppm A1254 exhibited enhanced thigmotaxis (edge preference) relative to control larvae. Second, during the immediately ensuing 15-min visual startle assay, the 5 ppm and 10 ppm PCB-exposed larvae reacted differently to a visual threat, a red `bouncing' disk, relative to control larvae. These results are consistent with the anxiogenic and attention-disrupting effects of PCB exposure documented in children, monkeys and rodents and merit further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Individual organisms of daphnia (Daphnia magna) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to diazinon at low concentrations. The transition probability matrix (TPM) and the emission probability matrix (EPM) were accordingly estimated by training with the HMM and were verified before and after the treatments with 10(-6) tolerance in 10(3) iterations. Structured property in behavioral changes was accordingly revealed to characterize dynamic processes in movement patterns. Parameters and sequences produced through the HMM training could be a suitable means of monitoring toxic chemicals in environment.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of reproductive toxicity induced by beta-cypermethrin in zebrafish
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Beta-cypermethrin, a type II synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in pest control. Several studies have demonstrated that beta-cypermethrin can affect the reproductive system of mammals. However, there is still a scarcity of information about the reproductive toxicity to fish induced by beta-cypermethrin and its molecular mechanism. Therefore, this study was conducted to address this scientific question, in which the adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 (blank control), 0 (acetone solvent control), 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mu g/L of beta-cypermethrin for 21 days. A decrease in cumulative egg production of zebrafish was observed, indicating that beta-cypermethrin had a negative impact on reproductive capacity of zebrafish. Regarding the histomorphological analysis of gonads, the delay of gonadal development was observed after exposure for 21 days. In addition, significant changes in plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) were found in zebrafish. Further exploration showed that the transcription levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis-related genes were remarkably changed, which corresponded well with the alterations of hormone levels. These results demonstrated that beta-cypermethrin might have an adverse effect on the reproduction system of zebrafish through delaying gonadal development, disturbing sex hormone secretion, and affecting HPG axis gene expression. This study suggests that beta-cypermethrin poses a potential threat to the reproduction of fish populations, and the toxicity assessment of beta-cypermethrin plays a vital role in the environmental risk assessment of pesticides.

TI  - Pharmacologic modeling of primary mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in zebrafish
T2  - NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease is a heterogeneous and highly morbid group of energy deficiency disorders for which no proven effective therapies exist. Robust vertebrate animal models of primary RC dysfunction are needed to explore the effects of variation in RC disease subtypes, tissue-specific manifestations, and major pathogenic factors contributing to each disorder, as well as their pre-clinical response to therapeutic candidates. We have developed a series of zebrafish (Danio rerio) models that inhibit, to variable degrees, distinct aspects of RC function, and enable quantification of animal development, survival, behaviors, and organ-level treatment effects as well as effects on mitochondrial biochemistry and physiology. Here, we characterize four pharmacologic inhibitor models of mitochondrial RC dysfunction in early larval zebrafish, including rotenone (complex I inhibitor), azide (complex IV inhibitor), oligomycin (complex V inhibitor), and chloramphenicol (mitochondrial translation inhibitor that leads to multiple RC complex dysfunction). A range of concentrations and exposure times of each RC inhibitor were systematically evaluated on early larval development, animal survival, integrated behaviors (touch and startle responses), organ physiology (brain death, neurologic tone, heart rate), and fluorescence-based analyses of mitochondrial physiology in zebrafish skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic RC inhibitor effects were validated by spectrophotometric analysis of Complex I, II and IV enzyme activities, or relative quantitation of ATP levels in larvae. Outcomes were prioritized that utilize in vivo animal imaging and quantitative behavioral assessments, as may optimally inform the translational potential of pre-clinical drug screens for future clinical study in human mitochondrial disease subjects. The RC complex inhibitors each delayed early embryo development, with short-term exposures of these three agents or chloramphenicol from 5 to 7 days post fertilization also causing reduced larval survival and organ-specific defects ranging from brain death, behavioral and neurologic alterations, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in skeletal muscle (rotenone), and/or cardiac edema with visible blood pooling (oligomycin). Remarkably, we demonstrate that treating animals with probucol, a nutrient-sensing signaling network modulating drug that has been shown to yield therapeutic effects in a range of other RC disease cellular and animal models, both prevented acute rotenone-induced brain death in zebrafish larvae, and significantly rescued early embryo developmental delay from either rotenone or oligomycin exposure. Overall, these zebrafish pharmacologic RC function inhibition models offer a unique opportunity to gain novel insights into diverse developmental, survival, organ-level, and behavioral defects of varying severity, as well as their individual response to candidate therapies, in a highly tractable and cost-effective vertebrate animal model system.

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The use of pesticides is a widely spread practice in Brazilian agriculture, and dispersion of these substances is an important factor for the fauna and flora. Atrazine is an endocrine disruptor in the xenoestrogen class that is used worldwide in agricultural practices. In Brazil, its use is permitted in several crops. Podocnemis expansa is a representative of the Testudines order that is the largest freshwater reptile of South America. Its distribution enables it to get in contact with molecules that are commonly used as pesticides, which may cause deleterious effects in target populations. In order to evaluate the possible effects of the exposure to atrazine on bone ontogeny of this species, eggs were artificially incubated in sand moistened with water contaminated with atrazine at concentrations equal to 0, 2, 20 or 200 mu g/L. Embryos were collected throughout incubation and submitted to diaphanization of soft tissues with potassium hydroxide (KOH); bones were stained with Alizarin red S and cartilages by Alcian blue. Embryos were evaluated for the presence of abnormalities during the different stages of pre-natal development of skeletal elements. No effect of atrazine was observed on bone development during the embryonic phase in P. expansa individuals, in the conditions of this study.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of fenbuconazole in zebrafish: Effects on mitochondrial respiration and locomotor behavior
T2  - TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Triazole fungicides are used to control the disease of cereal crops but may also cause adverse effects on nontarget organisms. There is a lack of toxicity data for some triazoles such as fenbuconazole in aquatic organisms. This research was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of fenbuconazole at environmentally relevant concentrations with attention on the mitochondria, antioxidant system, and locomotor activity in zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to one concentration of 5, 50, 200 or 500 ng/L fenbuconazole for 96 h. There was no effect on survival nor percentage of fish hatched, but exposure to 200 and 500 ng/L fenbuconazole resulted in malformation and hypoactivity in zebrafish. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of embryos were measured to determine if the fungicide impaired mitochondrial respiration. Exposure to 500 ng/L fenbuconazole reduced basal OCR and oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration in exposed fish. Fenbuconazole reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the activities of mitochondrial Complex II and III. Transcript levels of both sdhc and cyc1, each related to Complex II and III, were also altered in expression by fenbuconazole exposure, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in embryos. Fenbuconazole activated the antioxidant system, based upon both transcriptional and enzymatic data in zebrafish. Consistent with mitochondrial impairment, molecular docking confirmed a strong binding capacity of the fungicide at the Q(i) site of Complex III, revealing this complex is susceptible to fenbuconazole. This study reveals potential toxicity pathways related to fenbuconazole exposure in aquatic organisms; such data can improve risk assessments for triazole fungicides.

TI  - Properties of Kenaf Cellulose Nanofiber (CNF) as Potential Larvicide Nanocarrier and Its Acute Ecotoxicity against Daphnia Magna and Dania rerio
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS
AB  - The study investigates nonmodified kenaf cellulose nanofiber (CNF) physicochemical properties, loading capability, and its acute toxicity against Daphnia magna and Dania rerio concerning the dispersion stability behavior of the kenaf CNF as a potential larvicide nanocarrier. The physicochemical properties of kenaf CNF were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area and porosity, and zeta potential. The loading capability was assessed using various water volumes, and the acute ecotoxicity was determined following the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development test guidelines Test no. 202 and Test no. 203, respectively. Kenaf CNF is a fibrous high aspect ratio nanomaterial comprising a negatively charged hydroxyl group with moderate particle stability and high loading capability. With high dispersion stability in the freshwater environment's aquatic conditions, kenaf CNF did not cause abnormalities and mortality to the D. rerio and no acute immobilization against D. magna. The kenaf CNF could be a candidate to function as a larvicide nanocarrier with insignificant acute ecotoxicity. The EC50 and LC50 for D. magna and D. rerio were above 100 mg/L and classified as nonhazardous to the aquatic environment according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).

TI  - A comprehensive review of strobilurin fungicide toxicity in aquatic species: Emphasis on mode of action from the zebrafish model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Strobilurins are popular fungicides used in agriculture on a global scale. Due to their widespread use as agrochemicals, they can enter aquatic environments at concentrations that can elicit adverse effects in organisms. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding the toxic effects of strobilurin fungicides on aquatic species, including algal species, Daphnia magna, and fish species, to determine risk to aquatic organisms and ecosystems. Data show that the toxicities of strobilurins vary widely across aquatic species. Strobilurins bind cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III in fungi, and as such, research in aquatic species has focused on mitochondria-related endpoints following exposures to strobilurins. In fish, studies into the activities of mitochondrial complexes and the expression of genes involved in the electron transfer chain have been conducted, converging on the theme that mitochondrial complexes and their enzymes are impaired by strobilurins. In general, the order of toxicity of strobilurins for fish species are pyraoxystrobin > pyraclostrobin approximate to trifloxystrobin > picoxystrobin > kresoxim-methyl > fluoxastrobin > azoxystrobin. In addition to mitochondrial toxicity, studies also report genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption, and each of these events can potentially impact whole organism-level processes such as development, reproduction, and behavior. Screening data from the US Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast database supports the hypothesis that these fungicides may act as endocrine disruptors, and high throughput data suggest estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid hormone receptor beta can be activated by some strobilurins. It is recommended that studies investigate the potential for endocrine disruption by strobilurins more thoroughly in aquatic species. Based on molecular, physiological, and developmental outcomes, a proposed adverse outcome pathway is presented with complex III inhibition in the electron transfer chain as a molecular initiating event. This review comprehensively addresses sub-lethal toxicity mechanisms of strobilurin fungicides, important as the detection of strobilurins in aquatic environments suggests exposure risks in wildlife.

TI  - Effects of the chorion on the developmental toxicity of organophosphate esters in zebrafish embryos
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Many toxicological studies have utilized zebrafish embryos to investigate the developmental toxicity of organophosphate esters (OPEs). However, in respect of the presence or absence of the chorion, a consistent experimental methodology has yet to be developed. In this study, we used a fixed exposure scheme to compare the developmental toxicities of six major OPEs in chorionated and dechorionated zebrafish embryos. Removal of the chorion increased sensitivity to OPEs: we found higher incidence of mortality and malformation in dechorionated embryos. In a behavioral assay, the locomotive activity of zebrafish larvae was consistently inhibited by OPEs except tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate regardless of chorion presence. However, at the molecular level, the expression of ZHE1 and mmp9 was affected by the presence of the chorion in zebrafish embryos exposed to tributyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), respectively. Furthermore, in zebrafish embryos exposed to TPHP, the increased expression of miR-137 and miR-141 was abolished by the presence of the chorion. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the presence of the chorion influences phenotypic morbidity, organismal behavior, and gene expression in zebrafish embryos exposed to chemicals; thus, we suggest that dechorionation is desirable for exploring the toxicity mechanisms that underlie effects of chemical exposure.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of glyphosate on embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Glyphosate (GLY) induces developmental toxicity in fish, but research on the toxicity mechanism is limited. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed for 120 hpf to 0.7, 7, and 35 mg L-1 GLY. The results show that GLY treatment induced developmental toxicity in the fish, including premature hatching, reduced heartbeats, pericardial and yolk sac oedema, swim bladder deficiency, and shortened body length, which was possibly due to a significantly decreased triiodothyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4) ratio and the abnormal expression patterns of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) (crh, tsh beta, tr alpha, tr beta, and t tr ) and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis-related genes (gh, ghr alpha, ghr beta, igf1, igf1r alpha, and igf1r beta) in larvae exposed to GLY. In addition, GLY exposure altered the levels of SOD and CAT, increased ROS, promoted malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and significantly altered the levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling pathway factors (perk, eif2 alpha, gadd34, atf4, ire1 alpha, xbp1, atf6, hspa5, and chop), suggesting that GLY treatment induced oxidative injury and ER stress in the larvae. Further research showed that treatment with a higher concentration of GLY upregulated the levels of iNOS, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha while inhibiting the expression of IL-10 and TGF-beta, suggesting that GLY causes an inflammatory reaction in the larvae. In addition, we also found that apoptosis was induced in the larvae, which was determined by acridine orange staining and abnormal expression of p53, caspase-3,-8, and-9. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GLY exposure altered the T3/T4 ratio, disturbed the expression patterns of HPT and GH/IGF axis-related genes, and induced oxidative and ER stress, inflammatory reactions, and apoptosis in the zebrafish larvae. This investigation contributes to improved understanding of the developmental toxicity mechanism of GLY in fish.

TI  - Behavioral changes occur earlier than redox alterations in developing zebrafish exposed to Mancozeb
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - As agriculture expands to provide food and wellbeing to the world's growing population, there is a simultaneous increasing concern about the use of agrochemicals, which can harm non-target organisms, mainly in the aquatic environment. The fungicide Mancozeb (MZ) has been used on a large-scale and is a potent inducer of oxidative stress. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of more sensitive biomarkers designed to earlier biomonitoring of this compound. Here we tested the hypothesis that behavioral changes induced by sublethal MZ concentrations would occur first as compared to biochemical oxidative stress markers. Embryos at 4 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to Mancozeb at 5, 10 and 20 mu g/L. Controls were kept in embryo water only. Behavioral and biochemical parameters were evaluated at 24, 28, 72, and 168 hpf after MZ exposure. The results showed that MZ significantly altered spontaneous movement, escape responses, swimming capacity, and exploratory behavior at all exposure times. However, changes in ROS steady-stead levels and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were observable only at 72 and 168 hpf. In conclusion, behavioral changes occurred earlier than biochemical alterations in zebrafish embryos exposed to MZ, highlighting the potential of behavioral biomarkers as sensitive tools for biomonitoring programs.

TI  - The Toxic Effects of Glyphosate, Chlorpyrifos, Abamectin, and 2,4-D on Animal Models: A Systematic Review of Brazilian Studies
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Brazil is a global agricultural commodity producer and the largest consumer of pesticides. Pesticide use in Brazil comprised 549 280 tons in 2018. In the country, soybean, corn, and sugar cane are extensively produced, which are the most pesticides demanding crops. In the last years, the records of new pesticides were the highest in the historical series. They can persist in soil or water, accumulate in organisms, and contaminate workers and the general population through the air, water, or food. This review aimed to gather toxicological data obtained by animal models exposed to 4 pesticides: glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, abamectin, and 2,4-D. An additional goal was to compose an overview of how this subject has been approached, surveying which research groups are working on this field, where they are located, and relations with pesticides used in those regions. We collected the papers from the platforms PubMed, Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science, performed in Brazil from 2014 to 2019. After two-step blind selection using the software Rayyan QCRI by different authors, 67 studies were selected to extract data. We observed that research is more concentrated in the South region, followed by the Southeast and Midwest, with 43%, 32%, and 23% of the studies, respectively. The prevalent institutions are from the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo, and Goias. The effects on a variety of biomarkers help predict the potential risks to humans and nontarget organisms. The prevalent animal model was fish (36%). Overall, the main toxic effects evaluated were mortality, abnormalities in the blood cells, developmental abnormalities, and behavior alterations.

TI  - Enantioselectivity in biotransformation and bioaccumulation processes of typical chiral contaminants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Chirality is a critical topic in the medicinal and agrochemical fields. One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present review, we highlight state-of-the knowledge on the stereoselective biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans. Chiral insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pharmaceuticals, flame retardants hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are all included in the target compounds. Key findings included: a) Changes in the enantiomeric fractions in vitro and in vivo models revealed that enantioselectivity commonly occurs in biotransformation and bioaccumulation. b) Emerging contaminants have become more important in the field of enantioselectivity together with their metabolites in biological transformation process. c) Chiral signatures have also been regarded as powerful tools for tracking pollution sources when the contribution of precursor is unknown. Future studies are needed in order to understand not only preliminary enrichment results but also detailed molecular mechanisms in diverse models to comprehensively understand the behaviours of chiral compounds.

TI  - Combining short-term bioassays using fish and crustacean model organisms with ToxCast in vitro data and broad-spectrum chemical analysis for environmental risk assessment of the river water (Sava, Croatia)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - This study focused on the short-term whole organism bioassays (WOBs) on fish (Danio rerio) and crustaceans (Gammarus fossarum and Daphnia magna) to assess the negative biological effects of water from the major European River Sava and the comparison of the obtained results with in vitro toxicity data (ToxCast database) and Risk Quotient (RQ) methodology. Pollution profiles of five sampling sites along the River Sava were assessed by simultaneous chemical analysis of 562 organic contaminants (OCs) of which 476 were detected. At each sampling site, pharmaceuticals/illicit drugs category was mostly represented by their cumulative concentration, followed by categories industrial chemicals, pesticides and hormones. An exposure-activity ratio (EAR) approach based on ToxCast data highlighted steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antiepileptics/neuroleptics, industrial chemicals and hormones as compounds with the highest biological potential. Summed EAR-based prediction of toxicity showed a good correlation with the estimated toxicity of assessed sampling sites using WOBs. WOBs did not exhibit increased mortality but caused various sub-lethal biological responses that were dependant relative to the sampling site pollution intensity as well as species sensitivity. Exposure of G. fossarum and D. magna to river water-induced lower feeding rates increased GST activity and TBARS levels. Zebrafish D. rerio embryo exhibited a significant decrease in heartbeat rate, failure in pigmentation formation, as well as inhibition of ABC transporters. Nuclear receptor activation was indicated as the biological target of greatest concern based on the EAR approach. A combined approach of short-term WOBs, with a special emphasis on sublethal endpoints, and chemical characterization of water samples compared against in vitro toxicity data from the ToxCast database and RQs can provide a comprehensive insight into the negative effect of pollutants on aquatic organisms.

TI  - Developmental exposure to the A6-pesticide causes changes in tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression, neurochemistry, and locomotors behavior in larval zebrafish
T2  - TOXICOLOGY MECHANISMS AND METHODS
AB  - Purpose: In recent years, the increase in the biopesticides synthesis for alternative agricultural uses has required their impacts study. Among these compounds, several of them are known to exert endocrinedisrupting (EDs) effects causing deregulation of physiological functions affecting cell signaling pathways involved in neural cell differentiation leading to developmental neurotoxicity. The objective of our study was to determine the impact of the biopesticide A6 structurally related to estrogenic EDs on zebrafish larvae, to define its toxicity, the mechanisms responsible, and to monitor the locomotors activity at nanomolar concentrations (0. 0.5, 5 and 50 nM). Materials and methods: Using imaging analysis tools, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and an automated behavior recording system (Zebrabox) we were able to assess these effects. Results: We have shown through its blue fluorescence properties that it accumulates in different parts of the body such as the intestine, adipose tissue, muscles, yolk sac and head. A6 also disrupted swimming behavior by affecting the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in dopaminergic neurons. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study provided a mechanistic understanding of the A6 neurotoxic effect which could be the result of its binding to the estrogen receptor.

TI  - Fluorescent Transgenic Zebrafish Tg(nkx2.2a:mEGFP) Provides a Highly Sensitive Monitoring Tool for Neurotoxins
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Previously a standard toxicological test termed as DarT (Danio rerio Teratogenic assay) using wild type zebrafish embryos has been established and it is widely applied in toxicological and chemical screenings. As an increasing number of fluorescent transgenic zebrafish lines with specific fluorescent protein expression specifically expressed in different organs and tissues, we envision that the fluorescent markers may provide more sensitive endpoints for monitoring chemical induced phenotypical changes. Here we employed Tg(nkx2.2a:mEGFP) transgenic zebrafish which have GFP expression in the central nervous system to investigate its potential for screening neurotoxic chemicals. Five potential neurotoxins (acetaminophen, atenolol, atrazine, ethanol and lindane) and one neuroprotectant (mefenamic acid) were tested. We found that the GFP-labeled ventral axons from trunk motoneurons, which were easily observed in live fry and measured for quantification, were a highly sensitive to all of the five neurotoxins and the length of axons was significantly reduced in fry which looked normal based on DarT endpoints at low concentrations of neurotoxins. Compared to the most sensitive endpoints of DarT, ventral axon marker could improve the detection limit of these neurotoxins by about 10 fold. In contrast, there was no improvement for detection of the mefenamic acid compared to all DarT endpoints. Thus, ventral axon lengths provide a convenient and measureable marker specifically for neurotoxins. Our study may open a new avenue to use other fluorescent transgenic zebrafish embryos/fry to develop sensitive and specific toxicological tests for different categories of chemicals.

TI  - Bifenthrin exposure causes hyperactivity in early larval stages of an endangered fish species at concentrations that occur during their hatching season
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Bifenthrin is a pyrethmid insecticide commonly used in agricultural and urban sectors, and is found in watersheds worldwide. As a sodium channel blocker, at sublethal concentrations it causes off-target effects, including disruption of calcium signaling and neuronal growth. At the whole organism level, sublethal concentrations of bifenthrin cause behavioral effects in fish species, raising concerns about the neumtoxic properties of the compound on fish populations. Here we describe the application of a high-throughput behavioral system to evaluate contaminant impacts on the sensitive early-life stages of Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered teleost species endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD), California, USA. Leveraging the natural behavior of early-larval Delta smelt, whereby they increase movement in bright light and decrease movement in the dark, we developed a test using a cycle of light and dark periods in a closed chamber to test hyper- or hypoactivity for this species. We show that early-larval Delta smelt have a significant preference to move toward light, and utilized the behavioral test to evaluate the impact of exposure to bifenthrin at concentrations found in habitats where Delta smelt reportedly spawn, ranging up to concentrations detected in tributaries to these habitats. All tested concentrations of bifenthrin (nominal 2, 10, or 100 ng/L) caused hyperactivity, over a 96 h exposure, with noted significance determined during the light period of the test. To further understand the impact of bifenthrin exposure, expression of a suite of genes relevant to neurodevelopment, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and biotransformation in exposed larvae were also measured. Following exposure to picomolar concentrations of bifenthrin, expression of genes in the mTOR signaling and neurogenesis pathways were altered alongside behavior. This study demonstrates how light and dark cycle behavioral tests can be used to assess sensitive alterations in swimming activity in Delta smelt at early developmental stages and how gene expression can complement these assays. This approach can be used to assess the impact of multiple compounds that occur within the restricted habitat of Delta smelt, thus having the potential to greatly inform conservation management strategies for this critically sensitive life stage.

TI  - Deltamethrin induces apoptosis in cerebrum neurons of quail via promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Deltamethrin (DLM) is a widely used and highly effective insecticide. DLM exposure is harmful to animal and human. Quail, as a bird model, has been widely used in the field of toxicology. However, there is little information available in the literature about quail cerebrum damage caused by DLM. Here, we investigated the effect of DLM on quail cerebrum neurons. Four groups of healthy quails were assigned (10 quails in each group), respectively given 0, 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg DLM by gavage for 12 weeks. Through the measurements of quail cerebrum, it was found that DLM exposure induced obvious histological changes, oxidative stress, and neurons apoptosis. To further explore the possible molecular mechanisms, we performed real-time quantitative PCR to detect the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related mRNA such as glucose regulated protein 78 kD, activating transcription factor 6, inositol requiring enzyme, and protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase. In addition, we detected ATP content in quail cerebrum to evaluate the functional status of mitochondria. The study showed that DLM exposure significantly increased the expression of ER stress-related mRNA and decreased ATP content in quail cerebrum tissues. These results suggest that chronic exposure to DLM induces apoptosis of quail cerebrum neurons via promoting ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, our results provide a novel explanation for DLM-induced apoptosis of avian cerebrum neurons.

TI  - Effect of acute exposure of triazophos on histological structure and apoptosis of the brain and liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Triazophos (TAP) has become a part of widespread pollutant of the aquatic environment due to its residue. Current study was designed to investigate the toxic effect of TAP at different doses (0.06, 0.3 and 1.5 mg/L) to the model organism of zebrafish (Dario rerio) by using multi-endpoint analysis in a 96 h acute exposure test. The direct observation that histological and ultrastructural alteration of zebrafish brain and liver were carried out via paraffin section in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. In addition, a series of methods were applied for exploring the physiological parameters related to cellular apoptosis. Results indicated that vacuolar structure after 96 h treatment with TAP were appeared in the molecular and granular layers of cerebellum. A large number of nuclear retraction, tissues vacuolation and cytoplasmic loss were observed in liver at histological level. From the fine structural level, the mitochondrial vacuolation and membrane damage of brain cells were found and the cristae of mitochondria disintegrated partly in hepatocytes. Onset of such histological structure alterations were one of the most intuitive reflection to TAP exposure, which needs to analyze biochemical alterations for further study. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) showed a downward trend in the brain and liver of zebrafish. Simultaneously, the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased after 96 h exposure with a concentration-dependent manner, which could be served as a suitable indicator of cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis-related genes (Apaf-1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9) transcription showed different alterations in response to the TAP treatment. These results indicated that TAP exposure led to apoptosis in zebrafish brain and liver and it was speculated that the apoptosis may occur through mitochondrial pathway. The present study demonstrated that the exposure of zebrafish to the insecticide TAP led to observe its effects at both histological structure and apoptosis level in liver and brain.

TI  - Hypo- or hyperactivity of zebrafish embryos provoked by neuroactive substances: a review on how experimental parameters impact the predictability of behavior changes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB  - Tests with zebrafish embryos have gained wide acceptance as an alternative test model for drug development and toxicity testing. In particular, the behavioral response of the zebrafish embryo is currently seen as a useful endpoint to diagnose neuroactive substances. Consequently, several behavioral test methods have been developed addressing various behavioral endpoints such as spontaneous tail coiling (STC), photomotor response (PMR), locomotor response (LMR) and alternating light/dark-induced locomotor response (LMR-L/D). Although these methods are distinct in their application, most of their protocols differ quite strongly in the use of experimental parameters and this is usually driven by different research questions. However, if a single mode of action is to be diagnosed, then varying experimental parameters may cause incoherent behavioral responses (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish during toxicity assessment. This could lead to inconclusiveness of behavioral test results for use within a prospective and diagnostic risk assessment framework. To investigate the influence of these parameters, we conducted a review of existing behavioral assays to address the following two questions: (1) To what extent do varying experimental parameters influence observed effects in published behavioral test methods? (2) Is the observed behavior change (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish embryos consistent with the expected mode of action of a chemical? We compiled a set of 18 substances which are anticipated to be neuroactive. We found that behavioral changes are not only affected by chemicals but also variation in the use of experimental parameters across studies seems to have a high impact on the outcome and thus comparability between studies. Four parameters, i.e., exposure concentration, exposure duration, endpoint parameter and developmental stage were the most influential parameters. Varying combinations of these parameters caused a non-reproducible outcome for the hyperactivity expected for the organophosphates; chlorpyrifos and diazinon. We highlighted that the STC test shows a higher capacity to predict the hyperactivity of organophosphates, while PMR and LMR-L/D were more suitable to predict the hypoactivity expected for anticonvulsants. We provide a list of recommendations which, when implemented, may help to exclude the risk of bias due to experimental parameters if similar goals are desired.

Even though numerous authors have intensively studied its toxicity, only limited information concerning the long-term fish exposure is available. The aim of this study was evaluation of chronic exposure in common carp. Fish were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations (0.3 - environmentally relevant concentration; 300; 1000; and 3000 mu g/l) for twelve weeks. The potential impact of atrazine exposure was studied using various markers (behaviour; biometrical characteristics; haematological, biochemical and oxidative stress indices and histopathological changes). Most alterations were recorded at the highest concentration (3000 mu g/l) which is probably due to a combined effect of both the herbicide exposure and intensive parasite infection development during second week. This group was cancelled after three weeks due to adverse health status, which partly confirmed atrazine immunotoxicity. Chronic exposure resulted in long-term reduction in feed intake followed by a significant decrease in body weight and morphological changes in gill at 1000 mu g/l. At the same concentration, significant alterations in haematological (e.g. increase in erythrocyte, leukocyte, lymphocytes and neutrophil counts as well as decrease in monocyte counts) and biochemical (e.g. changes in enzyme activities; increase in glucose; decrease in ammonia) indices were documented, especially during first three weeks. Similar trend, but not so intensive, was observed at 300 mu g/l. Moreover, significant changes were observed in various indicators of oxidative stress. These alterations were highly variable with both increasing and decreasing trends depending on dose and analysed tissue. Significant changes, especially in white blood profile, enzyme activities and oxidative stress indices, were proven even at 0.3 mu g/l. Obtained results indicate that chronic atrazine exposure of common carp can negatively influence many indicators of health status such as behaviour, immune response, haematological and biochemical profile, oxidative stress indices and organ histopathology.

TI  - Abamectin induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity within early zebrafish embryos
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - During early zebrafish embryogenesis, spontaneous tail contractions represent the first sign of locomotion and result from innervation of primary motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on a high-content screen, we previously demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish embryos to abamectin - an avermectin insecticide - from 5-25 hours post-fertilization (hpf) abolished spontaneous activity in the absence of effects on survival and gross morphology. Therefore, the objective of this study was to begin investigating the mechanism of abamectin-induced hypoactivity in zebrafish. Similar to 384-well plates, static exposure of embryos to abamectin from 5-25 hpf in glass beakers resulted in elimination of activity at low micromolar concentrations. However, abamectin did not affect neurite outgrowth from spinal motoneurons and, compared with exposure from 5-25 hpf, embryos were equally susceptible to abamectin-induced hypoactivity when exposures were initiated at 10 and 23 hpf. Moreover, immersion of abamectin-exposed embryos in clean water resulted in complete recovery of spontaneous activity relative to vehicle controls, suggesting that abamectin reversibly activated ligand-gated chloride channels and inhibited neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated embryos to vehicle or non-toxic concentrations of fipronil or endosulfan - two insecticides that antagonize the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor - from 5-23 hpf, and then exposed embryos to vehicle or abamectin from 23-25 hpf. Interestingly, activity levels within abamectin-exposed embryos pretreated with either antagonist were similar to embryos exposed to vehicle alone. Using quantitative PCR and phylogenetic analyses, we then confirmed the presence of GABA receptor alpha 1 and beta 2 subunits at 5, 10, and 23 hpf, and demonstrated that zebrafish GABA receptor subunits are homologous to mammalian GABA receptor subunits. Overall, our data collectively suggest that abamectin induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity within early zebrafish embryos, an effect that may be mediated through the GABA receptor.

TI  - N-acetylcysteine inhibits Mancozeb-induced impairments to the normal development of zebrafish embryos
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Mancozeb (MZ), a manganese/zinc-containing ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (EBCD) fungicide has been claimed to present low acute toxicity and short environmental persistence, however, its effects on embryogenesis in nontarget organisms is unclear. Here, we used zebrafish embryos (5hpf) to assess the potential embryotoxic effects induced by MZ (up to 72hpf) as well as the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process by pre-treatment with a classical antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine, NAC). Markers of reactive oxygen species production (ROS), glutathione (GSH) levels and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were measured along with genotoxicity (comet assay), cell death (Acridine Orange) and behavioral parameters (spontaneous movement, touch stimulation and swimming response), in order to determine potential mechanisms of embryotoxicity. According to results, MZ was able to induce morphological abnormalities such as body axis distortion, DNA damage, cell death, increased ROS generation and changes in behavioral endpoints during zebrafish development. All these toxic effects were inhibited by the pre-treatment with NAC indicating a key role of redox unbalance during MZ-induced embryotoxicity. At least in our knowledge, this is the first report on the deleterious effect of MZ to the normal embryogenesis of zebrafish. In addition, the importance of ROS generation during this pathophysiological condition was highlighted.

TI  - Enantioselective bioaccumulation and toxicity of rac-sulfoxaflor in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sulfoxaflor isa fourth-generation neonicotinoid insecticide mainly used to control sap-feeding pests. In this study, four stereoisomers of sulfoxaflor were separated using HPLC, and the absolute configurations of three stereoisomers were identified via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. First, the stability and isomerization of the four enantiomers and rac- sulfoxaflor in water and seven organic solvents were investigated. All enantiomers were extremely unstable in water with isomerization rates above 20%. The racemate did not isomerize in any of the solutions and was stable in water (degradation rate less than 7%). Therefore, we studied the acute toxicity, enantioselective behavior, and enzymatic activities of rac-sulfoxaflor in zebrafish. The bioaccumulation experiment demonstrated that the bioconcentration of sulfoxaflor in zebrafish was enantioselective, and the four enantiomers accumulated in zebrafish in the order (+)-2S,3S-sulfoxaflor (-)-2R,3R-sulfoxaflor > (+)-2R,3S-sulfoxaflor > (-)-2S,3R-sulfoxaflor. The effect of rac- sulfoxaflor on the enzymatic activities of zebrafish showed that superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities and malondialdehyde content were significantly enhanced as compared to those in control, whereas acetylcholinesterase was significantly reduced in the sulfoxaflor exposure treatment (p < 0.05), indicating that sulfoxaflor caused oxidative lesions and induced enzymatic activity in zebrafish. This study provides important information on the enantioselective behavior and toxic effects of sulfoxaflor, which can help assess the potential ecological risk of chiral pesticides to aquatic organisms.

TI  - Neurobehavioral impairments caused by developmental imidacloprid exposure in zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides are becoming more widely applied as organophosphate (OP) insecticides are decreasing in use. Because of their relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of vertebrates to neonicotinoids. Methods: Using zebrafish, we investigated the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 mu M or 60 mu M of imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4 h to 5 d post fertilization. The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidadoprid and nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and-during adolescence and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank swimming, and shoaling behavior. Results: In larvae, developmental imidadoprid exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidadoprid than the AB* strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming, it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling stimulus. Discussion: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of toxicological effects and recovery patterns in zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to phosalone-based and cypermethrin-based pesticides
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - This study evaluated the toxic effects and recovery patterns in zebrafish (Danio redo) after exposure to phosalone-based (PBP) and cypermethrin-based (CBP) pesticides. Initially, the 96 h LC50 values of the pesticides were calculated as being 5.35 mu g of active ingredient (AI) L-1 for CBP and 217 mu g AI L-1 for PBP based on measured concentrations. Accordingly, experimental groups were exposed to three sublethal concentrations of pesticides for 96 h, separately, and then zebrafish were transferred to pesticide-free conditions for 10 and 20 days recovery periods. Biochemical markers were assessed including carboxylesterase (CaE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST) activities after the exposure and recovery periods. Also, the pesticide concentrations in test water were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Our results showed that AChE and CaE activities were significantly inhibited and GST was induced by both pesticides after 96 h exposure. For PBP exposure, the decreases for GST induction and CaE inhibition showed a partial recovery in pesticide-free conditions. However, the decreases in AChE activity for CBP exposure and insufficient increases in same enzyme activity for PBP exposure after 20 days in pesticide-free conditions indicated that the projected recovery period was not enough to the recovery of AChE activities and for the improvement of fish health.

TI  - Developmental exposure to low concentrations of two brominated flame retardants, BDE-47 and BDE-99, causes life-long behavioral alterations in zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants until the early 2000s, mainly in home furnishings and electronics. The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2',4,4',5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2',4,4',-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 mu M CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mu M BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3,1, 3,10, 20 mu M BDE-99 from 5 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance. Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3 mu M CPF and 0.1 mu M BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 mu M causing hyperactivity and 1 mu M or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test. Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Quantitation and prediction of sorptive losses during toxicity testing of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and nitrated PAH (NPAH) using polystyrene 96-well plates
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Developing zebrafish are increasingly being used for rapid assessments of chemical toxicity, and these assays are frequently conducted in multi-well plastic plates. This study investigated the sorptive behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) to uncoated 96-well polystyrene plates typically used for zebrafish (Danio rerio) testing. We measured the percent sorption in the presence and absence of zebrafish embryos, at two exposure concentrations, as well as using two-different procedures (addition of embryos to polystyrene plates either before analyte addition, or allowing 24 h of equilibrium between analyte addition and embryo addition to the polystyrene plates). Following exposure, the plates were extracted with hexane and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Allowing 24 h of pre-incubation between the addition of analytes and embryos did not significantly impact the percent sorption. The percent sorption was higher for both PAHs and NPAHs at the lower exposure concentration, and sorption was lower in the presence of zebrafish embryos. A mass balance model was developed to predict the sorption to polystyrene plates, based on the PAH and NPAH mass distribution ratios between polystyrene and water. While PAH sorption was significantly correlated with subcooled liquid solubility, NPAH sorption did not correlate with any of the physical-chemical properties investigated. This indicates the need to better understand the sorptive behavior of hydrophobic analytes to plastics, and to better account for sorptive losses during toxicity testing in polystyrene plates.

TI  - Combined effects of chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin on neurobehavior and neurotransmitter levels in larval zebrafish
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin are insecticides commonly used in agriculture. The mixed residues of chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin in the aquatic environment may have combined effects on nontarget species. Therefore, studying the combined toxic effects and mechanisms of pesticide mixtures is of great significance to environmental risk assessment. To evaluate the risk of combined exposure, we examined the effects of both compounds, separately and together, on motor activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and neurotransmitter levels in larval zebrafish. Chlorpyrifos exposure significantly reduced functional motor capacity (swim distance and velocity) and enhanced meandering, while cyfluthrin exposure alone had no significant effects on swim parameters. However, combined exposure significantly reduced total swimming distance and mean velocity and increased meandering. Both compounds alone and the combination significantly reduced AChE activity, and the combined effect was antagonistic. Combined exposure also significantly altered the concentrations of serotonin, serotonin precursors, and dopamine precursors, as well as concentrations of the amino acid neurotransmitters glycine, alanine, and aspartic acid. Combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin exhibited distinct joint action modes in terms of neurobehavior, AChE activity, and neurotransmitter levels, thereby providing an experimental basis for assessing the combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin's environmental risk.

TI  - Paraquat exposure induces behavioral deficits in larval zebrafish during the window of dopamine neurogenesis
T2  - TOXICOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Exposure to environmental risk factors such as herbicides in early life has been proposed to play important roles in the development of neurodegenerative disorders in adult life. To test this hypothesis, we used a zebrafish model to link the herbicide paraquat (PQ) to disease etiology. Strikingly, treatment of 18 hpf embryonic zebrafish with low-dose PQ treatment (0.04 ppm, lower than the accepted human daily exposure) resulted in 50% display of neurodegenerative phenotypes and motor deficits at various developmental stages (segmentation to larval stage). Wide arrays of biomarkers have been employed to delineate the toxic responses which include lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) and apoptosis studies. A decrease in the GSH levels, increase in lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, respectively, were observed at various developmental stages. Unexpectedly, we show that the exposure to paraquat during the window of dopamine neurogenesis causes Parkinsonian like motor defects in later life by perturbing cholinergic system due to oxidative stress.

TI  - Critical duration of exposure for developmental chlorpyrifos-induced neurobehavioral toxicity
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Developmental exposure of rats to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) causes persistent neurobehavioral impairment. In a parallel series of studies with zebrafish, we have also found persisting behavioral dysfunction after developmental CPF exposure. We have developed a battery of measures of zebrafish behavior, which are reliable and sensitive to toxicant-induced damage. This study determined the critical duration of developmental CPF exposure for causing persisting neurobehavioral effects. Tests of sensorimotor response (tap startle response and habituation), stress response (novel tank diving test) and learning (3-chamber tank spatial discrimination) were conducted with adult zebrafish after early developmental CPF exposure. The CPF exposure level was 100 ng/ml with durations of 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 and 0-5 days after fertilization. Developmental CPF exposure had persisting behavioral effects in zebrafish tested as adults. In the tactile startle test, CPF exposed fish showed decreased habituation to startle and a trend toward increased overall startle response. In the novel tank exploration test, exposed fish showed decreased escape diving response and increased swimming activity. In the 3-chamber learning test, the 0-5 day CPF exposure group had a significantly lower learning rate. There was evidence for persisting declines in brain dopamine and norepinepherine levels after developmental CPF exposure. In all of the measures the clearest persistent effects were seen in fish exposed for the full duration of five days after fertilization. In a follow-up experiment there were some indications for persisting behavioral effects after exposure during only the later phase of this developmental window. This study demonstrated the selective long-term neurobehavioral alterations caused by exposure to CPF in zebrafish. The zebrafish model can facilitate the determination of the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term neurobehavioral impairment after developmental toxicant exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Age matters: Developmental stage of Danio rerio larvae influences photomotor response thresholds to diazinion or diphenhydramine
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Because basic toxicological data is unavailable for the majority of industrial compounds, High Throughput Screening (HTS) assays using the embryonic and larval zebrafish provide promising approaches to define bioactivity profiles and identify potential adverse outcome pathways for previously understudied chemicals. Unfortunately, standardized approaches, including HTS experimental designs, for examining fish behavioral responses to contaminants are rarely available. In the present study, we examined movement behavior of larval zebrafish over 7 days (4-10 days post fertilization or dpf) during typical daylight workday hours to determine whether intrinsic activity differed with age and time of day. We then employed an early life stage approach using the Fish Embryo Test (FET) at multiple developmental ages to evaluate whether photomotor response (PMR) behavior differed with zebrafish age following exposure to diazinon (DZN), a well-studied orthophosphate insecticide, and diphenhydramine (DPH), an antihistamine that also targets serotonin reuptake transporters and the acetylcholine receptor. 72 h studies were conducted at 1-4, 4-7 and 7-10 dpf, followed by behavioral observations using a ViewPoint system at 4, 7 and 10 dpf. Distance traveled and swimming speeds were quantified; nominal treatment levels were analytically verified by isotope-dilution LC-MSMS. Larval zebrafish locomotion displayed significantly different (p < 0.05) activity profiles over the course of typical daylight and workday hours, and these time of day PMR activity profiles were similar across ages examined (4-10 dpf). 10 dpf zebrafish larvae were consistently more sensitive to DPH than either the 4 or 7 dpf larvae with an environmentally realistic lowest observed effect concentration of 200 ng/L. Though ELS and FET studies with zebrafish typically focus on mortality or teratogenicity in 0-4 dpf organisms, behavioral responses of slightly older fish were several orders of magnitude more sensitive to DPH. Our observations highlight the importance of understanding the influence of time of day on intrinsic locomotor activity, and the age-specific hazards of aquatic contaminants to fish behavior.

TI  - Pyridaben induced cardiotoxicity during the looping stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Pyridaben is a widely used acaricide in agriculture and reaches a high concentration (97 mu g/L) in paddy water for a short time when pyridaben was applied to rice. However, its toxicity to aquatic organisms is still poorly understood. Therefore, we assessed the pyridaben cardiotoxicity to aquatic organisms using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. We found that pyridaben is highly toxic to aquatic organisms, and LC50 of pyridaben for zebrafish at 72 hpf was 100.6 mu g/L. Pyridaben caused severe cardiac malformations and functional abnormalities. Morphologic abnormity included severe pericardial edema, cardiomegaly, decreased cardiomyocytes, thinning of the myocardial layer, linear heart, and increased the distance between sinus venous and bulbus arteriosus (SVBA). Functional failure included arrhythmia, heart failure, and reduced pumping efficiency. The genes involved in heart development, WNT signaling, BMP signaling, ATPase, and cardiac troponin C were abnormally expressed in the pyridaben treatment group. Exposure to pyridaben increased oxidative stress and induced cell apoptosis. The above causes may lead to cardiac toxicity. The results suggest that pyridaben exposure induced elevated oxidative stress through the WNT signaling pathway, which in turn led to apoptosis in the heart and cardiotoxicity. Besides, pyridaben exposure at the critical stage of cardiac looping (24-36 hpf) resulted in the greatest cardiotoxicity. The chorion reduced the entry of pyridaben and protected zebrafish embryos, resulting in cardiotoxicity second only to the stage of cardiac looping. The study should provide valuable information that pyridaben exposure causes cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and have potential health risks for other aquatic organisms and humans.

TI  - Chronic exposure to environmentally realistic levels of diuron impacts the behaviour of adult marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Diuron, a commonly used herbicide and antifouling biocide, has been frequently detected in seawater. The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups. These findings highlight the significant neumtoxic effects of diumn and the extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain. More broadly, this study reveals the ecological risk associated with environmentally realistic levels of diuron in marine animals.

AB  - An efficient trace detection method for the determination of residues of the glufosinate enantiomers and metabolites in zebrafish by HPLC???Q-Exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry was developed. After the purification of dichloromethane and Oasis PRiME HLB SPE column, the recovery ranges from 77% to 104%, with RSD < 10.03%. The limits of quantitation in zebrafish were 0.006???0.02 mg/kg. The results revealed zebrafish absorbed glufosinate slowly, reaching a steady state in 10???14 days, and the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of D/Lglufosinate-ammonium was less than 0.3. L-glufosinate-ammonium accumulated preferentially in zebrafish. The residue of the metabolite N-acetyl glutamate (NAG) was smaller than that of 3-methyl phosphonic acid (MPP). D/L-glufosinate-ammonium had an elimination half-life of less than 2.3 days during the elimination phase. The bioaccumulation and elimination behavior of glufosinate-ammonium in zebrafish aquatic system was shown in this work, which offered scientific data for assessing the food safety of rac-glufosinate-ammonium and glufosinate-P (pure L-glufosinate-ammonium) in fish.

TI  - Assessing the toxicity of three "inert" herbicide safeners toward Danio rerio: Effects on embryos development.
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Recent studies indicated that 'inert ingredients' exert negative effects on the environment. Herbicide safeners are classed as 'inert ingredients', which increase the selectivity and detoxification of herbicides. However, little attention has been focused on the environmental behavior of herbicide safeners. AD-67 (AD), fenclorim (FM), and flurazole (FZ) are three commercially available herbicide safeners. In this study, zebrafish embryos were used as a model to investigate the potential developmental toxicity of these three safeners. The results showed that AD, FM, and FZ 96 h-LC(50) values were 2.52, 1.26, and 2.01 mg/L, respectively. Significant decreased body lengths were observed in embryos after 96 h of exposure to 0.2 mg/L FM and FZ. Hatching rates significantly increased at 24 h and decreased at 96 h in all treatment groups (0.02 mg/L AD, 0.2 mg/L AD, 0.02 mg/L AD, 0.2 mg/L FZ, as well as 0.01 and 0.1 mg/L FM). No significant (p \textgreater 0.05) changes in heartbeat numbers (60 s), but clearly increased malformation rates were observed in response to safeners exposure. Furthermore, embryos showed signs of oxidative stress, such as decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, altered activities of glutathione reductase and catalase and cell apoptosis. The gene transcription related to body malformation (egf, krt 17, and tbx 16) and cell apoptosis (bcl 2 and bax) changed in treated groups. These genes have been connected to potential toxicological mechanisms. These results indicate that the herbicide safeners AD, FM, and FZ induced developmental toxicities in zebrafish embryos. This study is the first report of the toxicity of safeners in the development of zebrafish embryos. The results may be useful for assessing the risk of herbicides safeners in the aquatic ecosystem.

TI  - The citrus flavonoids hesperidin and naringin alleviate alcohol-induced behavioural alterations and developmental defects in zebrafish larvae
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of two citrus flavonoids, hesperidin and naringin, on alcohol-induced thigmotaxis behavioural and developmental defects in zebrafish. The results of behavioural assays indicated that acute exposure to 1% alcohol could induce thigmotaxis behaviour in zebrafish larvae at 3 and 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), whereas hesperidin and naringin could inhibit the thigmotaxis behaviour in zebrafish larvae. Moreover, developmental administration of hesperidin and naringin reduced the levels of morphological defects and apoptosis induced by developmental alcohol exposure. In conclusion, this study suggests that the citrus flavonoids hesperidin and naringin could reduce the effects of alcohol damage on embryonic development and neurobehaviour in zebrafish larvae, which would provide useful knowledge for assessing the underlying mechanism of citrus flavonoids and their protective effects.

TI  - Effect of thiacloprid on early life stages of common carp (Cyprinus carpio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Toxicity of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiacloprid to embryos and larvae of common carp Cyprinus carpio was assessed under laboratory conditions. Carp embryos and larvae were exposed to thiacloprid at four concentrations: 4.5 (environmental concentration), 45, 225, and 450 mu g/L for 35 days and compared to a non-treated control group. The effects on lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme levels (superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and reduced glutathione), mortality, growth, development, and histopathogenesis were assessed. Thiacloprid at tested concentrations were not associated with negative effects on hatching, behaviour, embryo viability, or Fulton's condition factor. Carp exposed to 45 mu g/L. thiacloprid showed lower weight and length compared to controls. Thiacloprid at 225 and 450 mu g/L delayed development and led to lower weight and length of carp. Significantly lower superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activity was observed at all tested concentrations of thiacloprid compared with the control group. Chronic thiacloprid exposure of early-life stages of carp affected ontogeny and growth rate, and inhibited antioxidant capacity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Imidacloprid and thiamethoxam affect synaptic transmission in zebrafish
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) and thiamethoxam (THM) are two commonly applied neonicotinoid insecticides. IMI and THM could cause negative impacts on non-target organisms like bees. However, the information about neurotoxicity of IMI and THM in fish is still scarce. Here we investigated the effects of IMI and THM on locomotor behavior, AChE activity, and transcription of genes related to synaptic transmission in zebrafish exposed to IMI and THM with concentrations of 50 ng L-1 to 50,000 ng L-1 at 14 day post fertilization (dpf), 21 dpf, 28 dpf and 35 dpf. Our results showed that IMI and THM significantly influenced the locomotor activity in larvae at 28 dpf and 35 dpf. THM elevated AChE activity at 28 dpf. The qPCR data revealed that IMI and THM affected the transcription of marker genes belonging to the synapse from 14 dpf to 35 dpf. Furthermore, IMI and THM mainly affected transcription of key genes in gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine and serotonin pathways in larvae at 28 dpf and 35 dpf. These results demonstrated the neurotoxicity of IMI and THM in zebrafish. The findings from this study suggested that IMI and THM in the aquatic environment may pose potential risks to fish fitness and survival.

TI  - Transcriptional impact of organophosphate and metal mixtures on olfaction: Copper dominates the chlorpyrifos-induced response in adult zebrafish
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Chemical exposures in fish have been linked to loss of olfaction leading to an inability to detect predators and prey and decreased survival. However, the mechanisms underlying olfactory neurotoxicity are not well characterized, especially in environmental exposures which involve chemical mixtures. We used zebrafish to characterize olfactory transcriptional responses by two model olfactory inhibitors, the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mixtures of CPF with the neurotoxic metal copper (Cu). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from olfactory tissues of zebrafish exposed to CPF alone or to a mixture of CPF and Cu. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, whereas gene set analysis was used to identify biological themes in the microarray data. Microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR on genes serving as potential biomarkers of olfactory injury. In addition, we mined our previously published Cu-induced zebrafish olfactory transcriptional response database (Tilton et al., 2008) for the purposes of discriminating pathways of olfaction impacted by either the individual agents or the CPF-Cu mixture transcriptional signatures. CPF exposure altered the expression of gene pathways associated with cellular morphogenesis and odorant binding, but not olfactory signal transduction, a known olfactory pathway for Cu. The mixture profiles shared genes from the Cu and CPF datasets, whereas some genes were altered only by the mixtures. The transcriptional signature of the mixtures was more similar to that in zebrafish exposed to Cu alone than for CPF. In conclusion, exposure to a mixture containing a common environmental metal and pesticide causes a unique transcriptional signature that is heavily influenced by the metal, even when organophosphate predominates.

TI  - Characterization of Developmental Neurobehavioral Toxicity in a Zebrafish MPTP-Induced Model: A Novel Mechanism Involving Anemia
T2  - ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Zebrafish represent an economical alternative to rodents for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing. Mechanistic understanding is the key to successfully translating zebrafish findings to humans. In the present study, we used a well-known dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy-dropyridine (MPTP) as a model chemical to uncover the molecular pathways for observed DNT effects. To enhance the specificity of potential molecular targets, we restricted our exposure to a concentration that is nonteratogenic yet exhibits high DNT effects and an exposure window sensitive to MPTP. Our DNT assessment based on a battery of motor and social behavioral tests revealed an effective concentration of 1 mu M and a sensitive window of 48-96 h postfertilization (hpf) for MPTP-induced hypoactivity. It is worth noting that this hypoactivity persisted into later larval development until 28 dpf. We observed increased cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and decreased ATP levels in larvae immediately after exposure at 96 hpf. Significant reductions of DA neurons were found in the retina at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. No visible deformity was found in motoneurons at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. Transcriptome analysis uncovered a novel pathway manifested by significant upregulation of genes enriched with erythropoiesis. Sensitive window exposure of MPTP and other DA neurotoxins rotenone and paraquat exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on transcriptional changes of embryonic hemoglobins and anemia. Given that anemia is a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease and MPTP is known to cause parkinsonism in humans, we concluded that anemia resulting from dysregulation of primitive erythropoiesis during embryonic development might serve as a common mechanism underlying DA neurotoxin-induced DNT effects between zebrafish and humans.

TI  - Comparative behavioral toxicology with two common larval fish models: Exploring relationships among modes of action and locomotor responses
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Behavioral responses inform toxicology studies by rapidly and sensitively detecting molecular initiation events that propagate to physiological changes in individuals. These behavioral responses can be unique to chemical specific mechanisms and modes of action (MOA) and thus present diagnostic utility. In an initial effort to explore the use of larval fish behavioral response patterns in screening environmental contaminants for toxicity and to identify behavioral responses associated with common chemical specific MOAs, we employed the two most common fish models, the zebrafish and the fathead minnow, to define toxicant induced swimming activity alterations during interchanging photoperiods. Though the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is a common model for aquatic toxicology research and regulatory toxicology practice, this model has received little attention in behavioral studies compared to the zebrafish, a common biomedical model. We specifically compared behavioral responses among 7 different chemicals (1-heptanol, phenol, R-(-)-carvone, citalopram, diazinon, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), and xylazine) that were selected and classified based on anticipated MOA (nonpolar narcosis, polar narcosis, electrophile, specific mechanism) according to traditional approaches to examine whether these comparative responses differ among chemicals with various structure-based predicted toxicity. Following standardized experimental guidelines, zebrafish embryos and fathead minnow larvae were exposed for 96 h to each compound then were observed using digital behavioral analysis. Behavioral observations included photomotor responses, distance traveled, and stimulatory, refractory and cruising locomotor activity. Though fathead minnow larvae displayed greater behavioral sensitivity to 1-heptanol, phenol and citalopram, zebrafish were more sensitive to diazinon and R-(-)-carvone. Both fish models were equally sensitive to xylazine and PTZ. Further, the pharmaceuticals citalopram and xylazine significantly affected behavior at therapeutic hazard values, and each of the seven chemicals elicited unique behavioral response profiles. Larval fish behaviors appear useful as early tier diagnostics to identify mechanisms and pathways associated with diverse biological activities for chemicals lacking mechanistic data.

TI  - Extractive separation of Profenofos as an organophosphorous insecticide from wastewater and plant samples using molecular imprinted cellulose
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - A new selective molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) for solid phase extraction of profenofos (PFF) from aqueous solutions was synthesized by acrylonitrile grafted cotton fibers with hydrazine hydrate in presence of PFF as a template and glutraldhyde as a cross linker. The properties and structure of MIP was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis (EA). Furthermore, the extracted PFF was detected by gas chromatography (GC). Various parameters such as (pH, contact time, temperature, initial concentration of PFF and also washing eluent composition) affecting the extraction efficiency was evaluated to investigate the selectivity and preconcentration from different matrices. Kinetic studies revealed that pseudo second order kinetic equation is the best model describes the adsorption behavior of PFF on MIP. Moreover, the obtained thermodynamic parameters (Delta G(0) < 0, Delta H-0 > 0, Delta S-0 > 0) indicated a spontaneous and endothermic reaction. Furthermore, the maximum sorption capacity was 17.24 mg g(-1). Under the experimental work conditions, limit of detection and limit of quantification were found to be 0.294 mg L-1 and 0.98 mg L-1, respectively. Finally, the proposed imprinted polymer was successfully applied for the extraction of PFF from wastewater and commercial plant samples. The recoveries of PFF were in the range between 94 and 104% with relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 5.0%.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of the mitochondrial and developmental toxicity of three strobilurins in zebrafish embryo/larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Strobilurin fungicides have been frequently detected in aquatic environments and can induce mitochondrial toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms. However, the derived toxicity and subsequent mechanisms related to their adverse effects are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we compared the mitochondrial and developmental toxicity of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin using zebrafish embryo/larvae. The results showed that all three strobilurins inhibited mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration (the potency is pyraclostrobin approximate to trifloxystrobin > azoxystrobin). Behavioral changes indicated that sublethal doses of pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin caused hyperactivity of zebrafish larvae in dark cycles, whereas trifloxystrobin resulted in hypoactivity of zebrafish larvae. In addition, pyraclostrobin exposure impaired the inflation of swim bladder, and caused down-regulation of annexin A5 (anxa5) mRNA levels, and up-regulated transcript levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a (pbx1a); conversely, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin did not cause detectable effects with swim bladder inflation. Molecular docking results indicated that azoxystrobin had higher interacting potency with iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD), prolactin receptor (PRLR), antagonistic conformation of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) compared to pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin; pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin were more likely to interact with the antagonistic conformation of TR beta and GR, respectively. These results may partially explain the different effects observed in behavior and swim bladder inflation, and also point to potential endocrine disruption induced by these strobilurins. Taken together, our study revealed that all three strobilurins alter mitochondrial bioenergetics and cause developmental toxicity. However, the toxic phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of each chemical may differ, and this requires further investigation. Pyraclostrobin showed higher mitochondrial toxicity at lethal doses and higher developmental toxicity at sublethal doses compared to the two other strobilurins tested. These results provide novel information for toxicological study as well as risk assessment of strobilurin fungicides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sources, behaviors, transformations, and environmental risks of organophosphate esters in the coastal environment: A review
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB  - The rapid growth in the global production of organophosphate esters (OPEs) has resulted in their high environmental concentrations. The low removal rate of OPEs makes the effluents of wastewater treatment plants be one of the major sources of OPEs. Due to relatively high solubility and mobility, OPEs can be carried to the coastal environment through river discharge and atmospheric deposition. Therefore, the coastal environment can be an important OPE sink. Previous studies have shown that OPEs were widely detected in coastal atmospheres, water, sediments, and even aquatic organisms. OPEs can undergo various environmental processes in the coastal environment, including adsorption/desorption, air-water exchange, and degradation. In addition, bioaccumulation of OPEs was observed in coastal biota but current concentrations would not cause significant ecological risks. More efforts are required to understand the environmental behaviors of OPEs and address resultant environmental and health risks, especially in the complicated environment.

TI  - The agrochemical S-metolachlor disrupts molecular mediators and morphology of the swim bladder: Implications for locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Metolachlor herbicides are derived from the chloroacetamide chemical family of which there are the Sand Rmetolachlor isomers. S-metolachlor is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 mu M) over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 mu M and above. Exposure levels as high as 200 mu M for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim bladder inflation at 50 mu M in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish exposed to 50 mu M while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance, corresponding to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response test revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 mu M) resulted in hypo activity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship between surface area of the swim bladder and distance traveled, and the size of the swim bladder explained similar to 10-14% in the variation for total distance moved. Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test, and we did not detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration tested. Here we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure to the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may disrupt transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and morphology, which could ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity. These data are expected to contribute to further risk assessment guidelines for S-metolachlor in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - In vivo metabolism of organophosphate flame retardants and distribution of their main metabolites in adult zebrafish
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Understanding the metabolism of chemicals as well as the distribution and depuration of their main metabolites in tissues are essential for evaluating their fate and potential toxicity in vivo. Herein, we investigated the metabolism of six typical organophosphate (OP) flame retardants (tripropyl phosphate (TPRP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tri-p-cresyl phosphate (p-TCP)) in adult zebrafish in laboratory at three levels (0, 1/150 LC50 (environmentally relevant level), and 1/30 LC50 per OP analog). Twenty main metabolites were detected in the liver of OPs-exposed zebrafish using high resolution mass spectrometry (Q-TOF). The reaction pathways involving scission of the ester bond (hydrolysis), cleavage of the ether bond, oxidative hydroxylation, dechlorination, and coupling with glucuronic acid were proposed, and were further confirmed by the frontier electron density and point charge calculations. Tissue distribution of the twenty metabolites revealed that liver and intestine with the highest levels of metabolites were the most active organs for OPs biotransformation among the studied tissues of intestine, liver, roe, brain, muscle, and gill, which showed the importance of hepatobiliary system (liver-bile-intestine) in the metabolism and excretion of OPs in zebrafish. Fast depuration of metabolites from tissues indicated that the formed metabolites might be not persistent in fish, and easily released into water. This study provides comprehensive information on the metabolism of OPs in the tissue of zebrafish, which might give some hints for the exploration of their toxic mechanism in aquatic life.

TI  - Developmental atrazine exposure in zebrafish produces the same major metabolites as mammals along with altered behavioral outcomes
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most commonly applied agricultural herbicide in the United States. Due to contamination concerns, the U.S. EPA has set the maximum contaminant level in potable water sources at 3 parts per billion (ppb; mu g/l). Depending on the time of year and sampling location, water sources often exceed this limit. ATZ is an endocrine disrupting chemical in multiple species observed to target the neuroendocrine system. In this study the zebrafish vertebrate model was used to test the hypothesis that a developmental ATZ exposure generates metabolites similar to those found in mammals and alters morphology and behavior in developing larvae. Adult AB zebrafish were bred, embryos were collected, and exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb ATZ from 1 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Targeted metabolomic analysis found that zebrafish produce the same major ATZ metabolites as mammals: desethyl atrazine (DEA), deisopropyl atrazine (DIA), and diaminochloroatrazine (DACT). The visual motor response test at 120 hpf detected hyperactivity in larvae in the 0.3 ppb treatment group and hypoactivity in the 30 ppb treatment group (p < 0.05). Further analysis into behavior during the dark and light phases showed zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had an increase in total distance moved in the first light phase and time spent moving in the first dark and light phases (p < 0.05). Alternatively, a decrease in total distance moved was observed in the second and third dark phases in zebrafish exposed to 30 ppb ATZ (p 0.05). No significant differences were observed for any of the morphological measurements following ATZ exposure from 1 to 120 hpf (p 0.05). These findings suggest that a ATZ exposure during early development generates metabolite profiles similar to mammals and leads to behavioral alterations supporting ATZ as a neurodevelopmental toxicant.

TI  - Analysis of transcriptional response in zebrafish eleutheroembryos exposed to climbazole: Signaling pathways and potential biomarkers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Climbazole is an antifungal active ingredient used in personal care products. After application this chemical reaches the aquatic environment and may pose a risk to fish. In the present study, we measured the transcriptional effects of essential genes related to a wide range of signaling pathways on zebrafish eleutheroembryos exposed to climbazole at environmentally relevant and predicted worst-case environmental concentrations, and explored the potential biomarkers via partial least squares discriminant analysis. Transcription analysis covering up to 73 genes revealed significant down-regulation of circadian rhythm- and steroidogenesis-related genes in zebrafish embryos and larvae after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of climbazole. This topical antifungal agent also modulated the transcripts of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, oocyte maturation, and sexual differentiation at predicted worst-case environmental concentrations. In addition, mpr alpha, igf3, nr1d1, nr1d2b, cyp19a1a, vtg1, il-1 beta, and il-8 were chosen as potential biomarkers in embryonic zebrafish following exposure to climbazole. These findings can help us understand the remarkable transcriptional response to climbazole in the early life stage of zebrafish. Future research should elucidate whether the transcriptional modulation translates into metabolic phenotypes associated with the corresponding signaling pathways.

TI  - Getting more out of the zebrafish light dark transition test
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - In (eco-)toxicological studies the light/dark transition (LDT) test is one of the most frequently used behaviour assays with zebrafish eleutheroembryos. However, study results vary regarding data presentation and analysis and mostly focus on a limited amount of the recorded data. In this study, we investigated whether monitoring two behavioural outcomes (time and distance moved) together with analysing multiple parameters can improve test sensitivity and data interpretation. As a proof of principle 5-day old zebrafish (Danio rerio) eleutheroembryos exposed to either endocrine disruptors (EDs) or acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors were investigated. We analysed conventional parameters such as mean and sum and implemented additional endpoints such as minimum or maximum distance moved and new parameters assessing the bursting response of eleutheroembryos. Furthermore, changes in eleutheroembryonic behaviour during the moment of the light to dark transition were added. To improve data presentation control-normalised results were displayed in radar charts, enabling the simultaneous presentation of different parameters in relation to each other. This enabled us to identify parameters most relevant to a certain behavioural response. A cut off threshold using control data was applied to identify parameters that were altered in a biological relevant manner. Our approach was able to detect effects on different parameters that remained undetected when analysis was done using conventional bar graphs on - in most cases analysed - averaged, mean distance moved values. By combining the radar charts with additional parameters and by using control-based thresholds, we were able to increase the test sensitivity and promote a deeper understanding of the behaviour response of zebrafish eleutheroembryos in the LDT test and thereby increased its usability for behavioural toxicity studies.

TI  - Transgenerational effects of developmental exposure to chlorpyrifos-oxon in zebrafish (DANIO RERIO)
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The organophosphate chlorpyrifos, and its active metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), have been attributed to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is unclear if the adverse effects associated with developmental exposure to the active CPO persist into adulthood and future generations. The goal of this study was to investigate whether CPO-associated changes in embryo-larval zebrafish (ZF) behavior at the F0 5 dpf were manifest throughout the life of the exposed F0, and are inherited by subsequent generations. For this study, embryos were exposed to chlorpyrifos-oxon at the environmentally relevant concentration of 0.01 mu g/L and a high concentration of 50 mu g/L starting at 4 hpf to 5 dpf, and then raised to F2. There was a significant decrease in distance traveled with 5 dpf F0 ZF exposed to the 50 mu g/L CPO, with alterations in noncholinergic genes CFOS and LINGO, and alterations in global DNA methylation. CPO-related behavioral effects were ameliorated by day 21 through the F1 generation. This trend changed with hyperactive behavior, increase acetylcholine concentration in F2 zebrafish that were exposed to 50 mu g/L CPO during the F0 development. There was also an increase in AChE activity and hypermethylation in F2 0.01 mu g/L exposure larvae, indicating that even low dose exposures can have transgenerational effects. Results from this study demonstrate that early life stage exposures to CPO can lead to epigenetic changes in neurological activity, which may lead to alterations in response to CPO in future generations. Abstract summary: This study identified a correlation between CPO exposure during F0 development and significant differences in F2 behavioral, AChE activity and neurotransmitter concentration.

TI  - Teratogenic, Oxidative Stress and Behavioural Outcomes of Three Fungicides of Natural Origin (Equisetum arvense, Mimosa tenuiflora, Thymol) on Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - The improper use of synthetic fungicides has raised public concerns related to environmental pollution and animal health. Over the years, plant-derived antifungals have been investigated as safer alternatives, although little scientific evidence of its neurodevelopmental effects exist. The main objective of this study was to explore the effects of three alternative natural extracts (Equisetum arvense, Mimosa tenuiflora, Thymol) with antifungal properties during the early development of zebrafish by evaluating different teratogenic, oxidative stress and behavioural outcomes. Following the determination of the 96 h-LC50, exposure to sublethal concentrations showed the safety profile of both E. arvense and M. tenuiflora. However, following 96-h exposure to Thymol, increased lethality, pericardial oedema, yolk and eye deformations, and decreased body length were observed. The reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratio was increased, and the glutathione-s-transferase activity in the group exposed to the highest Thymol concentration. Overall, these results support a more reducing environment associated with possible effects at the cellular proliferation level. In addition, the disruption of behavioural states (fear- and anxiety-like disorders) were noted, pointing to alterations in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase developmental signalling pathway, although further studies are required to explore this rationale. Notwithstanding, the results provide direct evidence of the teratogenic effects of Thymol, which might have consequences for non-target species.

TI  - Stereoselective uptake and metabolism of prothioconazole caused oxidative stress in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Prothioconazole (PTA) is a novel, broad-spectrum, chiral triazole fungicide that is mainly used to prevent and control the disease of cereal crops. However, the adverse effects of PTA and its major metabolite on nontarget organisms have aroused wide concern. In the present work, the acute toxic of the metabolite prothioconazole-desthio (PTA-desthio), with an LC50 of 1.31 mg L-1, was 3.5-fold more toxic than the parent compound, indicating that the metabolism of PTA in zebrafish was toxic. The stereoselective uptake and metabolism of PTA and PTA-desthio in zebrafish was firstly investigated using LC-MS/MS. Remarkable enantioselectivity was observed: S-PTA and S-PTA-desthio were preferentially uptake with the uptake rate constants of 8.22 and 8.15 d(-1) at exposure concentration of 0.5 mg L-1, respectively, and the R-PTA-desthio were preferentially metabolized. PTA-desthio was rapidly formed during the uptake processes. The antioxidant enzyme activities in the zebrafish changed significantly, and these effects were reversible. A metabolic pathway including 13 phase I metabolites and 2 phase II metabolites was firstly proposed. A glucuronic acid conjugate and sulfate conjugate were observed in zebrafish. The results of this work provide information that highlights and can help mitigate the potential toxicity of PTA to the ecological environment and humans health.

TI  - Differential responses of larval zebrafish to the fungicide propamocarb: Endpoints at development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The fungicide propamocarb (PM) is widely used to protect cucumbers, tomatoes and other plants from pathogens. According to previous studies, PM could be detected in the aquatic system in some area. However, the toxic effects of PM on zebrafish received very limited attention. In this study, we examined the toxic effects of various concentration of PM on the endpoints of development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. It was observed that PM exposure delayed embryonic development, inhibited hatchability at 60 and 72 h postfertilization and increased heart rate. After PM exposure, the larval zebrafish showed abnormal free swimming behavior and the swimming behavior in response to light-dark transition, indicating that PM had the potential to induce neurotoxicity. Moreover, PM exposure also affected the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase and dopamine and the transcriptional level of genes related to neurotoxicity. In addition, PM exposure not only affects catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity but also affects the transcription level of various genes. We believed that PM induced oxidative stress was also a possible reason to cause neurotoxicity in larval zebrafish. In summary, our results suggested that PM could disturb the endpoints at development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of penthiopyrad on the development and behaviour of zebrafish in early-life stages
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The agricultural use of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides has increased dramatically in the US and Europe. As the SDHI fungicides, boscalid, flutolanil and thifluzamide had been reported to induce a series of toxic effects on zebrafish. However, the toxic effects of penthiopyrad on zebrafish have not been reported yet. This study aimed to assess the acute toxicity of penthiopyrad to zebrafish in early life stages and investigate behavioural response of larvae and the effects on lipid metabolism and pigmentation under sub-lethal exposure of penthiopyrad. Based on results of the acute toxicity tests of zebrafish embryo and larvae, penthiopyrad had an acute toxicity to early-life stages of zebrafish and induced a series of deformities during development. Based on the results of sub-lethal exposure for 8 days, penthiopyrad resulted in significant decreases in swimming velocity, acceleration speed, distance moved and inactive time of larvae at 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/L. Penthiopyrad induced the disorders of lipid metabolism via affecting fatty acid synthesis and beta-oxidation, in accordance with remarkable changes in the content of triglycerides and cholesterol and the expression of key genes (hmgcr alpha, ppar alpha 1, srebf1, cyp51 and acca1) at 1.2 mg/L. In addition, the disorder of melanin synthesis and distribution was caused by penthiopyrad in larvae in accordance with changes in body colour and related gene expression at 8 dpe.

TI  - Some environmental contaminants influence motor and feeding behaviors in the ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo) via distinct cerebral histamine receptor subtypes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Common environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides pose serious risks to behavioral and neuroendocrine functions of many aquatic organisms. In the present study, we show that the heavy metal cadmium and the pesticide endosulfan produce such effects through an interaction of specific cerebral histamine receptor subtypes in the teleost ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo). Treatment of this teleost with toxic cadmium levels for 1 week was sufficient to induce abnormal swimming movements, whereas reduced feeding behaviors were provoked predominantly by elevated endosulfan concentrations. In the brain, these environmental contaminants caused neuronal degeneration in cerebral targets such as the mesencephalon and hypothalamus, damage that appeared to correlate with altered binding levels of the three major histamine receptors (subtypes 1, 2, and 3). Although cadmium accounted for reduced binding activity of all three subtypes in most brain regions, it was subtype 2 that seemed to be its main target, as shown by a very great (p < 0.001) down-regulation in mesencephalic areas such as the stratum griseum central layer. Conversely, endosulfan provided very great and great (p < 0.01) up-regulating effects of subtype 3 and I levels, respectively, in preoptic-hypothalamic areas such as the medial part of the lateral tuberal nucleus, and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results suggest that the neurotoxicant-dependent abnormal motor and feeding behaviors may well be tightly linked to binding activities of distinct histamine subtypes in localized brain regions of the Thalassoma pavo.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of antimony (Sb) in the early life stages of zebrafish
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Accumulating studies have revealed the toxicity of antimony (Sb) to soil-dwelling and aquatic organisms at the individual level. However, little is known about the neumtoxic effects of antimony and its underlying mechanisms. To assess this issue, we investigated the neurotoxicity of antimony (0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg/L) in zebrafish embryos. After exposure, zebrafish embryos showed abnormal phenotypes such as a shortened body length, morphological malformations, and weakened heart function. Behavioral experiments indicated that antimony caused neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, manifested in a decreased spontaneous movement frequency, delayed response to touch, and reduced movement distance. We also showed that antimony caused a decrease in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in zebrafish embryos, along with decreased expression of neurofunctional markers such as gfap, nestin, mbp, and shha. Additionally, antimony significantly increased reactive oxygen species levels and significantly reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In summary, our findings indicated that antimony can induce developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos by affecting neurotransmitter systems and oxidative stress, thus altering behavior. These outcomes will advance our understanding of antimony-induced neumtoxicity, environmental problems, and health hazards.

TI  - Linking behavioural alterations with biomarkers responses in the European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax L. exposed to the organophosphate pesticide fenitrothion
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The acute effects of the organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion on Dicentrarchus labrax juveniles were investigated through a bioassay using biomarkers and swimming behaviour as effect criteria. After 96 h of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion, the swimming velocity and several biomarkers were individually determined, namely: brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; muscle cholinesterases (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities; liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). A significant decrease of the swimming velocity (LOEC = 2 mg l(-1)), an inhibition of both AChE (LOEC = 0.06 mg l(-1)) and ChE activities (LOEC = 0.03 mg l(-1)), and a positive and significant correlation between the swimming velocity and AChE were found in exposed fish, suggesting an influence of the inhibition of these enzymes in the swimming velocity decrease. An increase of EROD activity (LOEC = 1 mg l(-1)), indicating the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD (LOEC = 0.13 mg l(-1)) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme is preventing oxidative stress damage. No significant alterations were found in any of the other parameters tested. Thus, exposure of seabass to fenitrothion in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested here may have adverse consequences at population level as neurotransmission and swimming ability are essential for fish performance and survival.

TI  - Developmental origins of neurotransmitter and transcriptome alterations in adult female zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis
T2  - TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Atrazine is an herbicide applied to agricultural crops and is indicated to be an endocrine disruptor. Atrazine is frequently found to contaminate potable water supplies above the maximum contaminant level of 3 mu g/L as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The developmental origin of adult disease hypothesis suggests that toxicant exposure during development can increase the risk of certain diseases during adulthood. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression are still unknown. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 mu g/L atrazine throughout embryogenesis. Larvae were then allowed to mature under normal laboratory conditions with no further chemical treatment until 7 days post fertilization (dpf) or adulthood and neurotransmitter analysis completed. No significant alterations in neurotransmitter levels was observed at 7 dpf or in adult males, but a significant decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and serotonin turnover was seen in adult female brain tissue. Transcriptomic analysis was completed on adult female brain tissue to identify molecular pathways underlying the observed neurological alterations. Altered expression of 1928, 89, and 435 genes in the females exposed to 0.3, 3, or 30 mu g/L atrazine during embryogenesis were identified, respectively. There was a high level of overlap between the biological processes and molecular pathways in which the altered genes were associated. Moreover, a subset of genes was down regulated throughout the serotonergic pathway. These results provide support of the developmental origins of neurological alterations observed in adult female zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Assessing the toxicity of the benzamide fungicide zoxamide in zebrafish (Danio rerio): Towards an adverse outcome pathway for beta-tubulin inhibitors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Commercial benzamide fungicides are applied to crops to control damage caused by oomycete fungi and are used as veterinary pharmaceuticals in aquaculture. The mechanism of action of these fungicides is to induce mitotic arrest via binding to beta-tubulin, thus inhibiting tubulin polymerization. However, there are little toxicity data available for benzimidazole fungicides in fish. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted zebrafish embryo toxicity tests to assess deformities, survival, and sub-lethal responses following exposure to zoxamide (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mu M zoxamide). We hypothesized that skeletal deformities would be prevalent in zebrafish due to its mechanism of inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization. Zoxamide was relatively toxic to zebrafish embryos and larvae, and survival was reduced similar to 50 % at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) with 10 mu M exposure and over time at 6 dpf, 2.5 mu M exposure reduced survival by similar to 20 %. Frequency of hatch was also reduced/delayed in zebrafish at 3 dpf with > 2.5 mu M zoxamide. Pericardial edema, body length shortening, and spine curvature were observed in larvae exposed to > 5 mu M. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were assessed in similar to 30 hpf embryos (24-hour exposure) using an XFe24 Flux Analyzer and regression analysis revealed a negative relationship between basal respiration and zoxamide concentration. Superoxide dismutase 1 and caspase 3 mRNA levels were both decreased in 6 dpf larvae exposed to 2.5 mu M zoxamide, but were not changed in expression at 0.5 nor 1 mu M zoxamide. Continuous 6-day exposure to zoxamide reduced larval activity at 2.5 mu M; conversely a 24-hour exposure (at 5-6 dpf) induced hyperactivity at 5 mu M suggesting dose and time dependent effects on fish behavior. Based on sub-lethal endpoints, we conceptualize an adverse outcome pathway for chemicals that inhibit tubulin polymerization.

TI  - Perturbation of metabonome of embryo/larvae zebrafish after exposure to fipronil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The escalating demand for fipronil by the increasing insects' resistance to synthetic pyrethroids placed a burden on aquatic vertebrates. Although awareness regarding the toxicity of fipronil to fish is arising, the integral alteration caused by fipronil remains unexplored. Here, we investigated on the development toxicity of fipronil and the metabolic physiology perturbation at 120 h post fertilization through GC-MS metabolomics on zebrafish embryo. We observed that fipronil dose-dependently induced malformations including uninflated swim bladder and bent spine. Further, the “omic” technique hit 26 differential metabolites after exposure to fipronil and five significant signaling pathways. We speculated that changes in primary bile acid synthesis pathway and the content of saturated fatty acid in the chemical-related group indicated the liver toxicity. Pathway of Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis changed by fipronil may relate to the macromolecular synthesis. Concurrently, methane metabolism pathway was also identified while the role in zebrafish needs further determination. Overall, this study revealed several new signaling pathways in fipronil-treated zebrafish embryo/larval. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does time difference of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition in different tissues exist? A case study of zebra fish (Danio rerio) exposed to cadmium chloride and deltamethrin
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - In order to illustrate time difference in toxic effects of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and deltamethrin (DM), AChE activities were measured in different tissues, liver, muscle, brain, and gill, of Zebra fish (Danio rerio) across different concentrations in this research. The average AChE activity decreased comparing to 0.0 TU with DM (82.81% in 0.1 TU, 56.14% in 1.0 TU and 44.68% in 2.0 TU) and with CdCl2 (74.68% in 0.1 TU, 52.05% in 1.0 TU and 50.14% in 2.0 TU) showed an overall decrease with the increase of exposure concentrations. According to Self-Organizing Map (SOM), the AChE activities were characterized in relation with experimental conditions, showing an inverse relationship with exposure time. As the exposure time was longer, the AChE activities were correspondingly lower. The AChE inhibition showed time delay in sublethal treatments (0.1 TU) in different tissues: the AChE was first inhibited in brain by chemicals followed by gill, muscle and liver (brain > gill > muscle > liver). The AChE activity was almost inhibited synchronously in higher environmental stress (1.0 TU and 2.0 TU). As the AChE inhibition can induce abnormal of behavior movement, these results will be helpful to the mechanism of stepwise behavior responses according to the time difference in different tissues rather than the whole body AChE activity.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of maneb: Notochord defects, mitochondrial dysfunction and hypoactivity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Broad applications and exposure to the fungicide maneb can lead to toxicity in non-target organisms. Maneb is also associated with neurogenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The objectives of this study were to determine the acute toxicity of maneb to zebrafish by measuring mitochondrial bioenergetics, locomotor activity, and the expression of genes related to the oxidative damage response, as well as those related to dopamine signaling due to its association with PD. Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either solvent control (0.1% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 mu M maneb for 96 h. Maneb was moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos, and had a 96-h LC(50 )value of 4.29 mu M (similar to 1.14 mg/L). Maneb induced a dose-dependent increase in mortality, decreased hatching rate, and increased notochord deformity rate at both 1.0 and 10.0 mu M after 72 and 96 h. Total body length was also significantly reduced with 1.0 mu M maneb. A 50-60% decrease in mean basal oxygen consumption rate was also observed in embryos following a 24 hpf exposure to 10.0 mu M maneb but oligomycin-induced ATP production and FCCP-induced maximum respiration remained unaffected. No change was detected in the expression levels of genes associated with oxidative stress (sodl and sod2), nor those related to dopamine synthesis (th1), dopamine transporter (dat), dopamine receptors (drd1, drd2a, drd3, and drd4b). Thus, modifying the expression of these transcripts may not be a mechanism for maneb-induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish. To assess the potential for neurotoxicity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae following 7 d exposure to 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mu M maneb. Larvae exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 mu M maneb showed signs related to hypoactivity, and this reduced activity is hypothesized to be associated with notochord defects as this deformity was prevalent at higher concentrations of maneb. Overall, these data demonstrate that maneb negatively affects embryonic development (i.e. notochord development), affects basal oxygen consumption rates of embryos, and induces hypoactivity in larval fish. This study improves understanding regarding the developmental neurotoxicity of the fungicide maneb to zebrafish.

TI  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate disrupts axonal growth, cholinergic system and motor behavior in early life zebrafish
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) could have neurotoxic effects and alter motor behaviors in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, however, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, zebrafish embryos were subjected to waterborne exposure of TDCIPP at 100, 300, 600, 900 mu g/L from 2 to 120-h post-fertilization (hpf). Behavioral measurements indicate that TDCIPP exposure significantly elevated spontaneous movement, and altered swimming behavior response of larvae to both light and dark stimulation. Interestingly, in accordance with these motor effects, TDCIPP significantly decreased expression of the neuron-specific GFP in transgenic (HuC-GFP) zebrafish larvae as well as decreased expression of the neural marker genes elavl3 and ngnl, inhibited the axonal growth of the secondary motoneurons and altered the expressions of axon-related genes (alpha l-tubtdin, shha and netrin2) in zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, TDCIPP exposure at 900 mu g/L significantly increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, and decreased the total acetylcholine (ACh) concentration. Our data indicate that the alteration in motor neuron and inhibition of cholinergic system could together lead to the TDCIPP induced motor behavior alterations in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Clethodim exposure induces developmental immunotoxicity and neurobehavioral dysfunction in zebrafish embryos
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, but its potential negative effects on aquatic organisms are still poorly understood. This study examined the effects of clethodim on zebrafish at aspects of early stage embryonic development, immune toxicity, cell apoptosis and locomotor behavior. Firstly, clethodim exposure markedly decreased the survival rate, body length, and heart rate and resulted in a series of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and yolk sac edema, in zebrafish larvae. Secondly, the number of immune cells was substantially reduced but the levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon clethodim exposure. Thirdly, we evaluated the expression of some key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappa B p65 and they were all up regulated by exposure to 300 mu g/L clethodim. Meanwhile, some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL8, and IFN-gamma were also activated in both the mock and the TLR4-KD conditions. Moreover, the locomotor behaviors and the enzymatic activities of AChE were obviously inhibited but the levels of acetylated histone H3 were greatly increased by clethodim exposure. In addition, incubation of zebrafish larvae with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol can partially rescue the clethodim-modulated locomotor behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that clethodim has the potential to induce developmental immunotoxicity and cause behavioral alterations in zebrafish larvae. The information presented in this study will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying clethodim exposure in aquatic ecosystems.

T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Dieldrin (DLD) is a lipophilic pesticide that shows environmental persistence. The objectives were to determine the effects of DLD on GABAergic and dopaminergic systems in developing zebrafish. Both chorionated and dechorionated embryos (similar to 24 h post-hatch) were exposed to a single concentration of DLD (0347-3470 mu M) for 48 h. Following exposure, a subset of larvae was placed into clean water for 6 days (i.e. depuration phase). Chorionated embryos showed <15% mortality while dechorionated embryos showed higher mortality (>30%), suggesting that the chorion protected the embryos. Over a 6 day depuration phase, there was a dose dependent effect observed in both the “dechorionated and chorionated embryo” treatments for larval mortality (>60%). At the end of depuration, there was no detectable change in neuro-morphological endpoints that included the ratio of notochord length to body length (%) and the ratio of head area to body area (%). However, DLD did induce cardiac edema, skeletal deformities, and tremors. GABA-related transcripts were not affected in abundance by DLD. Conversely, the relative mRNA levels of dopamine transporter (data) and dopamine receptor drd2a mRNA were decreased in dechorionated, but not chorionated, embryos. These data suggest that DLD can alter the expression of transcripts related to dopaminergic signaling. Lastly, GABA(A) receptor subunits gabrB1 and gabrB2, as well as dopamine receptors drdl and drd2a, were inherently higher in abundance in dechorionated embryos compared to chorionated embryos. This is an important consideration when incorporating transcriptomics into embryo testing as expression levels can change with removal of the chorion prior to exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Comprehensive Enantioselectivity Evaluation of Insecticidal Activity and Mammalian Toxicity of Fenobucarb
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency and risk of the chiral pesticide fenobucarb, the bioactivity, toxicity, andenvironmental behavior of fenobucarb (FNC) enantiomers were investigated. The results showed that R-FNC possesses 1.8-2.7times more bioactivity than S-FNC but 1.3-3.0 times lower toxicity than S-FNC against four nontarget organisms:Chlorellapyrenoidosa, HepG2, andDanio rerioand its embryos. The corresponding enzyme inhibitory activity showed consistent results; theacetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of target organisms was ordered as R-FNC > rac-FNC > S-FNC, while the reduction incatalase activity after exposure to R-FNC was 2.5 times that after exposure to S-FNC in zebrafish. The enantioselective bioactivitymechanism of FNC enantiomers was further exploredin silico. No significant enantioselective degradation was found in soils or ratliver microsomes. In sum, R-FNC possesses higher insecticidal activity and lower toxicity. The development of R-FNC as acommercial agrochemical is beneficial for reducing pesticide inputs

TI  - FISH SHORT-TERM REPRODUCTION ASSAY WITH ATRAZINE AND THE JAPANESE MEDAKA (ORYZIAS LATIPES)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Breeding groups of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to atrazine at measured concentrations of 0.6, 5.5, and 53 mu g/L for 35 d. Evaluated endpoints included survival, fecundity, fertility, growth (weight and length), behavior, secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae), gonad histopathology, and hepatic vitellogenin. No statistically significant effects of atrazine exposure on survival and growth of medaka were noted during the test, and mean survival was >= 97.5% in all treatment groups on day 35. No significant effects of atrazine exposure on reproduction were observed. The number of mean cumulative eggs produced in the negative control and the 0.6, 5.5, and 53 mu g/L treatment groups was 7158, 6691, 6883, and 6856, respectively. The mean number of eggs per female reproductive day was 40.9, 38.2, 40.2, and 39.2, respectively. There were also no dose-dependent effects on mean anal fin papillae counts among male fish or expression of vtg-II in males or females. In addition, atrazine exposure was not related to the developmental stage of test fish, with testes stages ranging from 2 to 3 in all groups and ovaries ranging from stage 2 to 2.5. Overall, exposure to atrazine up to 53 mu g/L for 35 d did not result in significant, treatment-related effects on measured endpoints related to survival, growth, or reproduction in Japanese medaka.

TI  - Anti-Tumor Active Isopropylated Fused Azaisocytosine-Containing Congeners Are Safe for Developing Danio rerio as Well as Red Blood Cells and Activate Apoptotic Caspases in Human Breast Carcinoma Cells
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - New isopropylated fused azaisocytosine-containing congeners (I-VI) have previously been reported as promising anticancer drug candidates, so further research on these molecules in the preclinical development phase is fully justified and necessary. For this reason, in the present paper, we assess the toxicity/safety profiles of all the compounds using Danio rerio and red blood cell models, and examine the effect of the most selective congeners on the activation of apoptotic caspases in cancer and normal cells. In order to evaluate the effect of each molecule on the development of zebrafish embryos/larvae and to select the safest compounds for further study, various phenotypic parameters (i.e., mortality, hatchability, heart rate, heart oedema, yolk sac utilization, swim bladder development and body shape) were observed, and the half maximal lethal concentration, the maximal non-lethal concentration and no observed adverse effect concentration for each compound were established. The effect of all the isopropylated molecules was compared to that of an anticancer agent pemetrexed. The lipophilicity-dependent structure-toxicity correlations were also determined. To establish the possible interaction of the compounds with red blood cells, an ex vivo hemolysis test was performed. It was shown that almost all of the investigated isopropylated congeners have no adverse phenotypic effect on zebrafish development during five-day exposure at concentrations up to 50 mu M (I-III) or up to 20 mu M (IV-V), and that they are less toxic for embryos/larvae than pemetrexed, demonstrating their safety. At the same time, all the molecules did not adversely affect the red blood cells, which confirms their very good hemocompatibility. Moreover, they proved to be activators of apoptotic caspases, as they increased caspase-3, -7 and -9 levels in human breast carcinoma cells. The conducted research allows us to select-from among the anticancer active drug candidates-compounds that are safe for developing zebrafish and red blood cells, suitable for further in vivo pharmacological tests.

TI  - Developmental exposure of zebrafish larvae to organophosphate flame retardants causes neurotoxicity
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - With the gradual ban on brominated flame retardants (FRs), the application of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has increased remarkably. Considering the structural similarity between OPFRs and organophosphate pesticides, hypotheses that OPFRs may interfere with neurodevelopment as organophosphate pesticides are reasonable. In this study, the neurotoxicity of three OPFRs, including tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), was evaluated in zebrafish larvae and then compared with the neurotoxicity of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). The results showed that similar to CPF, exposure to OPFRs for 5 days resulted in significant changes in locomotor behavior, either in free swimming or in photomotor response. However, given the transcriptional changes that occur in nervous system genes in response to OPFRs and CPF, as well as the altered enzyme activity of AChE and its mRNA level, the underlying mechanisms for neurotoxicity among these organophosphate chemicals might be varied. In summary, the results confirm the potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of OPFRs and underscore the importance of identifying the mechanistic targets of the OPFRs with specific moieties. Furthermore, as the neurobehavioral responses are well conserved among vertebrates and the exposure of children to OPFRs is significant, a thorough assessment of the risk of OPFRs exposure during early development should be highly emphasized in future studies.

TI  - Effects of sulfometuron-methyl on zebrafish at early developmental stages
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Sulfometuron methyl (SM) is a widely used herbicide and thus leading to accumulation in the environment. The toxicity assessments of SM in model organisms are currently rare. In the present study, zebrafish were utilized for evaluating the detrimental effects of SM in aquatic vertebrates. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM from 5.5 to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf), respectively. Consequently, SM exposure resulted in increasing the mortality rate and reducing hatching rate in larval zebrafish at 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent manner. The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1I3, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y, IL-10, and TGF-I3) were measured to estimate immune responses. Anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-I3) were downregulated in all the treated groups and significantly altered at 40 mg/L exposure group. Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that SM treatment significantly increased the total distance, average speed, and maximum acceleration of larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and subsequently enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS level in all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were significantly increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration group induced the substantial increment (P < 0.001) of apoptosis-related genes including p53, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3. In summary, our results demonstrated that exposure to SM caused toxicity of development, immune system, locomotor behavior, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis at the early developmental stages of zebrafish.

TI  - Pesticide sensitivity of Nothobranchius neumanni, a temporary pond predator with a non-generic life-history
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Pesticides are crucial to improve agricultural productivity, but often adversely affect surrounding aquatic systems and their fauna. To determine the environmental risk of pesticides, routine ecotoxicological tests are performed on several organisms, including standard fish models. However, these typically do not include fish species from variable habitats and with non-generic life-histories. In particular, inhabitants from temporary ponds such as annual killifish are conventionally understood to be resilient to natural stressors which could translate to higher pesticide resistance or, alternatively, trade-off with their resistance to pesticides and render them more sensitive than classic fish models. Using standard exposure tests, we assessed short-term toxicity effects of two commonly used pesticides, Roundup and cypermethrin, on the annual killifish Nothobranchius neumanni, and compared its sensitivity with that of classic fish models. For Roundup, we found a 72 h-LC50 of 1.79 +/- 0.11 mg/L, which is lower than the values reported for zebrafish, medaka, fathead minnow and rainbow trout, suggesting that N. neumanni is more sensitive to the compound. The opposite was true for cypermethrin, with a 72 h-LC50 of 0.27 +/- 0.03 mg/L. However, these LC50-values do not deviate strongly from those reported for other fish species, supporting earlier findings in the congeneric N. furzeri that the sensitivity of annual killifish to pollutants is similar to that of classic fish models despite their assumed robustness to environmental stress.

TI  - Long-term exposure to polyethylene microplastics and glyphosate interferes with the behavior, intestinal microbial homeostasis, and metabolites of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) and glyphosate (GLY) occur widely and have toxic characteristics, resulting in increased research interest. In this study, common carp were used to assess the individual and combined toxicity of PE-MPs (0, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/L) and GLY (0, 5, or 15 mg/L) on the brain-gut axis. After 60 days of exposure, the developmental toxicity, blood-brain barrier (BBB), locomotor behavior, intestinal barrier (physical barrier, chemical barrier, microbial barrier), and intestinal content metabolism of common carp were evaluated. Results showed that 15 mg/L of GLY exposure significantly reduced the mRNA expression of tight-junction genes (occludin, claudin-2, and ZO-1) in the brain, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was clearly inhibited by high concentrations of GLY. However, different concentrations of PE-MPs had no significant effect on the activity of AChE. Furthermore, the free-swimming behavior of common carp was distinctly inhibited by treatment with a combination of 15 mg/L GLY and 4.5 mg/L PE-MPs. Histological studies indicated that PE-MPs alone and in combination with GLY could disrupt the physical and chemical intestinal barriers of common carp. Additionally, the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota in common carp were significantly changed when exposed to a combination of PE-MPs and GLY. Metabolomics further revealed that PE-MPs combined with GLY triggered metabolic changes and that differential metabolites

TI  - Antioxidative responses in zebrafish liver exposed to sublethal doses Aphanizomenon flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Aphanizomenon flos-aquae secretes paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs), termed aphantoxins, and endangers environmental and human health via eutrophication of water worldwide. Although the molecular mechanism of neuronal PSP toxicity has been well studied, several issues remain unresolved, notably the in vivo hepatic antioxidative responses to this neurotoxin. Aphantoxins extracted from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. The primary components were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 and neosaxitoxin. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated intraperitoneally with either 53 or 7.61 (low and high doses, respectively) mu g saxitoxin (STX) equivalents (eq)/kg of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Antioxidative responses in zebrafish liver were examined at different timepoints 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin administration significantly enhanced hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content 1-12 h post-exposure, indicative of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in zebrafish liver declined significantly after 3-24 h exposure, suggesting that GSH participates in MDA metabolism. A significant upregulation of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed, suggesting that aphantoxins induce lipid peroxidation in zebrafish liver and are likely to be hepatotoxic. Hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, and of the three enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), therefore provide potential biomarkers for studying environmental exposure to aphantoxins/PSPs from cyanobacterial blooms.

TI  - Fish Embryo Toxicity Test: Identification of Compounds with Weak Toxicity and Analysis of Behavioral Effects To Improve Prediction of Acute Toxicity for Neurotoxic Compounds
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The fish embryo toxicity test has been proposed as an alternative for the acute fish toxicity test, but concerns have been raised for its predictivity given that a few compounds have been shown to exhibit a weak acute toxicity in the fish embryo. In order to better define the applicability domain and improve the predictive capacity of the fish embryo test, we performed a systematic analysis of existing fish embryo and acute fish toxicity data. A correlation analysis of a total of 153 compounds identified 28 compounds with a weaker or no toxicity in the fish embryo test. Eleven of these compounds exhibited a neurotoxic mode of action. We selected a subset of eight compounds with weaker or no embryo toxicity (cyanazine, picloram, aldicarb, azinphos-methyl, dieldrin, diquat dibromide, endosulfan, and esfenvalerate) to study toxicokinetics and a neurotoxic mode of action as potential reasons for the deviating fish embryo toxicity. Published fish embryo LC50 values were confirmed by experimental analysis of zebrafish embryo LC50 according to OECD guideline 236. Except for diquat dibromide, internal concentration analysis did not indicate a potential relation of the low sensitivity of fish embryos to a limited uptake of the compounds. Analysis of locomotor activity of diquat dibromide and the neurotoxic compounds in 98 hpf embryos (exposed for 96 h) indicated a specific effect on behavior (embryonic movement) for the neurotoxic compounds. The EC(50)s of behavior for neurotoxic compounds were close to the acute fish toxicity LC50. Our data provided the first evidence that the applicability domain of the fish embryo test (LC(50)s determination) may exclude neurotoxic compounds. However, neurotoxic compounds could be identified by changes in embryonic locomotion. Although a quantitative prediction of acute fish toxicity LC50 using behavioral assays in fish embryos may not yet be possible, the identification of neurotoxicity could trigger the conduction of a conventional fish acute toxicity test or application of assessment factors while considering the very good fish embryo-acute fish toxicity correlation for other compounds.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of Microcystis aeruginosa in the early life stages of zebrafish
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that cyanotoxins can exert neurotoxic effects on exposed aquatic organisms but most studies have focused on purified toxins rather than on the more complex effects of cyanobacterial blooms. To evaluate this issue in an environmentally relevant model, we assessed the developmental neurotoxicity induced by Microcystis aeruginosa on newly hatched zebrafish. After four days of exposure, the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae was significantly decreased with increasing algae concentration. The levels of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and dopamine (DA) were decreased, accompanied by a decline in ache, chrna7 and wolf and a compensatory increase in nr4a2b transcription. Furthermore, the expression of nine marker genes for nervous system function or development, namely, elavl3, gap43, gfap, mbp, nestin, ngn1, nkx2.2a, shha and syn2a, similarly decreased after algal exposure. These results demonstrated that Microcystis aeruginosa exposure affected cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, the transcription of key nervous system genes, and consequently the activity level of larval zebrafish. Importantly, discrepancies in the neurotoxic effects observed in this study and in previous reports that were based on exposure to pure cyanotoxin highlight the necessity for further investigation of cyanobacterial bloom mixtures when assessing the ecotoxicity of cyanobacteria.

TI  - Chlorpyrifos exposure of developing zebrafish: effects on survival and long-term effects on response latency and spatial discrimination
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used insecticide, which has been shown to interfere with neurobehavioral development. Rat models have been key in demonstrating that prenatal CPF exposure causes choice accuracy deficits and motor alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary nonmammalian models can be useful in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the persisting behavioral effects of developmental CPF exposure. Zebrafish with their clear chorion and extensive developmental information base provide an excellent model for assessment of molecular processes of toxicant impacted neurodevelopment. To facilitate the use of the zebrafish model and to compare it to the more typical rodent models, the behavioral phenotype of CPF toxicity in zebrafish must be well characterized. Our laboratory has developed methods for assessing spatial discrimination learning in zebrafish, which can differentiate response latency from choice accuracy in a three chambered fish tank. Low and high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml on days 1-5 postfertilization) both had significant persisting effects on both spatial discrimination and response latency over 18 weeks of testing. The high, but not the low dose, significantly accelerated mortality rates of the fish during the study from 20-38 weeks of age. Developmental exposure to either 10 or 100 ng/ml of CPF caused significant spatial discrimination impairments in zebrafish when they were adults. The impairment caused by 10 ng/ml was seen during early but not later testing, while the impairment caused by 100 ng/ml became more pronounced with continued testing. The higher dose caused a more pervasive impairment. The 10 and 100 ng/ml doses had opposite effects on response latency. The low 10 ng/ml dose significantly slowed response latency, while the high 100 ng/ml dose significant increased response latency. Both of these effects diminished with continued testing. CPF exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments, which lasted throughout adulthood in zebrafish. The molecular mechanisms by which early developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral impairments expressed in adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish model.

TI  - Extended fish short term reproduction assays with the fathead minnow and Japanese medaka: No evidence of impaired fecundity from exposure to atrazine
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Short-term reproduction assays were conducted with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to evaluate responses from atrazine exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations and above. Breeding groups of fish with multiple males and females were exposed to atrazine under flow-through conditions. Fathead minnows were exposed to mean measured concentrations of 1.0, 10, 26, 52, and 105 mu g atrazine/L for 28 days. Medaka were exposed to mean measured concentrations of 9.4, 48, 74, 97, and 244 mu g atrazine/L for 28 or 29 days. Fish were evaluated for survival, fecundity, fertility, total length, wet weight, secondary sex characteristics, gonadosomatic index (GSI) (P. promelas only), plasma or hepatic vitellogenin (VTG), and histopathology of gonads. General observations of health and behaviour were also conducted. There were no statistically significant effects (i.e., p < 0.05) of atrazine on survival, size, reproduction, behaviour, GSI, VTG, or secondary sex characteristics in either species at any exposure level. In fathead minnows, there were no histopathological findings associated with atrazine exposure in male fish, but there was an increased proportion of Stage 4.0 ovaries accompanied by an increase in proportion of Grade 3 post-ovulatory follicles in females of the 105 a treatment group. Without a concomitant increase in oocyte atresia, neither of these findings are considered adverse for the health of the fish. In medaka, there were no significant effects of atrazine exposure on histopathology in either sex. These data support current weight-of-evidence assessments that atrazine does not cause direct adverse effects on fish reproduction at environmentally realistic concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fluazinam impairs oxidative phosphorylation and induces hyper/hypo-activity in a dose specific manner in zebrafish larvae
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Fluazinam is a pyridinamine fungicide that induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in cells, and it has been reported to be neurotoxic. To characterize the biological effects of fluazinam, we assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics, dopamine system expression, and behavior of early life staged zebrafish (0.01 mu M-0.5 mu M) Fluazinam at environmentally-relevant levels did not induce sub-lethal effects in larvae, but at the LC50 (0.5 mu M), fluazinam decreased basal and ATP-linked respiration significantly in embryos. As mitochondria are directly related to redox homeostasis and apoptosis, the expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured. Superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), heat stock protein 70 (hsp70), bcl2-associated X protein (bax), and caspase 9 (casp9) mRNA levels were up-regulated by 0.5 mu M fluazinam. Taken together, there was evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage at the highest concentration of fluazinam (0.5 pM) tested. As there are reports for fluazinam-induced neurotoxicity in dopamine synthesizing cells, transcriptional targets in the dopamine system were assessed in the zebrafish. Tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine receptor 2a (drd2a) mRNA levels were decreased by 0.5 mu M fluazinam, suggesting that this fungicide may affect the dopaminergic system. To further assess the potential for fluazinam-mediated neuromodulation, the dark photokinesis response was assessed in larvae following exposure. Larvae exposed to 0.1 mu M fluazinam showed hyperactivity, while larvae exposed to 0.2 and 03 mu M showed hypo-activity. This study demonstrates that fluazinam disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics in zebrafish, inducing an oxidative stress response, and aberrant behaviors in larvae that are dose dependent.

TI  - Developmental exposure to an organophosphate flame retardant alters later behavioral responses to dopamine antagonism in zebrafish larvae
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Human exposure to organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) is widespread, including pregnant women and young children with whom developmental neurotoxic risk is a concern. Given similarities of OPFRs to organophosphate (OP) pesticides, research into the possible neurotoxic impacts of developmental OPFR exposure has been growing. Building upon research implicating exposure to OP pesticides in dopaminergic (DA) dysfunction, we exposed developing zebrafish to the OPFR tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), during the first 5 days following fertilization. On day 6, larvae were challenged with acute administration of dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptor antagonists and then tested in a light-dark locomotor assay. We found that both developmental TDCIPP exposure and acute dopamine D-1 and D-2 antagonism decreased locomotor activity separately. The OPFR and DA effects were not additive; rather, TDCIPP blunted further D-1 and D-2 antagonist-induced decreases in activity. Our results suggest that TDCIPP exposure may be disrupting dopamine signaling. These findings support further research on the effects of OPFR exposure on the normal neurodevelopment of DA systems, whether these results might persist into adulthood, and whether they interact with OPFR effects on other neurotransmitter systems in producing the developmental neurobehavioral toxicity.

TI  - Atrazine exposure in zebrafish induces aberrant genome-wide methylation
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most common agricultural herbicide used in the United States and is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). Developmental exposure to ATZ can lead to significant behavioral and morphological alterations in exposed animals and their progeny suggesting the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism. Specific epigenetic mechanisms responsible for these alterations, however, are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb (mu g/L) of ATZ from 1 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf). Chemical exposure was ceased and zebrafish maintained until 9 months post fertilization (mpf), when wholegenome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed to assess the effects of embryonic ATZ exposure on DNA methylation in female fish brains. The number of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) increased with increasing treatment concentration. DMGs were enriched in neurological pathways with extensive methylation changes consistently observed in neuroendocrine pathways. Specifically, DMGs with methylation changes in promoter regions showed hypomethylation in estrogen receptor signaling and hypermethylation in androgen signaling. DMGs with methylation changes in genebody were primarily enriched for mitochondrion-related pathways associated with healthy aging. Integrated analysis with transcriptomic data at 9 mpf exhibited a similar trend identifying CABLES1 and NDUFA4 as shared targets at all concentrations. We then compared the predicted upstream regulators of transcriptomic changes with DMGs and identified CALML3 as a common upstream regulator at both 0.3 and 30 ppb that exhibit significant methylation changes. Collectively, our study identified long-lasting DNA methylation changes in genome after embryonic ATZ exposure and elucidated potential gene targets whose aberrant methylation features may drive alterations in gene transcription in long-term.

TI  - Responses of the zebrafish hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis PCR array to prochloraz are dependent on timing of sampling
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - A PCR array, based on expression of genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver(HPGL) axis of fish, has been suggested as a useful method for screening of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). However, effects of circadian rhythm on responses of the HPGL axis to exposure to chemicals were unknown. In this study, profiles of expression of genes along the HPGL axis and concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in blood plasma of female zebrafish were compared at two sampling times of day (8:00 AM and 7:00 PM). Prochloraz (PCZ) was selected as a model chemical to evaluate differences in responses of the HPGL axis at these two times of day. Profiles of responses of concentrations of E2 in plasma and expressions of genes along the HPGL axis genes were different between the two times of sampling. Concentrations of E2 were less, and abundances of mRNA for several genes along the HPGL axis were significantly greater or lesser when samples were collected at 7:00 PM than they were when samples were collected at 8:00 AM. Exposure to three concentrations of PCZ (3, 30 or 300 mu g/L) for 48 h resulted in significantly lesser concentrations of plasma E2 and caused compensatory up-regulation of genes included in hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary. Expressions of genes along the HPGL were more responsive to PCZ at 8:00 AM than they were when samples were collected at 7:00 PM. Correlations among parameters in samples collected at the two times indicated the effects might be due to different concentrations of E2 in plasma due to exposure to PCZ. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The toxicity of chlorpyrifos on the early life stage of zebrafish: A survey on the endpoints at development, locomotor behavior, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most toxic pesticides in aquatic ecosystem, but its toxicity mechanisms to fish are still not fully understood. This study examined the toxicity targets of CPF in early life stage of zebrafish on the endpoints at developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity. Firstly, CPF exposure decreased the body length, inhibited the hatchability and heart rate, and resulted in a number of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and pericardial edema (PE), in larval zebrafish. Secondly, the free swimming activities and the swimming behaviors of the larvae in response to the stimulation of light-to-dark photoperiod transition were significantly influenced by the exposure to 100 and 300 mu g/L CPF. In addition, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the transcription of some genes related to neurotoxicity were also influenced by CPF exposure. Thirdly, CPF exposure induced oxidative stress in the larval zebrafish. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased and the glutathione (GSH) contents decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner after the exposure to CPF for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). CPF affected not only the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), but also the transcriptional levels of their respective genes. Finally, the mRNA levels of the main cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf alpha), interferon (Ifn), interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta), interleukin 6 (116), complement factor 4 (C4) in the larvae increased significantly after the exposure to 100 or 300 mu g/L CPF for 96 hpf, suggesting that the innate immune system disturbed by CPF in larvae. Taken together, our results suggested that CPF had the potential to cause developmental toxicity, behavior alterations, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in the larval zebrafish.

TI  - Enantioselective bioaccumulation of hexaconazole and its toxic effects in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Little is known about the bioaccumulation and toxicity of hexaconazole (HEX) in spite of the fact that they are indispensable parts for a comprehensive assessment of its environmental behavior and toxic effects in organisms of freshwater ecosystems. In this study, adult zebrafish were used to study the enantioselective bioaccumulation of HEX and its effect endpoints in liver, including oxidative stress and the regulation of apoptosis-related gene expression. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was demonstrated when exposed to HEX of 100 and 200 mu g L-1, finding that the ()-enantiomer tended to accumulate in zebrafish more easily than (+)-enantiomer. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and GSH content were all significantly decreased when zebrafish were exposed to 50 and 200 mu g L-1 HEX for 21 d. A series of genes of the apoptosis pathway were examined in groups treated with 50 and 200 mu g L-1 HEX for 21 d using real-time PCR. Significant up-regulation of p53, Puma, Apaf-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio were proved. The overall results indicated that waterborne HEX was able to produce oxidative stress and induce apoptosis through the involvement of caspases in adult zebrafish. The above information will play a vital role in the integrated environmental risk assessment of HEX and make its toxic mechanism in fish clear. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lambda-cyhalothrin-loaded nanocapsules pose an unacceptable acute toxicological risk to zebrafish (Danio rerio) at the adult and larval stages but present an acceptable risk to embryos
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Recently, size-controlled pesticide microcapsule (MC) delivery systems have played an important role in precision farming development; however, the potential environmental hazards of MCs with different particle sizes have not been fully characterized. In this study, we prepared a series of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC)-MCs with nano and micron-scale capsule sizes (average diameters of 209.4 nm, MC-N; 2.41 mu m, MC-S; 4.87 mu m, MC-M; and 12.41 mu m, MC-L). The assessment results showed that the release and sedimentation behavior of LC-MCs in water and toxicity to zebrafish at three life stages were all particle size-dependent. As the diameter distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale (similar to 27 mu m), the capsules released more slowly and sunk more quickly in water. In addition, micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in significantly less fish mortality and malformations of larvae and embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The highest accumulation of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae suggested that the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would pose unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms. The obvious toxicological differences of LC-MCs toward aquatic organisms implies that regulating MC production in an appropriate size range is an important prerequisite for achieving efficient but safe pesticide applications.

TI  - Triadimefon triggers circling behavior and conditioned place preference/ aversion in zebrafish in a dose dependent manner
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Triadimefon (TDF) is a pesticide used in agricultural crops to control powdery mildews, rusts and other fungal pests. It exerts its fungicidal activity through the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, impairing the formation of the cell membrane. For vertebrates, one of its side effects is the binding to the dopamine transporter increasing the levels of synaptic dopamine, similarly to cocaine. In addition, it has been demonstrated that TDF affects the abundance of other monoamines in the brain, specifically serotonin. It is well known that drugs which alter the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems produce behavioral changes and participate in the development of addictions in mammals. In this work we have used the conditioned place preference paradigm to assess, for the first time, the rewarding properties of TDF in zebrafish. We found out that TDF triggers both, preference and aversion depending on the dosage used during conditioning. We observed that 5 mg/L produced aversion to the pattern previously paired with TDF. However, 15 mg/L induced the opposite behavior, showing that zebrafish seek out those environments which had previously been paired with the higher dose of TDF. These results are congruent with our previous findings, where we showed that 5 mg/L reduced the levels of serotonin, usually linked to anxious behaviors (a negative cue), whereas higher concentrations of TDF increased extracellular dopamine, the main currency of the reward system. Interestingly, both doses of TDF induced circling behavior, a feature usually seen in glutamatergic antagonists.

TI  - Combined effects of flow speed and sub-lethal insecticide exposure on predator-prey interactions between the California killifish and an infaunal polychaete
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Hydrodynamics and pollution affect estuarine populations, but their ecological effects have rarely been studied in combination. We conducted two laboratory experiments to quantify whether predator-prey interactions between California killifish, Fundulus parvipinnis, and the polychaete Polydora cornuta vary with flow speed and chlorpyrifos exposure. In one experiment, only F. parvipinnis was exposed to chlorpyrifos; in the other, only P. cornuta was exposed. The flume included a 300-cm(2) area of sediment with 24P. cornuta in a central patch (98cm(2)). We videotaped groups of three killifish for 50min at one of four flow speeds (6, 9, 12, or 15cm/s) and recorded the proportion of bites directed at the prey patch. Unexposed killifish directed 70% of their bites at the prey patch at 6cm/s, and prey-patch selection decreased as flow increased. Killifish exposed to chlorpyrifos directed 41% of their bites at the prey patch at 6cm/s with reduced prey-patch selection relative to unexposed fish at 9 and 12cm/s. At 15cm/s, both exposed and unexposed fish displayed non-selective biting. Worms were videotaped to quantify their deposit- and suspension-feeding activities. Exposing worms to chlorpyrifos reduced total feeding activity by similar to 30%. Suspension feeding was more common at faster flow speeds, but the time worms spent suspension feeding relative to deposit feeding was unaffected by chlorpyrifos. No behavioral changes were noted in either species when the other was exposed to chlorpyrifos. This study highlights how hydrodynamic conditions can alter the relative importance of a toxicant's effects on predator-prey interactions.

TI  - Enantioselective Dissipation, Residue, and Risk Assessment of Diniconazole Enantiomers in Four Kinds of Fruits
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - Chiral diniconazole is a widely used triazole fungicide, while its enantioselective behaviors in fruits have not been reported. In this article, the absolute configuration was confirmed. A fast supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method was developed for the chiral separation and enantioselective study of diniconazole in four kinds of fruits. The residual concentrations gradually decreased with time in four kinds of fruits after applying diniconazole. The dissipation half-lives of R-diniconazole and S-diniconazole were in the range of 5.3-7.9 and 2.5-7.1 days respectively, and S-diniconazole was degraded preferentially. The residue concentrations were lower than the EU's MRL (0.01 mg/kg) on the 40th (harvest time), 30th, and 10th day in pear, jujube, and apple, respectively. But, in peach, residue concentrations were still higher than the MRL after 60 days and the ratio of R/S was 2.2. These results could be helpful for the reasonable use and risk assessment of chiral diniconazole.

TI  - Inferring variance and invariance in multi-individual behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio) responding to chemical stress
T2  - ANIMAL CELLS AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Variance and invariance residing in multi-individual movement of zebrafish under chemical stress were addressed concurrently before and after treatment with formaldehyde. Variance was observed in movement parameters. Without treatment, linear speed was highest in groups with two-individuals, followed by those with one- and four-individuals. Following treatment, linear speed decreased significantly in groups with one- and two-individuals, but not in those with four-individuals. Inter-distances between two-individuals in groups with two-individuals decreased markedly after treatment, whereas inter-distances between two randomly selected individuals in the groups with four-individuals were not affected. The zero- and peak-values in the time-lag of autocorrelation of inter-distances decreased further after treatment in groups of two individuals relative to those in groups of four individuals. However, the empirical transition probability matrix between predefined behavioral patterns remained invariant among groups with different numbers of individuals as well as before and after treatment. Variance and invariance in multi-individual behaviors are suitable in expressing complex behaviors under chemical stress and could be a reference for detecting contaminants in the environment using indicator species.

TI  - Sleep deprivation caused a memory defects and emotional changes in a rotenone-based zebrafish model of Parkinson's disease
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world. Apart from motor deficits, PD reduces patient's quality of life through sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment and emotional disorders. However, it's unclear whether bad life habits such as stay up late exacerbate the patient's cognition and emotional disorders. Thus we investigated the consequences of sleep deprivation (SD) on memory and emotions using a rotenone-based zebrafish model of PD. Behavioral assays, using locomotor activity assay, showed that rotenone treated zebrafish exhibited PD-like symptoms, whereas sleep deprivation didn't exacerbate the progression of them. The object discrimination task exhibited that the short-term cognitive deficits of rotenone group are more serious than the sham group after SD. Light-dark box test showed that rotenone treated fish are more dysphoric than the sham fish after SD. Dopamine and DOPAC significantly reduced in rotenone treated fish compared with the sham fish. However, this DOPAC reduction recovered after SD. The expression of D2 and D3 in rotenone treated zebrafish elevated compared with sham group and SD group. However, the rotenone treated zebrafish manifested a decrease level of D2 and D3 after SD. Dl did not show any significantly changes among the four groups. Our findings suggest that zebrafish treated with rotenone may have a more severe damage of memory and emotional function after SD, which may be related to the changes in the DA systems.

TI  - Developmental Neurotoxicity and Behavioral Screening in Larval Zebrafish with a Comparison to Other Published Results
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - With the abundance of chemicals in the environment that could potentially cause neurodevelopmental deficits, there is a need for rapid testing and chemical screening assays. This study evaluated the developmental toxicity and behavioral effects of 61 chemicals in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae using a behavioral Light/Dark assay. Larvae (n = 16-24 per concentration) were exposed to each chemical (0.0001-120 mu M) during development and locomotor activity was assessed. Approximately half of the chemicals (n = 30) did not show any gross developmental toxicity (i.e., mortality, dysmorphology or non-hatching) at the highest concentration tested. Twelve of the 31 chemicals that did elicit developmental toxicity were toxic at the highest concentration only, and thirteen chemicals were developmentally toxic at concentrations of 10 mu M or lower. Eleven chemicals caused behavioral effects; four chemicals (6-aminonicotinamide, cyclophosphamide, paraquat, phenobarbital) altered behavior in the absence of developmental toxicity. In addition to screening a library of chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity, we also compared our findings with previously published results for those chemicals. Our comparison revealed a general lack of standardized reporting of experimental details, and it also helped identify some chemicals that appear to be consistent positives and negatives across multiple laboratories.

TI  - The Effects of Maternal Atrazine Exposure and Swimming Training on Spatial Learning Memory and Hippocampal Morphology in Offspring Male Rats via PSD95/NR2B Signaling Pathway
T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Atrazine (ATR), a widely used herbicide, has been previously shown to damage spatial memory capability and the hippocampus of male rats during the development. It has also been indicated that physical exercise can improve learning and memory in both humans and animals, as a neuroprotective method. Our aim here was to investigate the effect of maternal ATR exposure during gestation and lactation on spatial learning and memory function and hippocampal morphology in offspring and to further evaluate the neuroprotective effect of swimming training and identify possible related learning and memory signaling pathways. Using Sprague-Dawley rats, we examined behavioral and molecular biology effects associated with maternal ATR exposure, as well as the effects of 8 or 28 days swimming training. Maternal exposure to ATR was found to impair spatial learning and memory by behavioral test, damage the hippocampal morphology, and reduce related genes and proteins expression of learning and memory in the hippocampus. The extended, 28 days, period of swimming training produced a greater amelioration of the adverse effects of ATR exposure than the shorter, 8 days, training period. Our results suggest that maternal ATR exposure may damage the spatial learning and memory of offspring male rats via PSD95/NR2B signaling pathway. The negative effect of ATR could be at least partially reversed by swimming training, pointing to a potential neuroprotective role of physical exercise in nervous system diseases accompanying by learning and memory deficit.

TI  - Improved antifungal activity and reduced aquatic toxicity of fludioxonil by complexation with beta-cyclodextrin
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB  - Poor water solubility results in limited fungicidal bioavailability and poses a great risk to non-target organisms due to the use of organic solvent in formulation processing. Here, the water solubility of fludioxonil (Flu) was improved by generating an inclusion complex with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) at 1:1 host-guest stoichiometric ratio. The formation of the inclusion complex was confirmed by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, DSC, and H-1-NMR spectra. Molecular docking simulation found that Flu was imbedded into the beta-CD cavity, folded, and centrally aligned inside. In addition, Flu/beta-CD displayed increased soil mobility, sustained release behavior, and a 2.75-fold increase of the fungicidal activity against Botrytis cinerea. Importantly, the prepared inclusion complex exhibited decreased acute toxicity to phytoplankton (Chlorella vulgaris), zooplankton (Daphnia magna ), and fish (Danio rerio) than technical Flu. This study provided useful information for the rational use of Flu in agriculture, as well as the reduction of ecological risk to the aquatic environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mitochondrial dysfunction-based cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity induced by pyraclostrobin in zebrafish larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Pyraclostrobin is widely used to control crop diseases, and was reported to be highly toxic to aquatic organisms. The molecular target of pyraclostrobin to fungus is the mitochondrion, but its effect on mitochondria of aquatic organisms has rarely been investigated. In this study, zebrafish larvae at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) were exposed to a range of pyraclostrobin for 96 h to assess its acute toxicity and effects on mitochondria. Pyraclostrobin at 36 mu g/L or higher concentrations caused significant influences on larval heart and brain including pericardial edema, brain damage malformations, histological and mitochondrial structural damage of the two organs. The results of RNA-Seq revealed that the transcripts of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, cardiac muscle contraction, mitochondrion, nervous system development and glutamate receptor activity were significantly influenced by 36 mu g/L pyraclostrobin. Further tests showed that pyraclostrobin at 18 and 36 mu g/L. reduced the concentrations of proteins related to cardiac muscle contraction, impaired cardiac function, inhibited glutamate receptors activities and suppressed locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. Negative changes in mitochondria( complex activities, as well as reduced ATP content were also observed in larvae treated with 18 and 36 mu g/L pyraclostrobin. These results suggested that pyraclostrobin exposure caused cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae and mitochondrial dysfunction might be the underlying mechanism of pyraclostrobin toxicity.

TI  - Embryonic atrazine exposure elicits proteomic, behavioral, and brain abnormalities with developmental time specific gene expression signatures
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ), the second most commonly used herbicide in the United States, is an endocrine disrupting chemical linked to cancer and a common drinking water contaminant. This study further investigates ATZ-related developmental toxicity by testing the following hypotheses in zebrafish: the effects of embryonic ATZ exposure are dependent on timing of exposure; embryonic ATZ exposure alters brain development and function; and embryonic ATZ exposure changes protein abundance in carcinogenesis-related pathways. After exposing embryos to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion (ppb) ATZ, we monitored the expression of cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (cypl7a1), glyoxalase I (glo1), ring finger protein 14 (rnf14), salt inducible kinase 2 (sik2), tetratricopeptide domain 3 (ttc3), and tumor protein D52 like 1 (tpd52l1) at multiple embryonic time points to determine normal expression and if ATZ exposure altered expression. Only cypl7a1 had normal dynamic expression, but ttc3 and tpd52l1 had ATZ-related expression changes before 72 h. Larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had increased brain length, while larvae exposed to 30 ppb ATZ were hypoactive. Proteomic analysis identified altered protein abundance in pathways related to cellular function, neurodevelopment, and genital-tract cancer. The results indicate embryonic ATZ toxicity involves interactions of multiple pathways.

TI  - Evaluating the Effects of Forestry Herbicides on Fish Development Using Rapid Phenotypic Screens
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Herbicides are used to control invasive or noxious plants on public lands throughout the western United States. These chemicals are often applied in the upper reaches of watersheds that provide spawning and rearing habitat for anadromous species of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., steelhead O. mykiss, and bull trout Salvelinus confluentus. As a consequence, natural resource managers must often weigh the ecological benefits of using herbicides to control nonnative plants against the potential for unintended toxicological impacts on salmonids, particularly during early life stages. However, the effects of chemical control agents on fish development have not been widely investigated. Their use in the vicinity of aquatic habitats, including areas that support threatened and endangered species, is therefore a concern. To address this uncertainty, we used the zebrafish Dania rerio as a model experimental system for investigating developmental toxicity, which involved conducting rapid and sensitive phenotypic screens for potential developmental defects resulting from exposure to six herbicides (picloram, clopyralid, imazapic, glyphosate, imazapyr, and triclopyr) and several technical formulations (Tordon K, Transline, Habitat, Plateau, Garlon 3A, and Renovate). Zebrafish embryos were exposed continuously through 5 d of development at nominal concentrations ranging from 3 mu g/L to 10 mg/L. Detailed screens were used to examine aspects of ontogeny from early development (gastrulation and segmentation) through organogenesis, hatching, and morphology as free-swimming larvae. Growth was measured at the end of each exposure interval. To detect defects in neural development (sensorimotor integration), the escape reflex of larvae was monitored at 3, 4, and 5 d after fertilization. No developmental toxicity was observed in response to the six individual herbicides or the different technical formulations. The absence of toxicity at relatively high exposure concentrations suggests that noxious weed control activities are not likely to pose a direct threat to the health of salmonids at early life stages.

TI  - Tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate exposure to zebrafish causes neurodevelopmental toxicity and abnormal locomotor behavior
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The organophosphate flame retardant, tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), is ubiquitous in environmental matrices; however, there is a paucity of information concerning its systemic toxicity. Herein, we investigated the effects of TCPP exposure on zebrafish neurodevelopment and swimming behavior to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Under TCPP gradient concentration exposure, the hatching rates were declined by up to 33.3% in 72 hpf, and the malformation rates increased from 15% to 50%. Meanwhile, TCPP led to abnormal behaviors including decreased locomotive activity in the dark and slow/insensitive responses to sound and light stimulation of larvae. TCPP caused excessive apoptosis and ROS accumulation in early embryonic development, with hair cell defects and structural deformity of neuromast. Abnormal expression of neurodevelopment (pax6a, nova1, sox11b, syn2a, foxo3a and robo2) and apoptosis-related genes (baxa, bcl2a and casp8) revealed molecular mechanisms regarding abnormal behavioral and phenotypic symptoms. Chronic TCPP exposure led to anxiety-like behavior and excessive panic, lower capacity for discrimination and risk avoidance, and conditioned place preference in adults. Social interaction tests demonstrated that long-term TCPP stress resulted in unsociable, eccentric, lonely and silent behaviors in adults. Zebrafish memory and cognitive function were severely reduced as concluded fromT-maze tests. Potential mechanisms triggering behavioral abnormality were attributed to histopathological injury of diencephalon, abnormal changes in nerve-related genes at transcription and expression levels, and inhibited activity of AChE by TCPP stress. These findings provide an important reference for risk assessment and early warning to TCPP exposure, and offer insights for prevention/mitigation of pollutant-induced nervous system diseases.

TI  - Can Environmentally Relevant Neuroactive Chemicals Specifically Be Detected with the Locomotor Response Test in Zebrafish Embryos?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Chemicals considered as neuroactive (such as certain pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals) are among the largest groups of bioactive substances recently detected in European rivers. However, the determination of nervous-system-specific effects has been limited using in vitro tests or conventional end points including lethality. Thus, neurobehavioral tests using in vivo models (e.g., zebrafish embryo) have been proposed as complementary approaches. To investigate the specificity and sensitivity of a light-dark transition locomotor response (LMR) test in 4 to 5 days post fertilization zebrafish with respect to different modes of action (MoAs), we analyzed a set of 18 environmentally relevant compounds with various anticipated MoAs. We found that exposure-induced behavioral alterations were reproducible and dependent on concentration and time. Comparative and quantitative analyses of the obtained locomotor patterns revealed that behavioral effects were not restricted to compounds primarily known to target the nervous system. A clear distinction of MoAs based on locomotor patterns was not possible for most compounds. Furthermore, chemicals with an anticipated same MoA did not necessarily provoke similar behavioral phenotypes. Finally, we determined an increased sensitivity (>= 10-fold) compared to observed mortality in the LMR assay for five of eight neuroactive chemicals as opposed to non-neuroactive compounds.

TI  - Chronic Treatment with Paraquat Induces Brain Injury, Changes in Antioxidant Defenses System, and Modulates Behavioral Functions in Zebrafish
T2  - MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Paraquat (PQ) administration consists in a chemical model that mimics phenotypes observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), due to its ability to induce changes in dopaminergic system and oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the actions of PQ in behavioral functions of adult zebrafish and its influence on oxidative stress biomarkers in brain samples. PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days (one injection every 3 days). PQ-treated group showed a significant decrease in the time spent in the bottom section and a shorter latency to enter the top area in the novel tank test. Moreover, PQ-exposed fish showed a significant decrease in the number and duration of risk assessment episodes in the light-dark test, as well as an increase in the agonistic behavior in the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test. PQ induced brain damage by decreasing mitochondrial viability. Concerning the antioxidant defense system, PQ increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as the non-protein sulfhydryl content (NPSH), but did not change ROS formation and decreased lipid peroxidation. We demonstrate, for the first time, that PQ induces an increase in aggressive behavior, alters non-motor patterns associated to defensive behaviors, and changes redox parameters in zebrafish brain. Overall, our findings may serve as useful tools to investigate the interaction between behavioral and neurochemical impairments triggered by PQ administration in zebrafish.

TI  - Sub-lethal toxicity assessment of the phenylurea herbicide linuron in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo/larvae
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Due to run-off and rain events, agrochemicals can enter water catchments, exerting endocrine disruption effects and toxicity to aquatic organisms. Linuron is a phenylurea herbicide used to control a wide variety of vegetative weeds in agriculture in addition to residential applications. However, there are few studies that quantify its toxicity to early developmental stages of fish. The objectives of this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to zebrafish embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities, oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the Visual Motor Response test. Zebrafish embryos at similar to 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one dose of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mu M linuron for up to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) depending on the assay. Zebrafish larvae exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using the Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf embryos at 20 mu M after a 24-hour exposure. In 7 dpf larvae, transcript abundance was determined for 6 transcripts that have a role in oxidative respiration (atp06, cox1, cox4-1, cox5a1, cytb, and nd1); the relative abundance of these transcripts was not altered with linuron treatment. A Visual Motor Response test was conducted on 7 dpf larvae to determine whether linuron (0.625 to 5 mu M) impaired locomotor activity. Larval activity in the dark period decreased in a dose dependent manner and there were indications of hypoactivity as low as 1.25 mu M. Transcript abundance was thus determined for tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad1b), two rate limiting enzymes that control the production of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. The mRNA levels of gad1b = 0.019) were reduced with increasing concentrations of linuron while th1 (p = 0.056) showed a similar decreasing trend, suggesting that neurotransmitter biosynthesis may be altered with exposure to linuron. This study improves knowledge related to the toxicity mechanisms for linuron and is the first to demonstrate that this anti-androgenic chemical impairs oxidative respiration and exerts neurotoxic effects associated with neurotransmitter biosynthesis during early development. These data are significant for environmental risk assessment of agrochemicals.

TI  - Developmental chlorpyrifos effects on hatchling zebrafish swimming behavior
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a widely used organophosphate insecticide and potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, interferes with neurobehavioral development. Rat models have been key in demonstrating that developmental CPF exposure causes learning deficits and locomotor activity alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary nonmammalian models can be useful in determining the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying these persisting behavioral effects. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) with their clear chorion and extensive developmental information base provide an excellent model for assessment of molecular processes of toxicant-impacted neurodevelopment. We have developed methods for assessing spatial discrimination learning in adult zebrafish and have documented persisting effects of developmental CPF exposure on swimming activity and learning after low and high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml) administered to zebrafish embryos on Days 1-5 postfertilization (pf). In the current study, we developed methods for behavioral assessment of CPF exposure on swimming activity in newly hatched zebrafish. An equal area segmented annular grid (concentric circles divided into quadrants through the diameter) was made in a 16-mm diameter cylinder. The test area was placed on a heating device secured to an Olympus SZH 10 dissecting scope stage. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 10 ng/ml CPF, 100 ng/ml CPF, or vehicle control (25 [mul/ml DMSO) (n=8-10/treatment group). Each treatment group was kept in a total volume of 25 ml of egg water (60 mg/ml Instant Ocean) including DMSO with or without CPF mixed to above dilutions in an incubator set at 28.5degreesC. CPF dilutions or vehicle were changed daily with exposure ending on Day 5 pf. Testing of larval zebrafish was performed on Days 6 and 9 pf. The fish were placed in the test cylinder with 1.5 ml of egg H(2)0 (28.5degreesC). After a 2-min acclimation period, the swimming activity of the fish was measured for a 3-min testing session. The 100 ng/ml CPF dose caused significant slowing of swimming activity on Days 6 and 9 pf and had persisting effects of impairing spatial discrimination and decreasing response latency in adulthood. Developmental exposure to 10 ng/ml of CPF did not cause a significant change in locomotor activity during the period soon after hatching. CPF exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments detectable during the posthatching period. In a previous study, we found that early developmental CPF exposure caused behavioral alterations in zebrafish, which lasted throughout adulthood. The molecular mechanisms by which early developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral impairments expressed in adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Low-dose cadmium stress increases the bioaccumulation and toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers in zebrafish (Danio rerio)?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Co-occurrence of pesticides and heavy metals has attracted extensive attention. The enantioselective behaviors of dinotefuran to aquatic organisms have not been reported, and the effects of cadmium (Cd) was absent, which were investigated in this study at environmentally relevant concentrations. The enantioselective accumulation and elimination of dinotefuran enantiomers were observed in zebrafish, and it had tissue specificity. The S-dinotefuran concentrations were higher than R-dinotefuran in heads and viscera, but it was opposite in muscles. There existed competition between S-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran, and the existence of S-dinotefuran might decrease the accumulation and elimination of the R-dinotefuran in zebrafish. When co-exposure to Cd and dinotefuran, the accumulation concentrations of dinotefuran enantiomers increased in zebrafish at the initial stage, which were opposite latterly. The accumulation concentrations of R-dinotefuran in R + Cd treatment in fish were 3.4 times higher than those in R-dinotefuran treatment, and the enantiomer fraction (EF) values changed from 0.484 to 0.195. The oxidative stress of S-dinotefuran on zebrafish was highest, followed by rac- and R-dinotefuran. Coexposure to Cd led to toxicity increase for R-dinotefuran, the malonaldehyde (MDA) content decreased significantly in R + Cd treatment during 7-28 days, while obvious declination of MDA contents was found on the 28th day in R-dinotefuran treatment. Furthermore, compared to R-dinotefuran treatment, Cd increased the relative expression of cz-sod (3.4 times), cas3 (1.6 times) and p53 (5.7 times) in R + Cd treatment. The co-exposure of Cd might alter the environmental behaviors and toxicity effects of dinotefuran enantiomers in zebrafish, including the enantioselectivity. The effects of Cd on accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran were greater than those on S-dinotefuran. Thus, it is necessary to consider the effects of coexistent metals to chiral pesticides in ecological risk. Summarizes: The enantioselective accumulation and elimination of dinotefuran enantiomers had tissue specificity. Cd increased the accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran in zebrafish.

TI  - Determination of the targeted carbendazim metabolites in zebrafish water tank by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Carbendazim, a common pesticide, has shown signs of causing cancer, infertility and toxicity to organisms. Due to its intense use, this fungicide has become a persistent compound in the environment, raising the importance of better understanding its behaviour, metabolic pathways and effects on organisms. Zebrafish is considered an excellent animal model, being able to rapidly absorb compounds in water, mimicking what occurs in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate carbendazim metabolites in zebrafish water tank using liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) to highlight analytical targets in order to monitor carbendazim exposure in aquatic environments. For this purpose, treatment, negative and stability groups were defined. In addition, water samples were collected from the tanks and analyses were carried out by LC-HRMS. The results allowed the putative annotation of 7 target metabolites. This study applied the analysis of zebrafish water tank for evaluation of target metabolites of carbendazim as a promising approach, since it is a much cleaner matrix than the usual biological matrices. These metabolites can ensure detectability and further strengthen confidence in monitoring carbendazim exposure in aquatic environments. To the best of our knowledge, there is no one study that has evaluated carbendazim metabolites produced by zebrafish, neither in the animal's body nor in the water tank. This is the first report on the generation of carbendazim metabolites by zebrafish.

TI  - Exposure to acetochlor impairs swim bladder formation, induces heat shock protein expression, and promotes locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Acetochlor is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, however, there are few data on the sub-lethal effects of acetochlor on early developmental stages of fish. To address this, we measured survival, deformity, swim bladder formation, embryo oxygen consumption rates, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, transcripts (related to swim bladder formation, oxidative damage response, and apoptosis) and behavior responses following exposure to acetochlor (0.001 mu M up to 125 mu M). Exposure to acetochlor at concentrations 50 mu M and above exerted 100% mortality after 3 dpf, and significantly reduced the size of the swim bladder (25 mu M). In embryos, basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production, and maximal respiration were decreased 30-60% following a 24 h exposure to 125 mu M acetochlor. Acetochlor did not affect ROS levels up to 25 mu M in larvae with acute exposure. Acetochlor at 25 mu M increased mRNA levels of bax1, hsp70, and hsp90a by similar to 4-fold in larval zebrafish. In both the visual motor response and light-dark preference test, 25 mu M acetochlor increased locomotor activity of larval fish. At lower exposure concentrations, 100 and 1000 nM acetochlor increased the mean time spent in the dark zone, suggesting promotion of anxiolytic behavior. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of sublethal effects of acetochlor, spanning molecular responses to behavior, which can be used to refine risk assessment decisions for aquatic environments.

TI  - Acute toxicity of broflanilide on neurosecretory system and locomotory behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Broflanilide, a novel meta-diamide insecticide, possesses moderate acute toxicity to zebrafish, with a 96-h median lethal concentration (96-LC50) of 0.76 mg/L. However, its effect on fish behavior and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of broflanilide on the zebrafish brain over a 96-h exposure by comparing the histopathological changes and relative expression of targeted genes with the behavioral metrics. The results of the toxicity test showed that broflanilide could cause deformities, such as deformation of the operculum and spinal curvature, at 0.6, 0.82 and 1.15 mg/L. Results also showed tissue damage and apoptosis in the cerebellum under 0.27 and 0.6 mg/L exposure. Additionally, broflanilide affected the neurotransmitters, metabolites and transcripts of genes associated with dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid expression. and the signaling pathways in zebrafish brains at 0.60 mg/L after 1 h and 96 h of exposure, while the levels of glutamate, glutamate decarboxylase, GABA transaminase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were also inhibited at 0.27 mg/L after 96 h of exposure. The accumulated swimming distance was significantly longer and the average speed was significantly faster than the control at 0.27 and 0.6 mg/L after 1-h of exposure, while these metrics were lowered at 0.6 mg/L after 96 h of exposure. The study results demonstrates that broflanilide affects the zebrafish brain, neurotransmitters and associated fish behaviors. This study also provides deeper insight into the mechanistic understanding of the effects of broflanilide on the zebrafish brain.

TI  - An embryonic atrazine exposure results in reproductive dysfunction in adult zebrafish and morphological alterations in their offspring
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The herbicide atrazine, a suspected endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), frequently contaminates potable water supplies. Studies suggest alterations in the neuroendocrine system along the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis; however, most studies address either developmental, pubertal, or adulthood exposures, with few investigations regarding a developmental origins hypothesis. In this study, zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion (ppb) atrazine through embryogenesis and then allowed to mature with no additional chemical exposure. Reproductive function, histopathology, hormone levels, offspring morphology, and the ovarian transcriptome were assessed. Embryonic atrazine exposure resulted in a significant increase in progesterone levels in the 3 and 30 ppb groups. A significant decrease in spawning and a significant increase in follicular atresia in the 30 ppb group were observed. In offspring, a decrease in the head length to body ratio in the 30 ppb group, along with a significant increase in head width to body ratio in the 0.3 and 3 ppb groups occurred. Transcriptomic alterations involved genes associated with endocrine system development and function, tissue development, and behavior. This study provides evidence to support atrazine as an EDC causing reproductive dysfunction and molecular alterations in adults exposed only during embryogenesis and morphological alterations in their offspring.

TI  - Movement Patterning of Daphnia magna Treated with Copper Based on Self-Organizing Map - 18TH BIENNIAL ISEM CONFERENCE ON ECOLOGICAL MODELLING FOR GLOBAL CHANGE AND COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEM
AB  - A heavy metal, copper, was exposed to indicator species, Daphnia magna in fresh water. Response behaviors were accordingly monitored by using models for pattern recognition. With computer interfacing techniques movement of indicator species was continuously observed in response to Cu2+ at low concentrations before (24 hours) and after (24 hours) the treatments. The movement tracks in 2-dimension were segmented into a short unit (30s). The parameters (e. g., speed, stop number and meander) in the movement data were trained with Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to classify behavioral patterns under the stressful condition of chemical treatments. The patterns in the designated time unit accordingly revealed the structural properties of movement data under the chemical stress. This study further suggested that models of pattern recognition such as SOM could be a useful tool in analyzing complex behavioral patterns of indicator species and in monitoring heavy metal exposure in environment in situ.

TI  - The role of nanoplastics on the toxicity of the herbicide phenmedipham, using Danio rerio embryos as model organisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Once in the aquatic ecosystems, nanoplastics (NPls) can interact with other contaminants acting as vectors of transport and altering their toxicological effects towards organisms. Thus, the present study aims to investigate how polystyrene NPls (44 nm) interact with the herbicide phenmedipham (PHE) and affect its toxicity to zebrafish embryos. Single exposures to 0, 0.015, 0.15, 1.5, 15 and 150 mg/L NPls and 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg/L PHE were performed. Embryos were also exposed to the binominal combinations: 0.015 mg/L NPls + 2 mg/L PHE, 0.015 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE, 1.5 mg/L NPls + 2 mg/L PHE and 1.5 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE. Due to the low solubility of PHE in water, a solvent control was performed (0.01% acetone). PHE was quantified. Mortality, heartbeat and hatching rate, malformations appearance, locomotor behavior and biomarkers related to oxidative stress, neurotransmission and energy budgets were analyzed. During 96 h, NPls and PHE single and combined exposures did not affect embryos development. After 120 h, NPls induced hyperactivity and PHE induced hypoactivity. After 96 h, NPls increased catalase activity and PHE increased glutathione S-transferases activity. On the combination 0.015 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE, hyperactivity behavior was found, similar to 0.015 mg/L NPls, and cholinesterase activity was inhibited. Additionally, the combination 1.5 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE increased both catalase and glutathione S-transferases activities. The combination NPls with PHE affected more biochemical endpoints than the single exposures, showing the higher effect of the binominal combinations. Dissimilar interactions effects - no interaction, synergism and antagonism - between NPls and PHE were found. The current study shows that the effects of NPls on bioavailability and toxicity of other contaminants (e.g. PHE) cannot be ignored during the assessment of NPls environmental behavior and risks.

TI  - Xenopus laevis tadpoles exposed to metamifop: Changes in growth, behavioral endpoints, neurotransmitters, antioxidant system and thyroid development
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Pesticides are a major cause of the reduction in the global amphibian population. In this study, the acute toxicity and chronic effects of metamifop on Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) tadpoles were investigated. The 96 h-LC50 value of metamifop on X. laevis tadpoles was 0.634 mg/L, which indicated that metamifop was highly toxic to tadpoles. In the chronic toxicity study, tadpoles were exposed to 0.063 mg/L of metamifop. After 14, 21 and 35 d of exposure, metamifop significantly inhibited the body weight and neurotransmitter synthesis of tadpoles, caused abnormal behavior and interfered with fat metabolism. According to the results of antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde (MDA), tadpoles exposed to 0.063 mg/L metamifop suffered severe lipid oxidative damage. Compared with the control group, the thyroid hormone (TH) levels and related gene expression in tadpoles in the treatment group were affected, reflecting the endocrine interference effect of metamifop. The data of this study can enrich our knowledge of the effects of aryloxyphenoxy propionate pesticides on amphibians and highlight the role of metamifop and other pesticides play in global decline of amphibians.

TI  - Developmental Exposure to Low Concentrations of Organophosphate Flame Retardants Causes Life-Long Behavioral Alterations in Zebrafish
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - As the older class of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are phased out of commercial use because of findings of neurotoxicity with developmental exposure, a newer class of flame retardants have been introduced, the organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Presently, little is known about the potential for developmental neurotoxicity or the behavioral consequences of OPFR exposure. Our aim was to characterize the life-long neurobehavioral effects of 4 widely used OPFRs using the zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); or one of the following treatments; isopropylated phenyl phosphate (IPP) (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mu M); butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP) (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 mu M); 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) (0.03, 0.3, 1 mu M); isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDDP) (0.1, 0.3,1, 10 mu M) from 0- to 5-days postfertilization. On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the exposed fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to assess emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction and predator evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term effects of altered motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds, and long-term impairment of anxiety-related behavior in adults following IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures. Our results show that OPFRs may not be a safe alternative to the phased-out BFRs and may cause behavioral impacts throughout the lifespan. Further research should evaluate the risk to mammalian experimental models and humans.

TI  - Dietary Contaminants and Their Effects on Zebrafish Embryos
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Dietary contaminants are often an over-looked factor in the health of zebrafish. Typically, water is considered to be the source for most contaminants, especially within an aquatic environment. For this reason, source water for zebrafish recirculating systems is highly regulated and monitored daily. Most facilities use reverse osmosis or de-ionized water filtration systems to purify incoming water to ensure that contaminants, as well as pathogens, do not enter their zebrafish housing units. However, diets are rarely tested for contaminants and, in the case of manufactured zebrafish feeds, since the product is marketed for aquaculture or aquarium use it is assumed that the feed is acceptable for animals used for research. The following provides examples as to how contaminants could lead to negative effects on development and behavior of developing zebrafish.

TI  - Zebrafish as an in vivo model for sustainable chemical design
T2  - GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Heightened public awareness about the many thousands of chemicals in use and present as persistent contaminants in the environment has increased the demand for safer chemicals and more rigorous toxicity testing. There is a growing recognition that the use of traditional test models and empirical approaches is impractical for screening for toxicity the many thousands of chemicals in the environment and the hundreds of new chemistries introduced each year. These realities coupled with the green chemistry movement have prompted efforts to implement more predictive-based approaches to evaluate chemical toxicity early in product development. While used for many years in environmental toxicology and biomedicine, zebrafish use has accelerated more recently in genetic toxicology, high throughput screening (HTS), and behavioral testing. This review describes major advances in these testing methods that have positioned the zebrafish as a highly applicable model in chemical safety evaluations and sustainable chemistry efforts. Many toxic responses have been shown to be shared among fish and mammals owing to their generally well-conserved development, cellular networks, and organ systems. These shared responses have been observed for chemicals that impair endocrine functioning, development, and reproduction, as well as those that elicit cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity, among other diseases. HTS technologies with zebrafish enable screening large chemical libraries for bioactivity that provide opportunities for testing early in product development. A compelling attribute of the zebrafish centers on being able to characterize toxicity mechanisms across multiple levels of biological organization from the genome to receptor interactions and cellular processes leading to phenotypic changes such as developmental malformations. Finally, there is a growing recognition of the links between human and wildlife health and the need for approaches that allow for assessment of real world multi-chemical exposures. The zebrafish is poised to be an important model in bridging these two conventionally separate areas of toxicology and characterizing the biological effects of chemical mixtures that could augment its role in sustainable chemistry.

TI  - The efficacy of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA R-A) subtype-selective positive allosteric modulators in blocking tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS)-induced seizure-like behavior in larval zebrafish with minimal sedation
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The chemical threat agent tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA AR) antagonist that causes life threatening seizures. Currently, there is no specific antidote for TETS intoxication. TETS-induced seizures are typically treated with benzodiazepines, which function as nonselective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of synaptic GABAARs. The major target of TETS was recently identified as the GABAAR alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2 subtype in electrophysiological studies using recombinantly expressed receptor combinations. Here, we tested whether these in vitro findings translate in vivo by comparing the efficacy of GABAAR subunit-selective PAMs in reducing TETS-induced seizure behavior in larval zebrafish. We tested PAMs targeting alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 2/3/5, alpha 6, ss2/3, ss1/2/3, and delta subunits and compared their efficacy to the benzodiazepine midazolam (MDZ). The data demonstrate that alpha 2- and alpha 6-selective PAMs (SL-651,498 and SB-205384, respectively) were effective at mitigating TETS-induced seizure-like behavior. Combinations of SB-205384 and MDZ or SL-651,498 and 2-261 (ss2/3-selective) mitigated TETS-induced seizure-like behavior at concentrations that did not elicit sedating effects in a photomotor behavioral assay, whereas MDZ alone caused sedation at the concentration required to stop seizure behavior. Isobologram analyses suggested that SB-205384 and MDZ interacted in an antagonistic fashion, while the effects of SL-651,498 and 2-261 were additive. These results further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TETS induces seizures and provide mechanistic insight regarding specific countermeasures against this chemical convulsant.

TI  - Toxic effects of glyphosate on the intestine, liver, brain of carp and on epithelioma papulosum cyprinid cells: Evidence from in vivo and in vitro research
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Glyphosate (GLY) is the most widely used organophosphorus herbicide in agriculture. The present study aimed to analyze the comprehensive toxicological effects of GLY on juvenile common carp and an epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cell line. In the in vivo experiments, exposure to GLY (5 and 15 mg/L) for 30 days induced liver inflammation and oxidative damage in common carp and changed the physical barrier of the intestine. Histopathological analysis of the intestine, liver, brain, and changes in oxidative stress biomarkers provided evidence of damage and immune system responses to GLY. Moreover, an inhibitory effect of 15 mg/L GLY on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was found in the brain, which may be an important reason for the significant decrease in both swimming distance and average acceleration of common carp. Cell experiments showed that 0.65 and 3.25 mg/L GLY inhibited the viability of EPCs. Furthermore, oxidative DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were observed in EPC cells following GLY exposure. Taken together, this study not only highlights the negative effects of GLY on common carp but also enriches the knowledge of the cytotoxicity mechanism to further clarify the comprehensive toxicity of GLY in common carp.

TI  - Stress, growth, cytokines and histopathological effects of permethrin in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)
T2  - CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
AB  - Although permethrin has low toxicity in mammals, it affects many aquatic organisms directly or indirectly due to its high insecticide potential. In this study, changes in the levels of some hormones, cytokines and histopathological effects in the gill and liver were studied in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed to permethrin at different doses (0, 10 and 20 ppm) and durations (4 days and 21 days). Permethrin exposure showed significant (P < 0.05) elevation in the serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) while decrease in growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in duration- and concentration dependent-manner compared to the control group. Histopathological findings such as reduction in secondary interlamellar space in the gill tissue, shortening of secondary lamellae, merging, fusion, oedema and telangiectasia were obtained. In the liver tissue, histopathological symptoms such as vacuolization of hepatocytes, passive hyperaemia, mononuclear cell infiltration and hepatocellular degeneration were observed. As a result, it was determined that permethrin had a toxic effect on common carp depending on the dose and duration exposure.

TI  - Effects of low-dose chlorpyrifos on neurobehavior and potential mechanisms: A review of studies in rodents, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans
T2  - BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives Exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a neurotoxic insecticide, is implicated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children through noncholinergic mechanisms. Methods This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Results CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10-14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (<= 1.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition. Conclusions Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms. Variability in laboratories, exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal species/strain might have contributed to the inconsistent results. The detrimental CPF effects during early development are relevant to human populations.

TI  - The organophosphate pesticide -OP- malathion inducing thyroidal disruptions and failures in the metamorphosis of the Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundOrganophosphate pesticides-OP-, like malathion, can alter the normal functioning of neuro-endocrine systems (e.g., hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid-HPT- axis), and to interfere on the thyroidal homeostasis. Through direct interactions with thyroid receptors, an/or indirectly via up-stream signalling pathways, from the HPT axis (i.e., negative feedback regulation), malathion possess the ability to affect integrity of thyroidal follicular tissue, and it can also block or delay its hormonal functioning. This insecticide can alter the majority of the ontogenetic processes, inducing several deformities, and also provoking decreases in the growth and survival patterns. The present study has been performed to determine the sublethal effects of malathion during the first month of life of the Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis, and it is mainly focused on the metamorphosis phase. Different transcript expression levels (i.e. thyroid receptors, matrix and bone -Gla-proteins) and immunohistochemical patterns (i.e. thyroid hormones, osteocalcin, cell proliferation) have been analysed during the most critical phases of the flatfish metamorphosis, that is, through differentiation of thyroid system and skeletal development, migration of the eye, and further adaptation to benthic behaviours.ResultsIn early life stages of the Senegalese sole, the exposure to the highest concentration of malathion (6.25g/L) affected to the growth patterns, showing the exposed individuals, a reduction around 60 and 92% of the total length and the dry weigth, respectively. In paralell, a significant reduction of the thyroid follicles (i.e., size and number) it was also been recorded, in a dose-dependent way. Abnormal phenotypes induced in the exposed larvae, did not complete the process of metamorphosis, and displayed several morphological abnormalities and developmental disorders, which were mainly associated with the eye migration process, and with thyroidal and skeletal disorders (i.e., transcriptional and protein changes of thyroid hormones and receptors, and of matrix and bone Gla proteins distribution), that conduced to an inadequate adaptation to the benthic life.ConclusionsIn the Senegalese sole, the majority of the ontogenetic alterations induced by the exposure to malathion were mainly associated to the metamorphosis period, which is a thyroid-driven proccess. In fact, most crucial and transitional ontogenic events, appeared notably disturbed, for e.g., thyroid gland differentiation and functioning, migration of eye, skeletal development and benthonic behaviors.

TI  - HSP90 and pCREB alterations are linked to mancozeb-dependent behavioral and neurodegenerative effects in a marine teleost
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The pesticide mancozeb (mz) is recognized as a potent inducer of oxidative stress due to its ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species plus inhibiting mitochondrial respiration thus becoming an environmental risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite numerous toxicological studies on mz have been directed to mammals, attention on marine fish is still lacking. Thus, it was our intention to evaluate neurobehavioral activities of ornate wrasses (Thalassoma pavo) exposed to 0.2 mg/I of mz after a preliminary screening test (0.07-0.3 mg/I). Treated fish exhibited an evident (p < 0.001) latency to reach T-maze arms (> 1000%) while exploratory attitudes (total arm entries) diminished ( 50%; p < 0.05) versus controls during spontaneous exploration tests. Moreover, they showed evident enhancements (+ 111%) of immobility in the cylinder test. Contextually, strong (-88%; p < 0.01) reductions of permanence in light zone of the Light/Dark apparatus along with diminished crossings (-65%) were also detected. Conversely, wrasses displayed evident enhancements (160%) of risk assessment consisting of fast entries in the dark side of this apparatus. From a molecular point of view, a notable activation (p < 0.005) of the brain transcription factor pCREB occurred during mz-exposure. Similarly, in situ hybridization supplied increased HSP90 mRNAs in most brain areas such as the lateral part of the dorsal telencephalon (DI; + 68%) and valvula of the cerebellum (VCe; +35%) that also revealed evident argyrophilic signals. Overall, these first indications suggest a possible protective role of the early biomarkers pCREB and HSP90 against fish toxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prokaryotic expression of human-sourced and zebrafish-sourced protein kinase A alpha catalytic subunits combined with in vitro and in silico assay
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - The extensively studied cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is involved in the regulation of critical cell processes, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell proliferation. Therefore, PKA has been viewed increasingly as potential target for variety of drugs and environmental endocrine disruptors. Consequentially, the preparation of PKA protein became an important initial step for the subsequent exploration of PKA's character in endocrine disrupting effects of pesticides. To investigate PKA protein, which is potential to be the environmental endocrine toxicity target of triazole fungicides, a strategy to heterologously express protein kinase A catalytic alpha subunit of human (hPKAc alpha) and zebrafish (zPKAc alpha) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21(DE3) host cells was demonstrated. After optimizing conditions and protein purification, we successfully obtained enzymatically active hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha. Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha still retained their characteristic antigenicity and binding activity, while in vitro kinase activity assays revealed that the recombinant hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha maintained enzyme activity. By in silico methods including homology modelling and molecular docking, the affinity of ligands and the models of hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha were further tested. The present study offered a valuable method to achieve the prokaryotic expression of a eukaryotic protein kinase and laid a foundation to facilitate further investigation of toxicological target of triazole pesticides.

TI  - Global responses to tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) in rockfish Sebastes schlegeli using integrated proteomic and metabolomic approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As alternatives of brominated flame retardants, organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) can be detected in multiple marine environmental media. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) was one of the most frequently and abundantly detected OPFRs in the Bohai Sea. Exposure to TCPP has been shown to induce abnormal behavior in zebrafish as well as neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, there is a lack of mechanism investigations on the toxic effects of TCPP at molecular levels. In this work, proteomics and metabolomics were integrated to analyze the proteome and metabolome responses in rockfish Sebastes schlegeli treated with TCPP (10 and 100 nM) for 15 days. A total of 143 proteins and 8 metabolites were significantly altered in rockfish following TCPP treatments. The responsive proteins and metabolites were predominantly involved in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, signal transduction, cellular transport, cholesterol metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification. Furthermore, a hypothesized network of proteins, metabolites, and pathways in rockfish was summarized based on the combination of proteomic and metabolomic results, showing some key molecular events in response to TCPP. Overall, the present study unraveled the molecular responses at protein and metabolite levels, which provided a better understanding of toxicological effects and mechanisms of TCPP in marine teleost.<bold> </bold>

TI  - Disruption of sex-hormone levels and steroidogenic-related gene expression on Mongolia Racerunner (Eremias argus) after exposure to triadimefon and its enantiomers
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Triadimefon (TF) is a widely used chiral fungicide with one chiral centre and two enantiomers (TF1 and TF2). However, little is reported about the ecological toxicity of reptiles on an enantioselective level. TF is a potential endocrine disruptor that may interfere with sex steroid hormones, such as testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E-2). In our study, the lizards Mongolia Racerunner (Eremias argus) were orally exposed to TF and its enantiomers for 21 days. Plasma sex steroid hormones and steroidogenic-related genes, including 17-beta-hydroxysteroid (hsd17 beta), cytochrome P450 enzymes (cyp19 and cyp17), and steroid hormone receptors (era and Ar) were evaluated. After exposure, the plasma testosterone level in the 100 mg/kg(bw) group was elevated, while the oestradiol level was reduced. This phenomenon may be caused by the transformation of cyp19, which may inhibit the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol and affect sexual behaviour. In addition, the two enantiomers have different effects on hormone levels, which testified to the previously reported biotoxic dissimilarity between TF1 and TF2 in organisms. Furthermore, the cyp19 mRNA level in liver and gonad of the TF2 and TF group (100 mg/kg(bw) were significantly down-regulated, while the cyp17 and hsd17 beta mRNA levels were up-regulated. The expression of era and Ar mRNA levels were up-regulated in males but not in females, which may indicate that TF has sex differences on these two genes. As seen from the above results, TF and its enantiomers may have endocrine-disrupting effects on lizards (E. argus) by acting sensitively on sex steroid hormones and steroidogenic-related genes.

TI  - Teratological and Behavioral Screening of the National Toxicology Program 91-Compound Library in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - To screen the tens of thousands of chemicals for which no toxicity data currently exists, it is necessary to move from in vivo rodent models to alternative models, such as zebrafish. Here, we used dechorionated Tropical 5D wild-type zebrafish embryos to screen a 91-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for developmental toxicity. This library contained 86 unique chemicals that included negative controls, flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), drugs, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Fish were exposed to 5 concentrations of each chemical or an equal amount of vehicle (0.5% DMSO) in embryo medium from 6h post-fertilization (hpf) to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Fish were examined daily for mortality and teratogenic effects and photomotor behavior was assessed at 4 and 5 dpf. Of the 5 negative control compounds in the library, none caused mortality/teratogenesis, but two altered behavior. Chemicals provided in duplicate produced similar outcomes. Overall, 13 compounds caused mortality/teratology but not behavioral abnormalities, 24 only affected behavior, and 18 altered both endpoints, with behavior affected at concentrations that did not cause mortality/teratology (55/86 hits). Of the compounds that affected behavior, 52% caused behavioral abnormalities at either 4 or 5 dpf. Compounds within the same functional group caused different behavioral abnormalities, while similar behavioral patterns were caused by compounds from different groups. Our data suggest that behavior is a sensitive endpoint for developmental toxicity screening that integrates multiple modes of toxic action and is influenced by the age of the larval fish at the time of testing.

TI  - Assessment of the developmental and neurotoxicity of the mosquito control larvicide, pyriproxyfen, using embryonic zebrafish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - In 2014, as an attempt to address the Zika health crisis by controlling the mosquito population, Brazil took the unprecedented action of applying a chemical larvicide, pyriproxyfen, to drinking water sources. The World Health Organization has established an acceptable daily intake of pyriproxyfen to be 100 mu g per kg of body weight per day, but studies have demonstrated that at elevated doses (>5000 mg/kg), there are adverse effects in mice, rats and dogs. To better understand the potential developmental toxicity of pyriproxyfen, we utilized the embryonic zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that the concentration resulting in 50% of animals presenting adverse morphological effects (EC50), including craniofacial defects, was 5.2 mu M for daily renewal exposure, and above this concentration, adverse behavioral effects were also observed in animals that followed a static exposure regimen. Thus, zebrafish data suggest that the developmental toxicity of pyriproxyfen may not be limited to insects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Varying modalities of perinatal exposure to a pesticide cocktail elicit neurological adaptations in mice and zebrafish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Epidemiological indications connect maternal and developmental presence or exposure to pesticides with an increased risk for a spectrum of neurological trajectories. To provide pre-clinical data in support of this hypothesis, we used two distinct experimental models. First, female and male mice were fed immediately prior to mating, and the resulting pregnant dams were continously fed during gestation and lactation periods using chow pellets containing a cocktail of six pesticides at tolerable daily intake levels. Male and female offspring were then tracked for behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological adaptations. Second, a zebrafish model allowed us to screen toxicity and motor-behavior outcomes specifically associated with the developmental exposure to a low-to-high concentration range of the cocktail and of each individual pesticide. Here, we report anxiety-like behavior in aging male mice maternally exposed to the cocktail, as compared to age and gender matched sham animals. In parallel, in vivo electrocorticography revealed a decrease in gamma (40-80 Hz) and an increase of theta (6-9 Hz) waves, delineating a long-term, age-dependent, neuronal slowing. Neurological changes were not accompanied by brain structural malformations. Next, by using zebrafish larvae, we showed an increase of all motor behavioral parameters resulting from the developmental exposure to 10 mg/L of pesticide cocktail, an outcome that was not associated with midbrain structural or neurovascular modifications as assessed by in vivo 2-photon microscopy. When screening each pesticide, chlorpyrifos elicited modifications of swimming parameters at 0.1 mg/L, while other components provoked changes from 0.5 mg/L. Ziram was the single most toxic component inducing developmental malformations and mortality at 10 mg/L. Although we have employed non-equivalent modalities and timing of exposure in two dissimilar experimental models, these outcomes indicate that presence of a pesticide cocktail during perinatal periods represents an element promoting behavioral and neurophysiological modifications. The study limitations and the possible pertinence of our findings to ecotoxicology and public health are critically discussed (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Toxicological Assessment of a Lignin Core Nanoparticle Doped with Silver as an Alternative to Conventional Silver Core Nanoparticles
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - Elevated levels of silver in the environment are anticipated with an increase in silver nanoparticle (AgNP) production and use in consumer products. To potentially reduce the burden of silver ion release from conventional solid core AgNPs, a lignin-core particle doped with silver ions and surface-stabilized with a polycationic electrolyte layer was engineered. Our objective was to determine whether any of the formulation components elicit toxicological responses using embryonic zebrafish. Ionic silver and free surface stabilizer were the most toxic constituents, although when associated separately or together with the lignin core particles, the toxicity of the formulations decreased significantly. The overall toxicity of lignin formulations containing silver was similar to other studies on a silver mass basis, and led to a significantly higher prevalence of uninflated swim bladder and yolk sac edema. Comparative analysis of dialyzed samples which had leached their loosely bound Ag+, showed a significant increase in mortality immediately after dialysis, in addition to eliciting significant increases in types of sublethal responses relative to the freshly prepared non-dialyzed samples. ICP-OES/MS analysis indicated that silver ion release from the particle into solution was continuous, and the rate of release differed when the surface stabilizer was not present. Overall, our study indicates that the lignin core is an effective alternative to conventional solid core AgNPs for potentially reducing the burden of silver released into the environment from a variety of consumer products.

TI  - Strategies of cellular energy allocation to cope with paraquat-induced oxidative stress: Chironomids vs Planarians and the importance of using different species
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Paraquat (PQ) is still used in several countries worldwide as an herbicide for weed control in agricultural production, ponds, reservoirs and irrigation canals. Thus, PQ is frequently found in surface water systems and is potentially toxic to aquatic organisms, since it can cause mitochondrial dysfunction altering in the redox state of cells. This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of PQ to Chironomus riparius and Girardia tigrina, and compare their physiological strategies to cope with environmental stress. The mean emergence time was the most sensitive endpoint for Chironomids, with the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) being 0.02 for males and 0.1 mg PQ L-1 for females. Moreover, PQ reduced the body weight of male and female imagoes, with LOECs of 0.5 and 2.5 mg PQ L-1, respectively. Paraquat also decreased the respiration rate (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) and total glutathione (tGSH) content (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1). Thus, the aerobic production of energy was not affected and allowed chironomids to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ, but with consequent physiological costs in terms of development rates and weight of adults. In planarians, PQ decreased the locomotion and feeding activity, and delayed photoreceptor regeneration (LOECs = 2.5 mg PQ L-1 for all endpoints). Despite increased aerobic energy production (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1), planarians were not able to cope with oxidative stress induced by the highest PQ concentrations, since lipid peroxidation levels were significantly increased (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) concomitantly with a significant decrease of tGSH (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1). These results showed that planarians were unable to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ with consequent impairments of behavior and regeneration despite an increased aerobic energy production.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the hexane extract of S. mombin (EHSm) in an experimental model of DP induced by rotenone in zebrafish. The analysis of GC/MS demonstrated cyclogallipharaol (13.88%) and dl-alpha-tocopherol (8.08%) mostly, while HPLC-DAD indicated the presence of quercetin (<5), quercetrin (6.54 mg/g) and rutin (8.83 mg/g). The zebrafish exposed for 4 weeks to rotenone (ROT, 3 mu g/L) and EHSm (5, 15, 25 mg/L). EHSm (25 mg/L) was able to reverse the behavioral damage induced by ROT in the entries and time spent in the top area of the tank. The parameters biochemicals indicated of EHSm prevented oxidative stress (TBARS e total thiols), inflammation and dopamine uptake triggered by ROT, evidenced of increased on the CAT, SOD and GSH and decreased of GST, O-2(-) production and NADPH oxidase activities. We conclude that EHSm demonstrate a neuroprotector effect mediated through anxiolytic and antioxidant activities. However, more studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the effects of EHSm on DP induced by rotenone in zebrafish.

TI  - Sodium Selenite Prevents Paraquat-Induced Neurotoxicity in Zebrafish
T2  - MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Considering the antioxidant properties of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and the involvement of oxidative stress events in paraquat-induced neurotoxicity, this study investigated the protective effect of dietary Na2SeO3 on biochemical and behavioral parameters of zebrafish exposed to paraquat (PQ). Fish were pretreated with a Na2SeO3 diet for 21 days and then PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days. In the novel tank test, the Na2SeO3 diet prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the increase in the time spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of freezing episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) tasks, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in the latency to enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of PQ-treated animals, respectively. Na2SeO3 prevented the increase of carbonylated protein (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as the decrease in non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant enzymatic defenses, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary Na2SeO3 improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment in zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety- and aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.

TI  - High-Content Screening Assay for Identification of Chemicals Impacting Spontaneous Activity in Zebrafish Embryos
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Although cell-based assays exist, rapid and cost-efficient high-content screening (HCS) assays within intact organisms are needed to support prioritization for developmental neurotoxicity testing in rodents. During zebrafish embryogenesis, spontaneous tail contractions occur from late-segmentation (similar to 19 h postfertilization, hpf) through early pharyngula (similar to 29 hpf) and represent the first sign of locomotion. Using transgenic zebrafish (flil:egfp) that stably express eGFP beginning at similar to 14 hpf, we have developed and optimized a 384-well-based HCS assay that quantifies spontaneous activity Within single zebrafish embryos after exposure to test chemicals in a concentration-response format. Following static exposure of one embryo per well from 5 to 25 hpf, automated image acquisition procedures and custom analysis protocols were used to quantify total body area and spontaneous activity in live embryos. Survival and imaging success rates across control plates ranged from 87.5 to 100% and 93.3-100%, respectively. Using our optimized procedures, we screened 16 chemicals within the US EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library, and found that exposure to abamectin and emamectin benzoate-both potent avermectins-abolished spontaneous activity in the absence of gross malformations. Overall, compared to existing locomotion-based zebrafish assays conducted later in development, this method provides a simpler discovery platform for identifying potential developmental neurotoxicants.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of the Parkinson Disease-Associated Pesticide Ziram Is Synuclein-Dependent in Zebrafish Embryos
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to the commonly used dithiocarbamate (DTC) pesticides is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD), although the mechanisms by which they exert their toxicity are not completely understood. OBJECTIVE: We studied the mechanisms of zirams (a DTC fungicide) neurotoxicity in vivo. METHODS: Zebrafish (ZF) embryos were utilized to determine zirams effects on behavior, neuronal toxicity, and the role of synuclein in its toxicity. RESULTS: Nanomolar-range concentrations of ziram caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior. Because ziram increases alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF gamma-synuclein 1 (gamma 1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms, and ZF gamma 1 appears to be the closest functional homologue to alpha-syn. We found that recombinant ZF gamma 1 formed fibrils in vitro, and overexpression of ZF gamma 1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity in a manner similar to that of alpha-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF gamma 1 with morpholinos and disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 prevented zirams DA toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ziram is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo, and this toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which pesticides may cause PD.

TI  - High levels of halogenated natural products in large pelagic fish from the Western Indian Ocean
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Concentrations, profiles and muscle-liver distribution of halogenated natural products (HNPs) and anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were investigated in five large pelagic fish species and one smaller planktivore fish species from the Western Indian Ocean. Analysis of swordfish muscle from the Seychelles revealed the predominance of HNPs, with the highest concentrations found for 2 `-methoxy-2,3 `,4,5 `- tetraBDE (2 `-MeO-BDE 68 or BC-2), 6-methoxy-2,2 `,4,4 `- tetraBDE (6-MeO-BDE 47 or BC-3) and 2,3,3 `,4,4 `,5,5 `-heptachloro-1 `-methyl-1,2 `-bipyrrole (Q1), along with varied contributions of further HNPs. The mean concentration of n-ary sumation HNPs (330 ng/g lw) was one or two orders of magnitude higher than n-ary sumation DDTs (60 ng/g lw) and n-ary sumation PCBs (6.8 ng/g lw). HNPs (BC-2, BC-3 and Q1) were also predominant in individual samples of three tropical tuna species from the Seychelles and from other regions of the Western Indian Ocean (Mozambique Channel, off Somalia and Chagos Archipelago). Non-targeted gas chromatography coupled with electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry operated in the selected ion monitoring mode (GC/ECNI-MS-SIM) analysis of one swordfish sample indicated low abundance of rarely reported HNPs (three hexachloro-1 `-methyl-1,2 `-bipyrrole (Cl-6-MBP) isomers and pentabromo-1,1 `-dimethyl-2,2 `-bipyrroles (Br-5-DBP)) but no further abundant unscreened polyhalogenated compounds.

TI  - Eco-friendly Water-Based λ-Cyhalothrin Polydopamine Microcapsule Suspension with High Adhesion on Leaf for Reducing Pesticides Loss.
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - Recently, innovations of nano/microcarrier formulations have been focused on improving application efficiencies and retention time. In this study, a water-based 2.5% λ-cyhalothrin (LC) microcapsule suspension (CS) was developed by orthogonal test with biodegradable and adhesive polydopamine (PDA) microcapsules (MCs) as carriers. The obtained LC-PDA CS had good suspension properties, flow behavior, storage stability, and rheological properties. LC-PDA CS had higher retention, wettability, and decreased rainwater washing out on the leaves than commercial CS. LC-PDA CS displayed higher insecticidal activity against Lipaphis erysimi compared to commercial CS. LC-PDA CS reduced the toxicity of LC to the aquatic organism Danio rerio compared to LC. The above results demonstrated that LC-PDA CS would be eco-friendly water-based pesticides carrier system for prolonging the retention time on target leaf and reducing toxicity to aquatic organisms.

TI  - Novel aspects of uptake patterns, metabolite formation and toxicological responses in Salmon exposed to the organophosphate esters-Tris(2-butoxyethyl)- and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Given the compound differences between tris(2-butoxyethyl)- and tris(2-cloroethyl) phosphate (TBOEP and TCEP, respectively), we hypothesized that exposure of juvenile salmon to TBOEP and TCEP will produce compound-specific differences in uptake and bioaccumulation patterns, resulting in potential formation of OH-metabolites. Juvenile salmon were exposed to waterborne TCEP or TBOEP (0.04, 0.2 and 1 mg/L) for 7 days. The muscle accumulation was measured and bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated, showing that TCEP was less accumulative and resistant to metabolism in salmon than TBOEP. Metabolite formations were only detected in TBOEP-exposed fish, showing seven phase I biotransformation metabolites with hydroxylation, ether cleavage or combination of both reactions as important metabolic pathways. In vitro incubation of trout S9 liver fraction with TBOEP was performed showing that the generated metabolite patterns were similar to those found in muscle tissue exposed in vivo. However, another OH-TBOEP isomer and an unidentified metabolite not present in in vivo exposure were observed with the trout S9 incubation. Overall, some of the observed metabolic products were similar to those in a previous in vitro report using human liver microsomes and some metabolites were identified for the first time in the present study. Toxicological analysis indicated that TBOEP produced less effect, although it was taken up faster and accumulated more in fish muscle than TCEP. TCEP produced more severe toxicological responses in multiple fish organs. However, liver biotransformation responses did not parallel the metabolite formation observed in TBOEP-exposed fish.

TI  - Development and application of the adverse outcome pathway framework for understanding and predicting chronic toxicity: II. A focus on growth impairment in fish
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) organize knowledge on the progression of toxicity through levels of biological organization. By determining the linkages between toxicity events at different levels, AOPs lay the foundation for mechanism-based alternative testing approaches to hazard assessment. Here, we focus on growth impairment in fish to illustrate the initial stages in the process of AOP development for chronic toxicity outcomes. Growth is an apical endpoint commonly assessed in chronic toxicity tests for which a replacement is desirable. Based on several criteria, we identified reduction in food intake to be a suitable key event for initiation of middle-out AOP development. To start exploring the upstream and downstream links of this key event, we developed three AOP case studies, for pyrethroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and cadmium. Our analysis showed that the effect of pyrethroids and SSRIs on food intake is strongly linked to growth impairment, while cadmium causes a reduction in growth due to increased metabolic demands rather than changes in food intake. Locomotion impairment by pyrethroids is strongly linked to their effects on food intake and growth, while for SSRIs their direct influence on appetite may play a more important role. We further discuss which alternative tests could be used to inform on the predictive key events identified in the casp studies. In conclusion, our work demonstrates how the AOP concept can be used in practice to assess critically the knowledge available for specific chronic toxicity cases and to identify existing knowledge gaps and potential alternative tests.

TI  - Behavioral and mutagenic biomarkers in tadpoles exposed to different abamectin concentrations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - It is known that pesticides such as abamectin (ABA) present cytotoxic effects on target organisms; however, the effects from ABA on non-target organisms such as amphibians are poorly understood. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the exposure of Lithobates catesbeianus tadpoles to different abamectin concentrations [12.5, 25, and 50% of the median lethal concentration (LC50)] leads to behavioral and morphological changes and/or generates possible cytotoxic effects. The aggregation test showed that tadpoles exposed to the highest ABA concentrations did not respond to the stimulus from non-familial and unrelated co-specific species. On the other hand, there was no difference in the total number of crossings in the central line of the herein adopted apparatus between groups; it suggests that ABA did not affect animal locomotion in the aforementioned test, although changes in the normal swimming pattern of tadpoles exposed to the pesticide were recorded in the swimming activity test. In addition, the herein exposed animals did not respond to the predatory stimulus in the antipredator response test; this result suggests defensive response deficit caused by the pesticide. With respect to their oral morphology, tadpoles exposed to ABA presented the lowest scores for mandibular pigmentation and structures, as well as for dentition condition. Finally, it was possible seeing that the exposure to ABA, even at the lowest concentration (12.5% of the LC50), resulted in nuclear changes in the erythrocytes of the animals; these changes became evident in the increased number of micronuclei and in other nuclear abnormalities. Thus, besides confirming the cytotoxic potential of ABA in amphibians, the current study corroborates the hypothesis that the exposure to the herein investigated pesticide leads to behavioral and morphological changes in tadpoles, fact that may negatively reflect on the survival, as well as on natural populations of these individuals.

TI  - Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Induce Developmental Toxicity During Zebrafish Embryogenesis, Especially in the Inner Ear
T2  - MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - In vertebrates, carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play important roles in ion transport and pH regulation in many organs, including the eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, and inner ear. In aquatic organisms, the enzyme is inhibited by various chemicals present in the environment, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. In this study, the effects of CA inhibitors, i.e., sulfonamides [ethoxyzolamide (EZA), acetazolamide (AZA), and dorzolamide (DZA)], on zebrafish embryogenesis were investigated. In embryos treated with the sulfonamides, abnormal development, such as smaller otoliths, an enlarged heart, an irregular pectoral fin, and aberrant swimming behavior, was observed. Especially, the development of otoliths and locomotor activity was severely affected by all the sulfonamides, and EZA was a consistently stronger inhibitor than AZA or DZA. In the embryos treated with EZA, inner ear hair cells containing several CA isoforms, which provide HCO3 (-) to the endolymph for otolith calcification and maintain an appropriate pH there, were affected. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining indicated that the hair cell damage in the inner ear and pectral fin is due to apoptosis. Moreover, RNA measurement demonstrated that altered gene expression of cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-related proteins p53, p21, p27, and Bcl-2 occurred even at 0.08 ppm with which normal development was observed. This finding suggests that a low concentration of EZA may affect embryogenesis via the apoptosis pathway. Thus, our findings demonstrated the importance of potential risk assessment of CA inhibition, especially regarding the formation of otoliths as a one of the most sensitive organs in embryogenesis.

TI  - The enantioselective enrichment, metabolism, and toxicity of fenoxaprop-ethyl and its metabolites in zebrafish
T2  - CHIRALITY
AB  - To investigate the impacts of the widely used chiral herbicide fenoxaprop-ethyl (FE) on aquatic organisms, the enrichment, metabolism, acute toxicity, and oxidative stress of fenoxaprop-ethyl and its main metabolites fenoxaprop (FA), ethyl-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propanoate (EHPP), 2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propanoic acid (HPPA), and 6-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzoxazol-2-one (CDHB) in zebrafish were studied. The enantioselectivity of fenoxaprop-ethyl and its chiral metabolites was also determined. Fenoxaprop-ethyl quickly degraded in zebrafish by aquatic exposure. FA, HPPA, and CDHB were the main metabolites that were enriched in the zebrafish. In the metabolism experiment, the half-lives of the metabolites were 0.92-1.72 days in zebrafish. The R-enantiomers of FA and HPPA were preferentially enriched and metabolized with enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of 0.65-0.85. According to the 96-h acute toxicity, FA, HPPA, EHPP, and CDHB were less toxic to zebrafish than FE, following the order of FE > CDHB > EHPP > FA > HPPA. The S-enantiomers of FE, FA, CDHB, and EHPP were more toxic than the R-enantiomers. FE and its metabolites could significantly increase catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in gill and liver tissues, indicating their oxidative stress, and these effects were also enantioselective. This work could supply more information for evaluating the risks of fenoxaprop-ethyl on aquatic organisms concerning their metabolites and enantiomers.

TI  - Application of temporal self-organizing maps to patterning short-time series of fish behavior responding to environmental stress
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Response behaviors of animals to stressors are complicated. Especially, it is difficult to analyze temporal data in addressing the time course development of behavioral states to stressors. Not much study has been conducted in identifying the short-term behavior conditions of indicator organisms responding to stressors. Hence, in the present study, we selected three temporal networks, Temporal Kohonen Map (TKM), Recurrent Self-Organizing Map (RSOM), and Recursive Self-Organizing Map (RecSOM) to characterize the behavior strength of individual fish exposed to Atrazine (ATZ, 0.12 mg/L) for 15 days. The trained networks were able to detect the characteristic behavior strength segments presenting the Stepwise Behavior Response Model (SBRM). TKM was found suitable for detecting strong curves in a short training time, but clustering was limited in grouped segments. In contrast, RecSOM was found to be most suitable for detecting behavior segments with both high and low contrast response under toxic exposure. RecSOM was effective in clustering but could not detect segments with strong changes. Finally, our results presented that the temporal SOMs, especially RecSOMs, were feasible in identifying short-term time series data and could be utilized for on-line monitoring of test organisms under stressful conditions.

TI  - Dopaminergic Co-Regulation of Locomotor Development and Motor Neuron Synaptogenesis is Uncoupled by Hypoxia in Zebrafish
T2  - ENEURO
AB  - Hypoxic injury to the developing human brain is a complication of premature birth and is associated with long-term impairments of motor function. Disruptions of axon and synaptic connectivity have been linked to developmental hypoxia, but the fundamental mechanisms impacting motor function from altered connectivity are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of hypoxia on locomotor development in zebrafish. We found that developmental hypoxia resulted in decreased spontaneous swimming behavior in larva, and that this motor impairment persisted into adulthood. In evaluation of the diencephalic dopaminergic neurons, which regulate early development of locomotion and constitute an evolutionarily conserved component of the vertebrate dopaminergic system, hypoxia caused a decrease in the number of synapses from the descending dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT) to spinal cord motor neurons. Moreover, dopamine signaling from the DDT was coupled jointly to motor neuron synaptogenesis and to locomotor development. Together, these results demonstrate the developmental processes regulating early locomotor development and a requirement for dopaminergic projections and motor neuron synaptogenesis. Our findings suggest new insights for understanding the mechanisms leading to motor disability from hypoxic injury of prematurity.

TI  - Fish behavior: A promising model for aquatic toxicology research
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Fish behaviors have great potential as models for the study of pharmacology, genetics, and neuroscience. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparison of social behavior responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to lethal and sublethal chlorpyrifos concentrations at different exposure times
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most widely used insecticides and has been found in both urban and rural water bodies. In this study, we studied variations in the social behavioral patterns, swimming behavior, and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of Japanese medaka exposed to lethal (0.12 mg/L) and sublethal (0.012 mg/L) concentrations of CPF after different exposure times. Group behavior performance (schooling, shoaling, and solitary) was determined on day 4 of lethal exposure and on days 4, 8, and 12 of sublethal exposure. Swimming speed and brain AChE activity were measured on days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of sublethal CPF exposure. We observed significant decreases in social behavior and swimming speed (i.e., hypoactivity) in fish exposed to lethal CPF concentrations for 4 days. At the sublethal concentration, there was increased schooling duration and hyperactivity of fish on day 8 but not on day 4. In contrast, 12 days of sublethal CPF exposure resulted in social behavior responses similar to those after 4 days' lethal exposure, i.e., significant decreases in schooling frequency and duration with a notable increase in duration of solitary behavior. Brain AChE activity was inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Altered fish behavior in response to organophosphorus pesticides such as CPF may be mediated by more than AChE inhibition alone.

TI  - Optimization of the spontaneous tail coiling test for fast assessment of neurotoxic effects in the zebrafish embryo using an automated workflow in KNIME®.
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Neuroactive chemicals are frequently detected in the environment. At sufficiently high concentrations or within mixtures, they could provoke neurotoxic effects and neurological diseases to organisms and humans. Fast identification of such neuroactive compounds in the environment could help in hazard assessment and risk mitigation. Behavior change is considered as an important endpoint and might be directly or indirectly connected to a neuroactive mode of action. For a fast evaluation of environmental samples and pure substances, we optimized the measurement of a behavioral endpoint in zebrafish embryos - the spontaneous tail coiling (STC). Evaluation of results is automated via the use of a workflow established with the KNIME® software. Analysis duration and developmental stage were optimized to 1 min and 25 ± 1 hpf respectively during measurement. Exposing the embryos in a group of 10 or 20 and acclimatizing for 30 min at room temperature proved to be reliable. The optimized method was used to investigate neurotoxic effects of 18 substances with different modes of action (MoA). The STC test accurately detected the effect of 8 out of 11 neuroactive substances (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon, paraoxon-methyl, abamectin, carbamazepine, propafenone and diazepam). Aldicarb and nicotine showed subtle effects which were considered to be conditional and imidacloprid showed no effect. For substances with unknown neuroactive MoA, 3 substances did not provoke any effect on the STC (pyraclostrobin, diuron and daunorubicin-hydrochloride) while 4 other substances provoked an increased STC (hexaconazole, aniline, dimethyl-sulfoxide and 3,4-dichloroaniline). Such unexpected effects indicate possible neuroactive side effects or unknown mechanisms of action that impact on the STC. In conclusion, the optimized STC parameters and the automated analysis in KNIME® indicate opportunities for the harmonization of the STC test and further development for prospective and diagnostic testing.

TI  - Teleost Model as an Alternative in Parkinson's Disease
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
AB  - In the experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a well-known neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine or MPTP, pesticides like benomyl, paraquat,etc. are successfully used to induce a Parkinson's disease in human and nonhuman primates, which can be reversed by the drugs such as L-DOPA. A review on the alternative methods and alternative models in Parkinson's disease is documented here to understand their advantages and importance. Earlier researchers proved MPTP is effective in the goldfish, which reliably mirrors the neurochemical and behavioral changes caused by MPTP in the higher vertebrates. Gold fish brain has the “nucleus pars medialis,” similar to the substanitia nigra of the human brain can be destructed by chemicals like MPTP, 6-hydroxydopamine and has selective protection by L-Dopa (Levodopa) and MAO-B (Monoamine oxidase B) inhibitors. In addition, zebrafish along with mice was successfully employed in the study of pesticides leading to neurodegeneration in PD. As the current animal models often couldn't replicate the true pathophysiology of idiopathic PD, alternative models have gained importance in the research. Upon having a glance at different models utilized in Parkinson's disease studies, one can get an idea on preferring alternative models, especially the zebra fish model in the study of neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - The Conserved Dopaminergic Diencephalospinal Tract Mediates Vertebrate Locomotor Development in Zebrafish Larvae
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The most conserved part of the vertebrate dopaminergic system is the orthopedia (otp)-expressing diencephalic neuronal population that constitutes the dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT). Although studies in the neonatal murine spinal cord in vitro suggest an early locomotor role of the DDT, the function of the DDT in developing vertebrates in vivo remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the DDT in the locomotor development of zebrafish larvae. To assess the development of the behavioral and neural locomotor pattern, we used high-throughput video tracking in combination with peripheral nerve recordings. We found a behavioral and neural correspondence in the developmental switch from an immature to mature locomotor pattern. Blocking endogenous dopamine receptor 4 (D4R) signaling in vivo either before or after the developmental switch prevented or reversed the switch, respectively. Spinal transections of post-switch larvae reestablished the immature locomotor pattern, which was rescued to a mature-like pattern via spinal D4R agonism. Selective chemogenetic ablation of otp b (otpb) neurons that contribute to the DDT perpetuated the immature locomotor pattern in vivo. This phenotype was recapitulated by diencephalic transections that removed the dopaminergic otpb population and was rescued to a mature-like locomotor pattern by D4R agonism. We conclude that the dopaminergic otpb population, via the DDT, is responsible for spinal D4R signaling to mediate the developmental switch to the mature locomotor pattern of zebrafish. These results, integrated with the mammalian literature, suggest that the DDT represents an evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory system that is necessary for normal vertebrate locomotor development.

TI  - Androgenic activation, impairment of the monoaminergic system and altered behavior in zebrafish larvae exposed to environmental concentrations of fenitrothion
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Fenitrothion is an organophosphorus insecticide usually found in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations in the range of low ng/L. In this manuscript we show that 24 h exposure to environmental concentrations of fenitrothion, from ng/L to low mu g/L, altered basal locomotor activity, visual-motor response and acoustic/vibrational escape response of zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, fenitrothion and expression of gap43a, gfap, atp2b1a, and mbp exhibited a significant non-monotonic concentration-response relationship. Once determined that environmental concentrations of fenitrothion were neurotoxic for zebrafish larvae, a computational analysis identified potential protein targets of this compound. Some of the predictions, including interactions with acetylcholinesterase, monoamine-oxidases and androgen receptor (AR), were experimentally validated. Binding to AR was the most suitable candidate for molecular initiating event, as indicated by both the up-regulation of cyp19a1b and sult2st3 and the non-monotonic relationship found between fenitrothion and the observed responses. Finally, when the integrity of the monoaminergic system was evaluated, altered levels of L-DOPA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA were found, as well as a significant up-regulation of slc18a2 expression at the lowest concentrations of fenitrothion. These data strongly suggest that concentrations of fenitrothion commonly found in aquatic ecosystems present a significant environmental risk for fish communities. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Bioconcentration and effects of hexabromocyclododecane exposure in crucian carp (Carassius auratus)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - As a cycloaliphatic brominated flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) has been widely used in building thermal insulation and fireproof materials. However, there is little information on the bioconcentration as well as effects with respect to HBCD exposure in the aquatic environment. To investigate the bioconcentration of HBCD in tissues (muscle and liver) and its biochemical and behavioural effects, juvenile crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were exposed to different concentrations of technical HBCD (nominal concentrations, 2, 20, 200 mu g/L) for 7 days, using a flow-through exposure system. HBCD was found to concentrate in the liver and muscle with a terminal concentration of 0.60 +/- 0.22 mu g/g lw (lipid weight) and 0.18 +/- 0.02 mu g/g lw, respectively, at an environmentally-relevant concentration (2 mu g/L). The total thyroxine and total triiodothyronine in the fish plasma were lowered as a result of exposure to the HBCD. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain was increased, while swimming activity was inhibited and shoaling inclination was enhanced after exposure to 200 mu g/L HBCD. Feeding rate was suppressed in the 20 and 200 mu g/L treatment groups. In summary, HBCD concentrations 10-100x higher than the current environmentally-relevant exposures induced adverse effects in the fish species tested in this study. These results suggest that increasing environmental concentrations and/or species with higher sensitivity than carp might be adversely affected by HBCD.

TI  - Chlorpyrifos disturbs hepatic metabolism associated with oxidative stress and gut microbiota dysbiosis in adult zebrafish
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is widely used in agriculture and is considered one of the most toxic pesticides to fish. In this study, adult male zebrafish were exposed to CPF at concentrations of 30, 100 and 300 mu g/L for 21 days. It was observed that CPF not only induced oxidative stress but also caused gut microbiota dysbiosis in the gut. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased, and the glutathione (GSH) contents decreased in the gut of the CPF-treated group. For the gut microbiota, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria showed a significant change after CPF exposure. At the genus level, approximately 25 types of bacteria in the gut changed significantly. In addition, based on a gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, we found that 98 metabolites significantly influenced the zebrafish liver, and these changed metabolites were tightly related to several pathways, including glucose and lipid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of some genes related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism decreased significantly in the livers of CPF-treated zebrafish. These results indicated that CPF exposure could induce hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in adult zebrafish. Taken together, our results suggest that CPF exposure causes hepatic lipid metabolism disorders that are associated with gut oxidative stress and microbiota dysbiosis in adult zebrafish.

TI  - Freshwater Planarians as an Alternative Animal Model for Neurotoxicology
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Traditional toxicology testing has relied on low-throughput, expensive mammalian studies; however, timely testing of the large number of environmental toxicants requires new in vitro and in vivo platforms for inexpensive medium- to high-throughput screening. Herein, we describe the suitability of the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a new animal model for the study of developmental neurotoxicology. As these asexual animals reproduce by binary fission, followed by regeneration of missing body structures within approximately 1 week, development and regeneration occur through similar processes allowing us to induce neurodevelopment “at will” through amputation. This short time scale and the comparable sizes of full and regenerating animals enable parallel experiments in adults and developing worms to determine development-specific aspects of toxicity. Because the planarian brain, despite its simplicity, is structurally and molecularly similar to the mammalian brain, we are able to ascertain neurodevelopmental toxicity that is relevant to humans. As a proof of concept, we developed a 5-step semiautomatic screening platform to characterize the toxicity of 9 known neurotoxicants (consisting of common solvents, pesticides, and detergents) and a neutral agent, glucose, and quantified effects on viability, stimulated and unstimulated behavior, regeneration, and brain structure. Comparisons of our findings with other alternative toxicology animal models, such as zebrafish larvae and nematodes, demonstrated that planarians are comparably sensitive to the tested chemicals. In addition, we found that certain compounds induced adverse effects specifically in developing animals. We thus conclude that planarians offer new complementary opportunities for developmental neurotoxicology animal models.

TI  - Alteration in sperm release from zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) exposed to DDT
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH SCIENCE
AB  - This study describes a long-term toxicity test within a period of 2 months using zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) as the test species and concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mug/l DDT as a model substance. By collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously. Sperm is released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface, subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consists of bands of viscous material in which sperm is embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180 min after 24 hr, 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reduction in count, activity of sperm and the average life span of sperm trails were significant (p < 0.05) at the tested concentrations 5 mug/l and 50 mug/l DDT after 1 month of exposure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that long exposure time and higher DDT tested levels accelerate the occurrence of negative effect on the number and activity of sperm released as well as the life span of their trails.

TI  - Stage-dependent effects of chlorpyrifos on medaka (Oryzias latipes) swimming behavior using a miniaturized swim flume
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - By considering chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphorus pesticide with known mechanisms of action that affect neurobehavioral development, we assessed the validity and sensitivity of a miniaturized swim flume by investigating the effects of the insecticide on swimming behavior in medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish growing stages. Medaka in three developmental periods, namely 0, 20 and 40 day-old post-hatch (i.e. time points 0, 20 and 40, respectively), were exposed to CPF (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mu g/L) for 48 h under semi-static conditions. The CPF half-lives during exposures were evaluated and the swimming patterns in a flume section (arena) were presented on two-dimensional gradient maps of forced movement of fish against water current. A comparative numerical analysis of fish residence times between each time point control and the corresponding CPF groups was performed by dividing arenas into 15 proportional areas. The time point 0 control group gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas. The control group gradient maps for time points 20 and 40 differed from those of the respective >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups. The comparative analysis of the residence times in the corresponding 15 areas revealed differences in >= 5 areas for time point 20 and in >= 3 areas for time point 40. The integrative analysis of the gradient maps and the numerical statistics revealed stage-specific effects and a concentration-response relationship between CPF and alterations on forced medaka swimming despite the dissipation of CPF from the water column. These results indicate the validity of the miniaturized swim flume toward a more environmentally realistic scenario for the evaluation of neurodevelopmental and behavioral toxicity in small fish models.

TI  - Toxicological assessment of seven unregulated drinking water Disinfection By-products (DBPs) using the zebrafish embryo bioassay
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Disinfection By-products (DBPs) are formed during the chemical treatment of water for human consumption, by the reaction of raw water with chemical agents used in the different steps of the process. Disinfection is one of the most important steps, inactivating pathogens and preventing their regrowth during water distribution. However, it is also involved in DBPs formation due to the use of disinfectant agents, such as chlorine, which reacts with dissolved precursors, such as pharmaceuticals, toxins, pesticides, among others. Given their widespread occurrence, potential human health and (eco) toxicological impacts are of particular interest due to their potential carcinogenicity and various non-carcinogenic effects, such as endocrine disruption. In this study, the developmental toxicity of chemically- different unregulated DBPs was evaluated using zebrafish embryo bioassay. Embryos were exposed to different concentrations of the target DBPs and multiple endpoints, including, mortality, morphological abnormalities and locomotor behavior were assessed at specific developmental stages (24. 48, 72 and 96 hpf). The different families of DBPs tested included nitrosamines, aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. The results show that the effects were compound dependent, with EC10 values varying between 0.04 mg/L (2-ethyl-1-hexanal) to 9.2 mg/L (hexachloroacetone). Globally, several of the tested unregulated DBPs displayed higher toxicity when compared with the available data for some already regulated, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which highlights the importance of screening the toxicity of still untested and poorly characterized DBPs.

TI  - Hyperactivity and Seizure Induced by Tricresyl Phosphate Are Isomer Specific and Not Linked to Phenyl Valerate-Neuropathy Target Esterase Activity Inhibition in Zebrafish
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Environmental exposure to tricresyl phosphate (TCP) may lead to severe neurotoxic effects, including organophosphate (OP)-induced delayed neuropathy. TCP has three symmetric isomers, distinguished by the methyl group position on the aromatic ring system. One of these isomers, tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCP), has been reported for years as a neuropathic OP, targeting neuropathic target esterase (NTE/PNPLA6), but its mode of toxic action had not been fully elucidated. Zebrafish eleuthero-embryo and larva were used to characterize the differential action of the TCP isomers. The symmetric isomers inhibited phenyl valerate (PV)-NTE enzymatic activity in vivo with different IC50, while no effect was observed on acetylcholinesterase activity. Moreover, the locomotor behavior was also affected by tri-para-cresyl phosphate and tri-meta-cresyl phosphate, only ToCP exposure led to locomotor hyperactivity lasting several hours, associated with defects in the postural control system and an impaired phototactic response, as revealed by the visual motor response test. The electric field pulse motor response test demonstrated that a seizure-like, multiple C-bend-spaghetti phenotype may be significantly induced by ToCP only, independently of any inhibition of PV-NTE activity. Eleuthero-embryos exposed to picrotoxin, a known gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor inhibitor, exhibited similar adverse outcomes to ToCP exposure. Thus, our results demonstrated that the TCP mode of toxic action was isomer specific and not initially related to modulation of PV-NTE activity. Furthermore, it was suggested that the molecular events involved were linked to an impairment of the balance between excitation and inhibition in neuronal circuits.

TI  - A short-term sublethal toxicity assay with zebra fish based on preying rate and its integration with mortality
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Contaminant-induced feeding inhibition has direct and immediate consequences at higher levels of biological organization, by depressing the population consumption and thus hampering ecosystem functioning (e.g. grazing, organic matter decomposition). Thus, similarly to lethality and avoidance, feeding is mechanistically linked to ecosystem processes and is therefore an unequivocal ecologically meaningful response. The objective of the present study was to develop a short-term assay with the small freshwater fish Danio rerio, based on feeding. For this, a methodology to easily and precisely quantify feeding was first optimized: each fish was allowed to prey on ten live Daphnia magna juveniles, for 1 h, just before the end of a 48-h exposure test period. Secondly, copper sensitivity of feeding relatively to survival and growth was evaluated. At the growth EC20 (40 mu g L-1), feeding was inhibited by 53%, and at the feeding EC50 (36 mu g L-1), mortality was negligible (1.3%). Integrating feeding and survival revealed a 97% depression in the population consumption at the LC50 (61 mu g L-1). Thirdly, the influence of pH, conductivity and hardness on the feeding background variability was assessed by assaying waters collected at eight reference sites and was found to be negligible, within tested ranges. Fourthly, feeding assays with natural waters contaminated with acid mine drainage confirmed the integration of lethality and feeding to be pertinent at estimating contaminant effects at higher levels of biological organization.

TI  - Ecological and toxicological assessments of anthropogenic contaminants based on environmental metabolomics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ECOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - There has long been a great concern with growing anthropogenic contaminants and their ecological and toxicological effects on living organisms and the surrounding environment for decades. Metabolomics, a functional readout of cellular activity, can capture organismal responses to various contaminant-related stressors, acquiring direct signatures to illustrate the environmental behaviours of anthropogenic contaminants better. This review entails the application of metabolomics to profile metabolic responses of environmental organisms, e.g. animals (rodents, fish, crustacean and earthworms) and microorganisms (bacteria, yeast and microalgae) to different anthropogenic contaminants, including heavy metals, nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal products, persistent organic pollutants, and assesses their ecotoxicological impacts with regard to literature published in the recent five years. Contaminant-induced metabolism alteration and up/down-regulation of metabolic pathways are revealed in typical organisms. The obtained insights of variations in global metabolism provide a distinct understanding of how anthropogenic contaminants exert influences on specific metabolic pathways on living organisms. Thus with a novel ecotechnique of environmental metabolomics, risk assessments of anthropogenic contaminants are profoundly demonstrated. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Exposure to the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid impairs mitochondrial function, oxidative status, and behavior in adult zebrafish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is one of the most commonly used herbicides worldwide. While the effects of 2,4-D in target organisms are well known, its consequences in nontarget organisms are not fully explained. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the herbicide on mitochondrial energy metabolism, oxidative status, and exploratory behavior in adult zebrafish. Animal exposure to 2,4-D increased cytochrome c oxidase and catalase activities and reduced SOD/CAT ratio, moreover, increased the total distance traveled and the number of crossings. Finally, animals exposed to 2,4-D spent more time in the upper zone of the tank and traveled a long distance in the upper zone. Overall, our results indicate the 2,4-D can provoke disabling effects in nontarget organisms. The obtained data showed that exposure to 2,4-D at environmentally relevant concentrations alters mitochondrial metabolism and antioxidant status and disturbs the zebrafish innate behavior.

TI  - Toxic effects of a mancozeb-containing commercial formulation at environmental relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryonic development
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The toxicological knowledge of mancozeb (MZ)-containing commercial formulations on non-target species is scarce and limited. Therefore, the objective of this work was to represent a realistic application scenario by evaluating the toxicity of environmental relevant and higher concentrations of a commercial formulation of MZ using zebrafish embryos. Following determination of the 96-h LC50 value, the embryos at the blastula stage (similar to 2 h post-fertilisation, hpf) were exposed to 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g L-1 of the active ingredient (similar to 40x lower than the 96-h LC50). During the exposure period (96 h), lethal, sublethal, and teratogenic parameters, as well as behaviour analysis, at 120 hpf, were assayed. Biochemical parameters such as oxidative stress-linked enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and glutathione levels (GSH and GSSG), as well as the activity of degradation (glutathione S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE)), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), and anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related enzymes, were analysed at the end of the exposure period. Exposed embryos showed a marked decrease in the hatching rate and many malformations (cardiac and yolk sac oedema and spinal torsions), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration. A dose-dependent decreased locomotor activity and a response to an aversive stimulus, as well as a light-dark transition decline, were observed at environmental relevant concentrations. Furthermore, the activities of SOD and GR increased while the activity of GST, AChE, and MDA contents decreased. Taken together, the involvement of mancozeb metabolites and the generation of ROS are suggested as responsible for the developmental phenotypes. While further studies are needed to fully support the hypothesis presented, the potential cumulative effects of mancozeb-containing formulations and its metabolites could represent an environmental risk which should not be disregarded.

TI  - alpha-Synuclein amplifies cytoplasmic peroxide flux and oxidative stress provoked by mitochondrial inhibitors in CNS dopaminergic neurons in vivo
T2  - REDOX BIOLOGY
AB  - Convergent evidence implicates impaired mitochondrial function and alpha-Synuclein accumulation as critical upstream events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, but comparatively little is known about how these factors interact to provoke neurodegeneration. We previously showed that alpha-Synuclein knockdown protected rat substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons from systemic exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone. Here we show that motor abnormalities prior to neuronal loss in this model are associated with extensive alpha-Synuclein-dependent cellular thiol oxidation. In order to elucidate the underlying events in vivo we constructed novel transgenic zebrafish that co-express, in dopaminergic neurons: (i) human alpha-Synuclein at levels insufficient to provoke neurodegeneration or neurobehavioral abnormalities; and (ii) genetically-encoded ratiometric fluorescent biosensors to detect cytoplasmic peroxide flux and glutathione oxidation. Live intravital imaging of the intact zebrafish CNS at cellular resolution showed unequivocally that alpha-Synuclein amplified dynamic cytoplasmic peroxide flux in dopaminergic neurons following exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitors MPP + or rotenone. This effect was robust and clearly evident following either acute or prolonged exposure to each inhibitor. In addition, disturbance of the resting glutathione redox potential following exogenous hydrogen peroxide challenge was augmented by alpha-Synuclein. Together these data show that alpha-Synuclein is a critical determinant of the redox consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. The findings are important because the mechanisms underlying alpha-Synuclein-dependent reactive oxygen species fluxes and antioxidant suppression might provide a pharmacological target in Parkinson's disease to prevent progression from mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress to cell death.

TI  - Subchronic impacts of 2,4-D herbicide Weedestroy (R) AM40 on associative learning in juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens)
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control a wide variety of invasive and nuisance plants. One common active ingredient used in commercial herbicide formulations in Midwestern states is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Due to the stability of 2,4-D in aquatic environments, many non-target aquatic species experience prolonged exposure throughout critical developmental life stages that can affect essential behaviors. However, the impacts of 2,4-D exposure on learning behaviors in juvenile fish are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments using a maze environment to determine the effects of a commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide formulation (Weedestroy (R) AM40; WAM40; at 0.00, 0.50, 2.00, and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D acid equivalent (a.e.)) exposure on juvenile yellow perch's ability to perform a feed associated learning behavior. We observed a significant decrease in the ability of yellow perch to correctly complete the feed associated learning behavior within 200 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to controls (p = 0.0002; p < 0.0001, respectively) and within 600 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.0 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to the controls (p = 0.0107 and p 0.0001). These data suggest that exposure to 2,4-D in WAM40 can both increase the amount of time it takes for yellow perch to complete a feed associated learning behavior and/or obstruct the behavior altogether. Further experiments showed no significant decreases in locomotion (p 0.05), hunger motivation (p > 0.05), and a visually guided startle response (p > 0.05), in all treatment groups tested as compared to controls. This suggests that 2,4-D in WAM40 does not inhibit feed associated learning behaviors via interaction with these mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to cognitive functions that control essential behaviors of yellow perch.

TI  - Assessment of trifloxystrobin uptake kinetics, developmental toxicity and mRNA expression in rare minnow embryos
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Trifloxystrobin (TFS) is the widely used strobilurin fungicide. However, little information is so far available regarding the uptake kinetics and developmental toxicity of TFS to fish. The present study was conducted to investigate the uptake kinetics, potential environment risk and toxicity of TFS on Gobiocypris rarus embryos. Results revealed that increased malformation, decreased body length and heart rate, affected spontaneous movement and swimming speed provide a gradual concentration-dependent manner; values of 144 h LC50 (median lethal concentration) and EC50 (median effective concentration) were 1.11 and 0.86 mu g L-1. Continuous exposure to TFS resulted in a steady accumulation with no evidence of elimination. Enzyme activities were significantly changed; reactive oxygen species and DNA damage were significantly induced after TFS treatment. Certain genes related to cell apoptosis (p53), metabolism (cyp1a), stress response (hsp70) and blood vessels (vezf1) development were all significantly up-regulated. This is the first study to define uptake kinetics and to focus on behavioral consequences, physiological changes and mRNA expression following TFS exposure in the early life stages of fish. Our results suggest that TFS is highly toxic to fish embryos. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is UV radiation changing the toxicity of compounds to zebrafish embryos?
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - At ecosystems level, environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and intensity of UV radiation (UVR) have an important role on the efficiency of organisms' physiological and behavioral performances and consequently on the capacity of response to contaminants. Insignificant alterations of these parameters may compromise this response. In addition, these parameters can additionally alter chemical compounds by inducing their degradation, producing thereafter other metabolites. Understanding the combined effects of chemicals and environmental parameters is absolutely necessary for an adequate prediction of risk in aquatic environments. According to this scenario, this work aims at studying the combined toxicity of UVR and three xenobiotics: the biocide tridosan (TCS), the metal chromium (as potassium dichromate, PD) and the fungicide prochloraz (PCZ). To achieve this goal zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (3 h post fertilization (hpf)) were exposed to several concentrations of each chemical combined with different UV intensities; mortality and eggs were recorded every 24 h for the all test duration (96 h). Results showed different response patterns depending on the toxicant, stress levels and duration of exposure. The combination of UVR and TCS indicated a dose ratio deviation where synergism was observed when UVR was the dominant stressor (day 2). The combination of UVR and PD presented a dose level dependency at day 3 indicating antagonism at low stress levels, changing with time where at day 4, a dose ratio deviation showed statistically that synergism occurred at higher PD concentrations. Finally, UVR combined with PCZ indicated a dose ratio at day 3 and dose level deviation at day 4 of exposure, suggesting a synergistic response when PCZ is the dominant stressor in the combination. The obtained results in this study highlighted the importance of taking into account the possible interaction of stressors and time of exposure to better predict environmental risk.

TI  - Effects of acetochlor on neurogenesis and behaviour in zebrafish at early developmental stages
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - The herbicide acetochlor is used in most parts of the world and is frequently detected in agricultural land and surface water; however, knowledge on the neurotoxicity of acetochlor is limited. Here, to test the effects of acetochlor on zebrafish development and behaviour, zebrafish embryos were exposed to acetochlor from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf, and larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to acetochlor for 24 h. Both were exposed to 5, 10, or 20 mg/L acetochlor. We found that acetochlor induced developmental abnormalities, locomotion variations and changes in the physiology and gene expression in the embryos and larvae. The abnormalities included spinal curvature, brain abnormalities, and the decreased formation of newborn neurons. Larval locomotion was decreased with increases in the absolute turn angle and sinuosity. Acetylcholinesterase activity reduced in both embryos and larvae, and the expression of genes that are involved in neurodevelopment and the neurotransmitter system altered. Acetochlor increased the production of ROS and the accumulation of MDA but decreased CAT activity in the embryonic brain. Additionally, acetochlor induced cell death in the brain and tail spinal cord, and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl2 and caspase 3 were significantly upregulated. Collectively, this is the first study to examine the molecular and physiological effects of acetochlor on neuronal development, and the potential mechanisms appear to be associated with oxidative stress and decreased AChE activity, which disrupt the expression of nervous system genes and apoptosis-related genes and finally lead to apoptosis and morphological malformations.

TI  - The adverse effect of TCIPP and TCEP on neurodevelopment of zebrafish embryos/larvae
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris (2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) are two widely used chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (ClOPFRs), and have been frequently detected in various environmental media. Concern is now growing whether TCIPP and TCEP can cause neurotoxicity since they have similar chemical structure with organophosphorus pesticide. Therefore, in this study, zebrafish embryos (2-120 h post-fertilization [hpf]) were exposed to TCIPP or TCEP (0, 100, 500 or 2500 mu g/L) or a model neurotoxicant, chlorpyrifos (CPF, 100 mu g/L) to investigate the adverse effects and possible mechanisms of TCIPP and TCEP on neurodevelopment. Our results showed that CPF exposure resulted in developmental toxicity including decreased hatching, survival rates and increased malformation rates (e.g., spinal curvature) as well as behavior changes such as decreased locomotive activity in dark stimulation. In contrast, TCIPP and TCEP showed no significant effects on developmental parameters, but caused similar effects on locomotive activity at high concentration, indicating that although not as potent as CPF. TCIPP and TCEP may still cause adverse effects on neurodevelopment. Furthermore, our results suggest that TCIPP and TCEP showed no effects on acetylcholine content or AChE activity, which were considered as the main targets of CPF. However, TCIPP and TCEP exposure can significantly down regulate the expression of selected genes and proteins related to neurodevelopment (e.g., mbp, syn2a, and alpha 1-tubulin) similar as CPF did. Besides that, TCIPP and TCEP can also affect the transcription of shha and gap43, which were not affected by CPF, pointing out a complex mechanism underlying TCIPP and TCEP's neurodevelopmental toxicity. Overall, our results demonstrated that TCEP and TCIPP may have adverse effect on the neurodevelopment of zebrafish embryos/larvae, but the underlying mechanism is not via the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity.

TI  - Deciphering the mode of action of pollutants impairing the fish larvae escape response with the vibrational startle response assay
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The escape response evoked by vibrational stimuli and its habituation, essential behaviors for fish larvae survival, can be altered by neurotoxic environmental pollutants commonly found in our aquatic ecosystems. In this study we have analyzed the suitability of the Vibrational Startle Response Assay (VSRA) to obtain mechanistic information about the mode of action (MoA) of the chemicals impairing the escape response and its habituation. As a proof of concept, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the action of two common neurotoxic pesticides, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) and imidacloprid, over their effects on arousal and habituation of the escape response were studied by using pharmacological antagonists of the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, mecamylamine (MCA) and scopolamine, respectively. Furthermore, potential changes in the neurotransmitter profile were analyzed. Results revealed that whereas the effect of CPO on arousal was mainly mediated by the activation of nAChRs, its effect on habituation was mainly mediated by mAChRs. On the other hand, imidacloprid only affected larvae arousal which was found to be mediated by a cholinergic independent mechanism. No association between behavioral effects on arousal or habituation in affected larvae was found with their corresponding neurotransmitter profile. These results confirm the suitability of VSRA to provide mechanistic information about the potential MoA of neuroactive compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All lights reserved.

TI  - Environmental levels of carbaryl impair zebrafish larvae behaviour: The potential role of ADRA2B and HTR2B
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The insecticide carbaryl is commonly found in indirectly exposed freshwater ecosystems at low concentrations considered safe for fish communities. In this study, we showed that after only 24 h of exposure to environmental concentrations of carbaryl (0.066-660 ng/L), zebrafish larvae exhibit impairments in essential behaviours. Interestingly, the observed behavioural effects induced by carbaryl were acetylcholinesterase-independent. To elucidate the molecular initiating event that resulted in the observed behavioural effects, in silico predictions were followed by in vitro validation. We identified two target proteins that potentially interacted with carbaryl, the alpha 2B adrenoceptor (ADRA2B) and the serotonin 2B receptor (HTR2B). Using a pharmacological approach, we then tested the hypothesis that carbaryl had antagonistic interactions with both receptors. Similar to yohimbine and SB204741, which are prototypic antagonists of ADRA2B and HTR2B, respectively, carbaryl increased the heart rate of zebrafish larvae. When we compared the behavioural effects of a 24-h exposure to these pharmacological antagonists with those of carbaryl, a high degree of similarity was found. These results strongly suggest that antagonism of both ADRA2B and HTR2B is the molecular initiating event that leads to adverse outcomes in zebrafish larvae that have undergone 24 h of exposure to environmentally relevant levels of carbaryl.

TI  - Effects of three surfactants on the degradation and environmental risk of metolachlor in aquatic environment
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Surfactants and pesticides can be simultaneously detected in the environment by the reason of their widespread use and large amounts of emissions. Due to the special amphipathicity of surfactants, it may have special effects on the environmental behaviors and toxic effects of other substances in the environment. There are few relevant studies at present. In this study, the effects of three surfactants on the degradation of the amide pesticide metolachlor in water-sediment system were investigated. The study found that the three surfactants had no significant effect on the degradation of metolachlor in the system at environmental concentrations. However, at critical micelle concentration, cationic surfactant octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and nonionic surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ether promoted the degradation of metolachlor in water-sediment system. Anionic surfactant odium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) prolonged the degradation half-life of metolachlor. The presence of surfactants not only affected the environmental behavior of pesticides. When they coexisted with pesticides, the joint toxicity to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored. This study found that the combined effects of three surfactants and metolachlor on the acute developmental toxicity of zebrafish embryos were all synergistic effects. The combined effects of two ionic surfactants and metolachlor on the acute toxicity of adult zebrafish were synergistic effects. Further study showed that co-exposure of SDBS and metolachlor increased the absorption of metolachlor by zebrafish. Combined exposure of SDBS and metolachlor caused oxidative stress in brain, gill and liver of zebrafish. The results showed that the simultaneous presence of anionic surfactants and pesticides in the environment may increase the environmental risk of pesticides.

T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of atrazine exposure (5, 15, 20, and 30 mg .L-1) on common carp and the ability of regeneration. During 96 h exposure we observed abnormal behavior in fish exposed to 20 and 30mg .L-1. Mortality and histological alterations were noticed only in the group exposed to 30mg .L-1. Most experimental groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of haemoglobin, haematocrit, leukocyte, and lymphocyte and significantly higher values of monocytes, segmented and band neutrophile granulocytes, and also metamyelocytes and myelocytes. A significantly lower (P < 0.05) leukocyte count was also recorded in experimental groups (5 and 15 mg.L-1) after recovery period. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) alterations in glucose, total protein, lactate, phosphorus, calcium, and biopterin as well as in activities of ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH were found in most experimental groups. These changes were most apparent in the groups exposed to 20 and 30mg .L-1. Most of the indices were found to be restored after the 7-day recovery period with the exception of LDH, ALT, and lactate in the group exposed to 15mg .L-1. Our results showed that atrazine exposure had a profound negative influence on selected indices and also on histological changes of common carp.

TI  - Embryonic zebrafish response to a commercial formulation of azoxystrobin at environmental concentrations
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Azoxystrobin is a broad-spectrum strobilurin fungicide for use on a wide range of crops available to end-users as formulated products. Due to its extensive application, it has been detected in aquatic ecosystems, raising concerns about its environmental impact, which is still poorly explored. The objective of this work was to study the effects of a commercial formulation of azoxystrobin in the zebrafish embryo model. Sublethal and lethal effects were monitored during the exposure period from 2 h post fertilisation (hpf) to 96 hpf after exposure to azoxystrobin concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1). The responses of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)) as well as detoxifying enzymes (glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE)) were evaluated at 96 hpf. Similarly, glutathione levels (reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG) glutathione), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) and anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related enzymes were assayed. At 120 hpf, larvae from each group were used for behaviour analysis. Results from this study showed concentration dependent teratogenic effects, particularly by increasing the number of malformations (yolk and eye), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration. However, it was found that the lowest concentration induced a high generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased activity of SOD, GST, and CarE. In addition, GR and GSSG levels were decreased by the lowest concentration, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative stress, which is also supported by the increased AChE activity and absence of behavioural changes. These findings advance the knowledge of the azoxystrobin developmental and environmental impacts, which may impose ecotoxicological risks to non-target species.

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - The measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) provides a comprehensive understanding of mitochondria] metabolism. However, no study has been conducted to investigate the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). The objectives of this study were to optimize the experimental conditions to measure OCR in zebrafish embryos using the Seahorse XFe 24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer, and to investigate the changes of OCR in zebrafish embryos exposed to OPFRs. We first optimized the experimental conditions such as the number of embryos, concentrations of inhibitors, and time points. We determined the factors, i.e., three embryos, 12.5 mu M of oligomycin, 8 mu M of carbonyl cyanaide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 24 hpf (hours post-fertilization) time point, for obtaining the typical pattern of OCR in dechorinated zebrafish embryos. After confirming the determinants upon exposure of triclosan, the inhibition of OCR was measured in zebrafish embryos exposed to two major OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP). We found that significant inhibition of OCR was observed in basal respiration for TPHP, and in basal and maxima] respiration for TDCIPP exposure, respectively. We suggest the optimum conditions of the Seahorse XFe 24 analyzer to better evaluate OCR in zebrafish embryos, and demonstrate the potential of TPHP and TDCIPP to cause the disruption of energy metabolism associated with mitochondria] dysfunction.

TI  - Evaluating the synergistic effect of Mucuna prurines extract and sesame oil against the Parkinson’s disease zebrafish model: in-vivo/in-silico approach
T2  - ALL LIFE
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused due to the degeneration of dopamine-releasing neurons. Mucuna pruriens (MP) and Sesame oil (SO) are well-known for their neuroprotective and antioxidative properties but to date, no experimental study proves their synergistic effects in PD. The protective and therapeutic potential of MP extract containing 40% levodopa along with SO were evaluated, individually and together, on a multi-low dose (0.006 mg/g) of a rotenone-induced zebrafish model of PD. Neuroprotective roles of MP extract and SO on the activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as Catalase, GST, AChE, BChE, adenosine deaminase, and content of Glutathione and Malondialdehyde were examined. Also, the dopamine, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels were estimated via the ELISA method. Histopathological studies were performed for the confirmation of neuronal damage. Swiss Target Prediction software was used to predict the target protein receptors for MP and SO and protein interaction networks were used to decipher their role in molecular pathways such as synaptic plasticity, dopamine synthesis, etc. through Cytoscape and bingo plugin. The combination of MP extract and SO was observed to ameliorate oxidative stress and significantly increase the cholinergic enzyme activity and dopamine level and thereby helps in preventing neuronal cell damage. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Reproductive Toxicity of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) on Javanese Medaka (Oryzias javanicus, Bleeker 1854)
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Compound 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a degradation product of some herbicide and intermediate industrial chemicals of many products. Unregulated use of 3,4-DCA affects the reproduction of non-target organisms. In this study, the potential reproductive toxicity of 3,4-DCA on Javanese medaka, a native sentinel organism distributed around aquatic ecosystems of Southern Asia, was evaluated. Low fecundity was observed in female exposed fish to 250 mu g/L of 3,4-DCA. Gonad tissue alternation and interference of gametes development were observed both in male and female exposed fish. The response pattern indicated that a low concentration of 3,4-DCA exerted endocrine disruption in Javanese medaka. This finding would provide additional data on the toxicity effect of 3,4-DCA, and it will strengthen the potential of native species in monitoring local and regional aquatic environments. Compound 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a metabolite of several urea herbicides and intermediate chemical of several industrial products. Moreover, 3,4-DCA has been frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems around the world. This aniline is more toxic than the parent chemicals, and it affects non-target organisms. This study evaluated a 21-day reproductive response of an emerging aquatic vertebrate model, Javanese medaka (Oryzias javanicus), exposed to 3,4-DCA. Fecundity and gonads histopathology were observed. The spawning rate and fertilisation reduced significantly in the highest exposed-group (250 mu g/L). Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly low in females exposed to 250 mu g/L. No substantial structural alteration of male gonads. However, oocyte development and ovarian cell structure were disrupted in 250 mu g/L exposed females. The gonadal developmental was not affected in the males; however, a significant reduction in the developmental of female gonads was observed at 250 mu g/L. These results show that 3,4-DCA interfere with the reproduction of Javanese medaka through fecundity and alteration of gonadal tissues.

TI  - PARKINSON'S DISEASE: ADVANCES IN PRECLINICAL SCREENING MODELS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES AND RESEARCH
AB  - About 1.5% of the world's population is suffering from Parkinson's disease, mostly above 55 years of age. It is identified by dopaminergic neuron loss in the striatum's Substantia nigra & dopamine loss (DA). The disease of Parkinson is the second most widespread neurodegenerative disorder. It adversely affects the motor system as the disease increases the destruction of the motor system. It is also known that it also affects almost other components of the brain, but slowly. By using these animal models, we got to know the process of PD, its etiology, its pathology, molecular mechanisms, and numerous other disorders. Experimental models are carried out using theses different agents such as reserpine, 6-hydroxydopamine, haloperidol, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine, and rotenone when used to produce particular PD characteristics. In addition, genetic models are also used to understand the processes in multicellular organisms such as drosophilia and zebrafish. Behavioral studies have been conducted mainly using these multicellular organisms.

TI  - Multiomic Analysis of Zebrafish Models of Acute Organophosphorus Poisoning With Different Severity
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Organophosphorus compounds are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used as pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents. Acute organophosphorus poisoning (acute OPP) affects 3 million people, with 300 000 deaths annually worldwide. Severe acute OPP effects include overstimulation of cholinergic neurons, seizures, status epilepticus, and finally, brain damage. In a previous study, we developed 3 different chemical models of acute OPP in zebrafish larvae. To elucidate the complex pathophysiological pathways related to acute OPP, we used integrative omics (proteomic, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) on these 3 animal models. Our results show that these stochastic, apparently disparate morphological phenotypes can result from almost linear concentration-response variations in molecular levels. Results from the multiomics analysis strongly suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress might play a central role in the pathophysiology of severe acute OPP, emphasizing the urgent need of further research on this molecular pathway. Endoplasmic reticulum stress could be an important therapeutic target to be included in the treatment of patients with severe acute OPP.

TI  - DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXICITY OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANTS IN EARLY LIFE STAGES OF JAPANESE MEDAKA (ORYZIAS LATIPES)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Because brominated flame retardants are being banned or phased out worldwide, organophosphate flame retardants have been used as alternatives on a large scale and have thus become ubiquitous environmental contaminants; this raises great concerns about their environmental health risk and toxicity. Considering that previous research has identified the nervous system as a sensitive target, Japanese medaka were used as an aquatic organism model to evaluate the developmental neurotoxicity of 4 organophosphate flame retardants: triphenyl phosphate, tri-n-butyl phosphate, tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, and tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP). The embryo toxicity test showed that organophosphate flame retardant exposure could decrease hatchability, delay time to hatching, increase the occurrence of malformations, reduce body length, and slow heart rate. Regarding locomotor behavior, exposure to the tested organophosphate flame retardants (except TCEP) for 96 h resulted in hypoactivity for medaka larvae in both the free-swimming and the dark-to-light photoperiod stimulation test. Changes of acetylcholinesterase activity and transcriptional responses of genes related to the nervous system likely provide a reasonable explanation for the neurobehavioral disruption. Overall, the present study clearly demonstrates the developmental neurotoxicity of various organophosphate flame retardants with very different potency and contribute to the determination of which organophosphate flame retardants are appropriate substitutes, as well as the consideration of whether regulations are reasonable and required.

TI  - Larvicidal, Histopathological, Antibacterial Activity of Indigenous Fungus Penicillium sp. Against Aedes aegypti L and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Its Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition and Toxicity Assessment of Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Fungal metabolites are considered to be most efficient tools to overcome the issues related to insecticide resistance and environmental pollution. The present study focus on the evaluation of the mosquito larvicidal efficacy of metabolites of seven indigenous fungal isolates (Penicillium sp. Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Rhizopus sp. Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp.) on the larvae of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus under the laboratory condition. The preliminary screening of the isolate, Penicillium sp. showed better larvicidal effect when compared to other fungi. The fungus was grown on Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) in the laboratory (at 25 degrees C) and maintained in the relative humidity (at 76 +/- 4% for 15 days). Larvicidal potency of mycelial ethyl acetate extract (MEAE) of Penicillium sp. was performed against 1st to 4th instars larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus using four different concentrations (100, 200, 300, and 500 mu g/ml) that showed better larval mortality values (mu g/ml) of LC50 = 6.554, 5.487, 6.874, 6.892, and the LC90 = 11.486, 10.366, 12.879, 13.865 for Ae. aegypti and LC50 = 7.000, 13.943, 18.129, 25.212 and the LC90 = 12.541, 23.761, 30.923, 41.696 for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Exposure of metabolite to larvae resulted in behavior changes i. e., excitation, up and down with aggressive movement, anal papillae biting behavior. Further, the larvae treated with Penicillium sp. metabolite exhibited significant reduction in the levels of acetylcholinesterase. The 4th instar mosquito larvae treated with the 500 mu g/ml mycelia extract showed severe histological damages. During the antibacterial analysis of Penicillium sp.-mycelium the maximum growth inhibition zone was recorded in Shigella dysenteriae (31.2 mm) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.1 mm) followed by others. In addition, to check the toxicity of Penicillium sp. MEAE against embryos of Zebrafish, a model system, using different concentrations of metabolites (1.0, 0.5, 0.125 mg/ml, 30, 3.0, and 0.5 mu g/ml) and life-stage parameters were observed at 124 hpf. Furthermore, the Fourier Transformed Infrared and GCMS spectrum analysis of mycelium reflected several chemical compounds. The outcome of the study clearly shows that Penicillium sp. metabolites could serve as an ideal eco-friendly, single-step and inexpensive source for the control of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae.

TI  - Evaluation of phoxim toxicity on aquatic and zebrafish intestinal microbiota by metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Phoxim is one of the main organophosphorus pesticides used in agricultural production. However, little information is known about how it affects the aquatic microbial community and the intestinal microbiota of fish. Herein, we utilized shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to reveal the aquatic eco-risk of phoxim. Seven days of phoxim exposure significantly changed the composition of aquatic microbial community, obliterated the interactions between microorganisms, and thus reduced the complexity and stability of the microbial community. During long-time exposure (i.e., 14 days), most of the ecological functions were restored due to the redundancy of the microbial community. However, phoxim exposure promoted the dissemination of elfamycin resistance gene. The zebrafish gut microbial community also recovered from a temporary ecological disorder of aquatic microbiota, but phoxim continually affected zebrafish growth and swimming behavior. Overall, our results demonstrated that phoxim exposure significantly changed the structure and function of the microbial community and displayed a negative impact on freshwater ecosystems in a short exposure time.

TI  - Chlorpyrifos-Oxon Disrupts Zebrafish Axonal Growth and Motor Behavior
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Axonal morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and perturbation of the rate or extent of axonal growth during development has been linked to neurobehavioral deficits in animal models and humans. We previously demonstrated that the organophosphorus pesticide (OP) chlorpyrifos (CPF) inhibits axonal growth in cultured neurons. In this study, we used a zebrafish model to determine whether CPF, its oxon metabolite (CPFO), or the excreted metabolite trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) alter spatiotemporal patterns of axonal growth in vivo. Static waterborne exposure to CPFO, but not CPF or TCPy, at concentrations >= 0.03 mu M from 24- to 72-h post fertilization significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase, and high-performance liquid chromatography detected significantly more TCPy in zebrafish exposed to 0.1 mu M CPFO versus 1.0 mu M CPF. These data suggest that zebrafish lack the metabolic enzymes to activate CPF during these early developmental stages. Consistent with this, CPFO, but not CPF, significantly inhibited axonal growth of sensory neurons, primary motoneurons, and secondary motoneurons at concentrations >= 0.1 mu M. Secondary motoneurons were the most sensitive to axonal growth inhibition by CPFO, which was observed at concentrations that did not cause mortality, gross developmental defects, or aberrant somatic muscle differentiation. CPFO effects on axonal growth correlated with adverse effects on touch-induced swimming behavior, suggesting the functional relevance of these structural changes. These data suggest that altered patterns of neuronal connectivity contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity of CPF and demonstrate the relevance of zebrafish as a model for studying OP developmental neurotoxicity.

TI  - Toxicity evaluation of traditional and organic yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) extracts
T2  - JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES
AB  - Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) is an important source of biologically active compounds with pharmacological potential. The aim of this study was to examine the toxicity of different extracts obtained from either traditional or organic cultivated yerba mate in vitro and in vivo. Aqueous, ethanolic and methanolic extracts were obtained from commercial samples of yerba mate and total phenolic content was determined employing Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. The aqueous extracts presented higher content of total phenols, compared to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, and also demonstrated lower cytotoxicity, which is the basis for testing were carried out only using aqueous extracts. The main phenolic acids found in traditional aqueous (TA) extract were chlorogenic, gallic and protocatechuic acids. Gallic and hydroxybenzoic acids were detected in aqueous cultivated organic (OA) extract. Pretreatment with OA extract (100 mu g/ml, 1 hr) was cytoprotective against rotenone-induced toxicity (1 mu M). For in vivo toxicity assay, zebrafish embryos were exposed to OA or TA extracts (10-160 mu g/ml) at 4 hr post fertilization. TA extract decreased embryos survival in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced the hatching rate at 40 mu g/ml, increased edema frequency at 80 mu g/ml and altered body curvature at 120 mu g/ml. Further, TA extract produced locomotor disorders at concentrations equal to or greater than 10 mu g/ml. In contrast, OA extract exhibited no apparent toxic effect on organogenesis and behavior up to 100 mu g/ml. In summary, the OA cultivated extract showed the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro, enhanced reduction in rotenone-induced toxicity, and produced less toxicity in zebrafish embryos compared to the TA extract.

TI  - Bioconcentration and Transfer of the Organophorous Flame Retardant 1,3-Dichloro-2-propyl Phosphate Causes Thyroid Endocrine Disruption and Developmental Neurotoxicity in Zebrafish Larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants are emerging environmental contaminants, although knowledge of their health risks is limited. Here, thyroid hormone homeostasis and neuronal development was studied in the progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP). Adult zebrafish were exposed to TDCPP (0, 4, 20, and 100 mu g/L) for 3 months. Increased generation of a reactive oxygen species and reduced survival rates was observed in exposed F1 larvae. We also observed a significant decrease in plasma thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels in F0 females and F1 eggs/larvae. The mRNA and protein expression of factors associated with neuronal development (e.g., alpha 1-tubulin, myelin basic protein, and synapsin ha) were significantly downregulated in exposed F1 larvae, as was the level of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, gamma amino butyric acid, and histamine. Larval locomotion was significantly decreased in exposed fish, but there was no effect on acetylcholinesterase activity. Bioconcentration of TDCPP was observed in F0 fish. TDCPP was also detected in F1 eggs following parental exposure, indicating maternal transfer of this compound. This study uniquely shows that TDCPP can be transferred to the offspring of exposed adults, causing thyroid endocrine disruption and developmental neurotoxicity.

TI  - Development of a Larval Zebrafish Model for Acute Organophosphorus Nerve Agent and Pesticide Exposure and Therapeutic Evaluation
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Organophosphorus compound exposure remains a present threat through agricultural accidents, warfare, or terrorist activity. The primary mechanism of organophosphorus toxicity is through inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, with current emergency treatment including anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and oxime reactivators. However, a need for more effective and broadly acting countermeasures remains. This study aimed to develop larval zebrafish as a high-throughput model for evaluating novel therapeutics against acute organophosphorus exposure. Larval zebrafish at six days post-fertilization were exposed to acute concentrations of seven organophosphorus compounds and treated with one of three oximes. Lethality studies indicated similar relative toxicity to that seen in the established rodent model, with chemical warfare agents proving more lethal than organophosphorus pesticides. Additionally, the organophosphorus-specific response for oxime reactivation of acetylcholinesterase was comparable to what has been previously reported. Behavioral studies measuring the visual motor response demonstrated greater efficacy for centrally acting oxime compounds than for those that are contained to the peripheral tissue. Overall, these results support the use of this larval zebrafish model as a high-throughput screening platform for evaluating novel treatments following acute organophosphorus exposure.

TI  - Chiral Fungicide Famoxadone: Stereoselective Bioactivity, Aquatic Toxicity, and Environmental Behavior in Soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - In this study, the stereoselective bioactivity, acute toxicity, and environmental fate for famoxadone enantiomers were reported for the first time. Five representative pathogens (e.g., Alternaria solani) were used to investigate enantioselective activity, and three non-target organisms (e.g., Selenastrum bibraianum) were used to evaluate acute toxicity. S-Famoxadone was 3.00-6.59 times more effective than R-famoxadone. R-Famoxadone also showed 1.80-6.40 times more toxicity than S-famoxadone toward S. bibraianum and Daphnia magna. The toxicity of R-famoxadone was 100 times more toxic than S-famoxadone toward Danio rerio. Under aerobic conditions, the half-life (t(1/2)) for famoxadone enantiomer degradation was 46.2-126 days in different soils and the enantiomeric fraction (EF) ranged from 0.435 to 0.470 after 120 days. R-Famoxadone preferentially degraded in three soils, resulting in an enrichment of S-famoxadone. Under anaerobic conditions, t(1/2) of famoxadone enantiomers was 62.4-147 days in different soils and the EF ranged from 0.489 to 0.495, indicating that famoxadone enantiomers were not enantioselective. This study will be useful for the environmental and health risk assessments for famoxadone enantiomers.

TI  - Bioconcentration, metabolism and neurotoxicity of the organophorous flame retardant 1,3-dichloro 2-propyl phosphate (TDCPP) to zebrafish
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants are ubiquitous environmental contaminants; however, knowledge is limited regarding their environmental health risks and toxicity. Here, we investigated the effects of acute and long-term exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) to the nervous system of zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos (2 h post-fertilization) were exposed to TDCPP (0-100 mu g/L) for 6 months up until sexual maturation. Concentrations of TDCPP and its metabolic product (bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, BDCPP) were measured in the tissues of 5 day post-fertilization (dpf) larvae. There was no effect on locomotion, acetylcholinesterase activity, levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, and expression of mRNAs and proteins related to central nervous system development (e.g., myelin basic protein, alpha 1-tubulin) in any exposure group. However, in adult fish, reductions of dopamine and serotonin levels were detected in the brains of females but not males. Downregulation of nervous system development genes was observed in both the male and female brain tissues. TDCPP concentrations were measured in adult fish tissues including the brain, and greater levels were detected in females. Our results showed that females are more sensitive to TDCPP stress than males in terms of TDCPP-induced neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that long-term exposure to lower concentrations of TDCPP in fish can lead to neurotoxicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The immunotoxicity and neurobehavioral toxicity of zebrafish induced by famoxadone-cymoxanil
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - As a new protective and therapeutic fungicide, studies on famoxadone-cymoxanil are rare, and its toxicity to aquatic organisms has not been reported. In the present study, zabrafish embryos were exposed to several concentrations of famoxadone-cymoxanil at 10 hpf. Then, the changes of their shape, heart rate, development and function of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative stress, apoptosis, the expression of apoptosis-related genes and immune-related genes, the locomotor behavior were observed and detected in acute toxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil. Our studies showed that, after exposure to famoxadone-cymoxanil, zebrafish embryos had decreased heart rate, shortened body length, swollen yolk sac. Secondly, the number of innate and adaptive immune cells was significantly reduced; and neutrophil migration and retention at the injury area were inhibited, indicating the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil on the zebrafish. We also found that the oxidative stress related indicators of embryos were changed significantly, and apoptosis were substantially increased. Further investigation of changes of some key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MYD88 and NF-kappa B p65 revealed that the mRNA expression of these genes was up-regulated. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL6 and IL-1 beta was also up-regulated. In addition, the activity, the total distance, time and average speed were decreased along with the increase of exposure concentration. The absolute turn angle, sinuosity and the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were also increased. These results suggested that famoxadone-cymoxanil can induce developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity and neurobehavioral toxicity in zebrafish larvae. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Lufenuron is a benzoylurea insecticide that interfere in chitin synthesis in insects. Although lufenuron is widely used in agriculture and aquaculture, rare are studies described that relates to possible toxic effects in fish. This work aimed to evaluate acute and chronic toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide (lufenuron) on biological parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui. This concerns about the use and discard of lufenuron, and indicates the requirement of environmental actions to prevent potential contamination of aquatic biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - PROTEOMICS
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common age associated neurodegenerative disease, which has been extensively studied for its etiology and phenotype. PD has been widely studied in alternate model system such as rodents towards understanding the role of neurotoxin by inducing PD. This study is aimed to understand the biomechanism of PD in zebrafish model system induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The phenotype and role of various genes and proteins for Parkinsonism were tested and evaluated in this study using behavior, molecular and proteomic approaches. Zebrafish PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine showed a significant level of decrease in the movement with erratic swimming pattern and increased freezing bouts. CHCHD2, EEF2B, LRRK2, PARK7, PARK2, POLG, SNCGB and SYNB genes were differentially regulated at the transcript level in PD zebrafish. Similarly a total of 73 proteins were recognized as differentially expressed in the nervous system of zebrafish due to Parkinsonism based on quantitative proteomics approach. Proteins such as NEFL, MUNC13-1, NAV2 and GAPVD1 were down regulated in the zebrafish brain for the PD phenotype, which were associated with the neurological pathways. This zebrafish based PD model can be used as a potential model system for screening prospective drug molecules for PD.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of chemical residues in surface and wastewater using passive sampling, chemical, biological, and fish behavioral assays
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Effluents from ten full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that discharge into the Hudson River, surface waters, and wild-caught fish samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to examine the influence of wastewater discharge on the concentrations of contaminants of emerging concern (CFCs) and their ecological impacts on fish. Analysis was based on targeted detection of 41 pharmaceuticals, and non-targeted analysis (suspect screening) of CEGs. Biological effects of treated WWTP effluents were assessed using a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) swimming behavior assay. Concentrations of residues in surface waters were determined in grab samples and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). In addition, vitellogenin peptides, used as biomarkers of endocrine disruption, were quantified using LC/MS/MS in the wild-caught fish plasma samples. Overall, 94 chemical residues were identified, including 63 pharmaceuticals, 10 industrial chemicals, and 21 pesticides. Eight targeted pharmaceuticals were detected in 100% of effluent samples with median detections of: bupropion (194 ng/L), carbamazepine (91 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (190 ng/L), citalopram (172 ng/L), desvenlafaxine (667 ng/L), iopamidol (3790 ng/L), primidone (86 ng/L), and venlafaxine (231 ng/L). Over 30 chemical residues were detected in wild-caught fish tissues. Notably, zebrafish larvae exposed to chemical extracts of effluents from 9 of 10 WWTPs, in at least one season, were significantly hyperactive. Vitellogenin expression in male or immature fish occurred 2.8 times more frequently in fish collected from the Hudson River as compared to a reference site receiving no direct effluent input. Due to the low concentrations of pharmaceuticals detected in effluents, it is likely that chemicals other than pharmaceuticals measured are responsible for the behavioral changes observed. The combined use of POCIS and non-target analysis demonstrated significant increase in the chemical coverage for CEC detection, providing a better insight on the impacts of WWTP effluents and agricultural practices on surface water quality.

TI  - Neuromodulatory effect of cinnamon oil on behavioural disturbance, CYP1A1, iNOStranscripts and neurochemical alterations induced by deltamethrin in rat brain
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of deltamethrin (DLM)on brain function and to find whether DLM-induced neurotoxicity is prevented by the treatment with cinnamon oil. Four groups of ten Wistar albino male rats each were used. Group I (control) received saline only. Group II received cinnamon oil alone at 0.5 mg/kg B.W. intraperitonally, whereas Group III received orally DLM alone at 6 mg/kg B.W. Groups IV was treated with cinnamon oil plus DLM for 21 days to induce neurotoxicity. Rat behaviour, brain acetylcholine esterase (AChE), serotonin, oxidative stress profile were assessed. Serum sampling for the assessment of corticosterone concentration was also carried out. Finally, we demonstrate the gene expression of CYP1A1 and iNOS and the histological picture of the brain. Considering the behaviour assessment, DLM administration alone caused neurobehavioral deficits manifested by anxiety-like behavior which represented in a marked decrease in the sleeping frequency and duration, and marked increase the digging frequency and a wake non-active behavior duration. Moreover, the open field result showed a significant decrease in central square entries and duration. The neurochemical analysis revealed that DLM significantly suppressed AChE activity and elevated serotonin and corticosterone concentrations. Furthermore, results revealed that the brain reduced glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were significantly altered in DLM treated rats. Neurochemical disturbances were confirmed by histopathological changes in the brain. Furthermore, DLM up-regulates the mRNA expression of brain CYP1A1 and iNOS. Co-treatment with cinnamon oil exhibited significant improvement in behavioural performance and the brain antioxidant capacities with an increase in AChE activity and diminished the concentration of serotonin, serum corticosterone and MDA. Cinnamon oil treatment resulted in down-regulation of CYP1A1 and iNOS and improve the histologically picture. In conclusion, cinnamon oil ameliorated DLM-induced neurotoxicity through preventing oxidative stress-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis of brain in rats.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In this work, biochar based hydrogel microspheres were fabricated successfully to develop pH and ion strength dual-stimuli responsively controlled-release system for hydrophilic pesticide. Herein, gentian violet (GV) was selected as model hydrophilic pesticide. Taking advantage of the cross-linking reaction, GV was incorporated into biochar and the 3D network-structured hydrogel, guaranteeing a satisfying encapsulation efficiency and sustained release of pesticide. The leaching behavior of pesticide in simulated soil column at different pHs and ion strength was in accordance with the corresponding release performance, and bulk of pesticide was retarded on the surface. In addition, the pesticide carrier had nearly no toxic effect on the cell proliferation and zebrafish embryo, displaying a good biosafety. The work provides a promising strategy with a low-cost and simple procedure that could regulate pesticide release behavior, decrease leaching loss, and improve the utilization efficiency of pesticide.

TI  - Cytotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment, DNA damage and associated mechanisms induced by tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate and tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate in A549 cells
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), two of the most widely applied phosphorus-containing flame retardants (PFRs), have been shown to have adverse effects in differ-ent organisms, but their underlying toxicity mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the toxico-logical effects of TDCPP and TBOEP on human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and their associated mechanisms were investigated at the cellular, organelle and transcriptional levels. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay results showed that TDCPP and TBOEP reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. High-content screening assays showed that both PFRs caused mitochondrial impairment at the organelle level, decreasing the mitochondrial mem-brane potential and increasing the mitochondrial mass, and leading to increased cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage that decreased the ratio of cells in S phase and increased the DNA content. In addition, oxidative stress was identified as a possible initial mechanistic process underlying PFR-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial im-pairment, as evidenced by intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide overproduction from environmentally relevant concentrations. Furthermore, p53 activation was shown to be involved in regulating DNA damage after A549 cell exposure to TDCPP and TBOEP. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that TDCPP and TBOEP triggered p53/p21-mediated cell cycle arrest pathways, indicating that these PFRs can activate p53, and promote as-sociated functional repair. However, the p53/bax-mediated apoptosis pathway was not activated following exposure to PFRs at specific concentrations. Our results showed that TDCPP and TBOEP can cause cytotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment and cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage in A549 cells, suggesting that oxidative stress is the initial molecular event by which these adverse outcomes are induced.

TI  - Persistence, period and precision of autonomous cellular oscillators from the zebrafish segmentation clock
T2  - ELIFE
AB  - In vertebrate development, the sequential and rhythmic segmentation of the body axis is regulated by a “segmentation clock”. This clock is comprised of a population of coordinated oscillating cells that together produce rhythmic gene expression patterns in the embryo. Whether individual cells autonomously maintain oscillations, or whether oscillations depend on signals from neighboring cells is unknown. Using a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for the cyclic transcription factor Her1, we recorded single tailbud cells in vitro. We demonstrate that individual cells can behave as autonomous cellular oscillators. We described the observed variability in cell behavior using a theory of generic oscillators with correlated noise. Single cells have longer periods and lower precision than the tissue, highlighting the role of collective processes in the segmentation clock. Our work reveals a population of cells from the zebrafish segmentation clock that behave as self-sustained, autonomous oscillators with distinctive noisy dynamics.

TI  - Environmentally relevant concentrations of boscalid exposure affects the neurobehavioral response of zebrafish by disrupting visual and nervous systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Boscalid is a persistent fungicide that is frequently detected in surface waters and may be neurotoxic to aquatic organisms. Herein, we evaluated the effects of environmentally relevant boscalid concentrations to zebrafish to explore its potentially neurotoxic mechanisms of effect. Behavioral responses (swimming, phototaxis, and predation), histopathology, transcriptomics, biochemical parameter analysis and gene expression of larval and adult zebrafish following boscalid treatment were assessed. We found that boscalid significantly inhibited the locomotor ability and phototactic response of larvae after an 8-d exposure, and altered the locomotor activity, predation trajectories and ability in adults after a 21-d exposure. It was noted that predation rates of zebrafish were significantly decreased by 30% and 100% after exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L boscalid, respectively. Adverse alterations in the cell differentiation of eyes and brain injury were also observed in both larvae and adults following boscalid exposure. The expression of genes related to neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, eye development, and visual function, in conjunction with RNA-Seq results, indicated that boscalid may impair visual phototransduction and nervous system processes in larval zebrafish. Conclusively, boscalid exposure may affect the neurobehavioral response of zebrafish by impairing proper visual and nervous system function.

TI  - Exposure to agricultural pesticide impairs visual lateralization in a larval coral reef fish
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Lateralization, i.e. the preferential use of one side of the body, may convey fitness benefits for organisms within rapidly-changing environments, by optimizing separate and parallel processing of different information between the two brain hemispheres. In coral reef-fishes, the movement of larvae from planktonic to reef environments (recruitment) represents a major life-history transition. This transition requires larvae to rapidly identify and respond to sensory cues to select a suitable habitat that facilitates survival and growth. This `recruitment' is critical for population persistence and resilience. In aquarium experiments, larval Acanthurus triostegus preferentially used their right-eye to investigate a variety of visual stimuli. Despite this, when held in in situ cages with predators, those larvae that previously favored their left-eye exhibited higher survival. These results support the “brain's righthemisphere” theory, which predicts that the right-eye (i.e. left-hemisphere) is used to categorize stimuli while the left-eye (i.e. right-hemisphere) is used to inspect novel items and initiate rapid behavioral-responses. While these experiments confirm that being highly lateralized is ecologically advantageous, exposure to chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often inadvertently added to coral-reef waters, impaired visual-lateralization. This suggests that chemical pollutants could impair the brain function of larval fishes during a critical life-history transition, potentially impacting recruitment success.

TI  - Zebrafish provide a sensitive model of persisting neurobehavioral effects of developmental chlorpyrifos exposure: Comparison with nicotine and pilocarpine effects and relationship to dopamine deficits
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) an organophosphate pesticide causes persisting behavioral dysfunction in rat models when exposure is during early development. In earlier work zebrafish were used as a complementary model to study mechanisms of CPF-induced neurotoxicity induced during early development. We found that developmental (first five days after fertilization) chlorpyrifos exposure significantly impaired learning in zebrafish. However, this testing was time and labor intensive. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that persisting effects of developmental chlorpyrifos could be detected with a brief automated assessment of startle response and that this behavioral index could be used to help determine the neurobehavioral mechanisms for persisting CPF effects. The swimming activity of adult zebrafish was assessed by a computerized video-tracking device after a sudden tap to the test arena. Ten consecutive trials (1/min) were run to determine startle response and its habituation. Additionally, habituation recovery trials were run at 8, 32 and 128 min after the end of the initial trial set. CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.025) greater overall startle response during the 10-trial session compared to controls (group sizes: Control N = 40, CPF N = 24). During the initial recovery period (8 min) CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.01) greater startle response compared to controls. To elucidate the contributions of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to developmental CPF-mediated effects, the effects of developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure throughout the first five days after fertilization were determined. Developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure significantly increased startle response, though nicotine (group sizes: Control N 32, 15 mM N = 12, 25 mM N = 20) was much more potent than pilocarpine (group sizes: Control N = 20,100 mu M N = 16,100 mu M N = 12). Neither was as potent as CPF for developmental exposure increasing startle response in adulthood. Lastly. developmental CPF exposure decreased dopamine and serotonin levels and increased transmitter turnover in developing zebrafish larvae (N = 4 batches of 50 embryos/treatment). Only the decline in dopamine concentrations persisted into adulthood (group sizes: Control N = 14, CPF N = 13). This study shows that a quick automated test of startle can detect persisting neurobehavioral impairments caused by developmental exposure to CPF This may be helpful in screening for persisting neurobehavioral defects from a variety of toxicants.

TI  - Studies on sensitivity of zebrafish as a model organism for Parkinson′s disease: Comparison with rat model
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACOTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Objective: To determine the utility of zebra fish as an animal model for Parkinson′s disease (PD) in comparison with rat model. Materials and Methods: MTT assay was performed on rat and zebrafish brain synaptosomal fractions using rotenone as a neurotoxic agent. Quercetin and resveratrol were used as standards to compare anti-apoptotic activity in both organisms. Catalepsy was induced in zebrafish by exposing them to haloperidol (9 μM) solution. Drug-treated groups were exposed to bromocriptine and pramipexole, 30 min prior to haloperidol exposure at the dose of 2, 5, and 10 μg/mL. Swimming speed, time spent in the bottom of the tank, and complete cataleptic time were evaluated to assess behavioral changes. In rats, catalepsy was induced using haloperidol (1.25 mg/kg i.p.). Drug-treated groups received bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg.) and pramipexole (1 mg/kg) orally. Bar test, block test, and locomotor activity were carried out to assess behavioral changes. Results: Resveratrol and quercetin showed comparable inhibition of apoptosis in rats and zebrafish. In anti-cataleptic study, bromocriptine and pramipexole-treated groups showed significant difference (P < 0.05) in behavioral parameters as compared to haloperidol control group in both the experimental organisms. Results obtained from fish model were in correlation with rat model. Conclusion: Findings of the present study revealed that zebrafish model is highly sensitive and can be used for basic screening of drugs against PD.

TI  - Assessing Combined Effects for Mixtures of Similar and Dissimilar Acting Neuroactive Substances on Zebrafish Embryo Movement
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Risk assessment of chemicals is usually conducted for individual chemicals whereas mixtures of chemicals occur in the environment. Considering that neuroactive chemicals are a group of contaminants that dominate the environment, it is then imperative to understand the combined effects of mixtures. The commonly used models to predict mixture effects, namely concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), are thought to be suitable for mixtures of similarly or dissimilarly acting components, respectively. For mixture toxicity prediction, one important challenge is to clarify whether to group neuroactive substances based on similar mechanisms of action, e.g., same molecular target or rather similar toxicological response, e.g., hyper- or hypoactivity (effect direction). We addressed this by using the spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of zebrafish embryos, which represents the earliest observable motor activity in the developing neural network, as a model to elucidate the link between the mechanism of action and toxicological response. Our objective was to answer the following two questions: (1) Can the mixture models CA or IA be used to predict combined effects for neuroactive chemical mixtures when the components share a similar mode of action (i.e., hyper- or hypoactivity) but show different mechanism of action? (2) Will a mixture of chemicals where the components show opposing effect directions result in an antagonistic combined effect? Results indicate that mixture toxicity of chemicals such as propafenone and abamectin as well as chlorpyrifos and hexaconazole that are known to show different mechanisms of action but similar effect directions were predictable using CA and IA models. This could be interpreted with the convergence of effects on the neural level leading to either a collective activation or inhibition of synapses. We also found antagonistic effects for mixtures containing substances with opposing effect direction. Finally, we discuss how the STC may be used to amend risk assessment.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of procymidone to larval zebrafish based on physiological and transcriptomic analysis
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - As a broad-spectrum with low toxicity, procymidone (PCM), is widely used in agriculture and frequently observed in aquatic system, which may cause some impacts on aquatic organisms. Here, to determine the developmental toxicity of PCM, embryonic and larval zebrafish were exposed to PCM at 0, 1, 10, 100 mu g/L in dehydrogenated natural water containing 0.01% acetone for 7 days. The results showed that high concentration of PCM could cause the pericardial edema and increase the heart rates in larval zebrafish, suggesting that PCM had developmental toxicity to zebrafish. We also observed that PCM exposure not only changed the physiological parameters including TBA, GLU and pyruvic acid, but also changed the transcriptional levels of glycolipid metabolism related genes. In addition, after transcriptomics analysis, a total of 1065 differentially expressed genes, including 456 up-regulated genes and 609 down-regulated genes, changed significantly in 100 mu g/L PCM treated larval zebrafish. Interestingly, after GO (Gene Ontology) analysis, the different expression genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched to the three different biology processes including GABA-nervous, lipid Metabolism and response to drug. We also observed that the levels of GABA receptor related genes including gabrg2, gabbr1 alpha, gabbr1 and gabra6 alpha were inhibited by PCM exposure. Interestingly, the swimming distance of larval zebrafish had the tendency to decrease after PCM exposure, indicating that the nervous system was affected by PCM. Taken together, the results confirmed that the fungicide PCM could cause developmental toxicity by influencing the lipid metabolism and GABA mediated nervous system and behavior in larval zebrafish. We believed that the results could provide an important data for the influence of PCM on aquatic animals.

TI  - Acetochlor affects zebrafish ovarian development by producing estrogen effects and inducing oxidative stress
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Acetochlor is one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide and widely distributed in the water environment. However, studies on the reproductive influence of acetochlor are still limited. To investigate the impact and potential mechanism of acetochlor on fish ovarian development, zebrafish were utilized as experiment models. The ovarian histology, ovarian development-related genes, and plasma oxidative stress-related indexes were investigated following acetochlor (at nominal concentration 1, 10, and 100 mu g/L) exposure for 7 and 21 days. Results showed that low-dose acetochlor had estrogen effect and induced zebrafish estradiol (E-2) and ovarian vitellogenin (Vtg) synthesis and promoted ovarian development, while long-term exposure to higher doses of acetochlor reduced the ability of ovarian resistance to oxidative stress and destroyed the development of the ovary. Moreover, bone morphogenetic protein 15 (bmp15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (gdf9) were also involved in the influence of acetochlor on the ovarian development of zebrafish.

TI  - Carbendazim exposure induces developmental, biochemical and behavioural disturbance in zebrafish embryos
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Carbendazim is a widely used broad spectrum benzimidazole fungicide; however, its effects to non-target aquatic organisms are poorly studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxic effects of carbendazim to zebrafish early life stages at several levels of biological organization, including developmental, biochemical and behavioural levels. The embryo assay was done following the OECD guideline 236 and using a concentration range between 1.1 and 1.8 mg/L. Lethal and developmental endpoints such as hatching, edemas, malformations, heart beat rate, body growth and delays were assessed in a 96 h exposure. A sub-teratogenic range (from 0.16 to 500 mu g/L) was then used to assess effects at biochemical and behavioural levels. Biochemical markers included cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) and were assessed at 96 h. The locomotor behaviour was assessed using an automated video tracking system at 120 h. Carbendazim (96 h-LC50 of 1.75 mg/L) elicited several developmental anomalies in zebrafish embryos with EC50 values ranging from 0.85 to 1.6 mg/L. ChE, GST and LDH activities were increased at concentrations equal or above 4 mu g/L. The locomotor assay showed to be extremely sensitive, detecting effects in time that larvae spent swimming at concentrations of 0.16 a and thus, being several orders of magnitude more sensitive that developmental parameters or lethality. These are ecological relevant concentrations and highlight the potential of behavioural endpoints as early warning signs for environmental stress. Further studies should focus on understanding how the behavioural disturbances measured in these types of studies translate into fitness impairment at the adult stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characterization of the fate and distribution of methoxyfenozide in a water-plant-fish-sediment microcosm using a multimedia fugacity model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Methoxyfenozide is widely employed in paddy land and can flow out into the aquatic environment. The present study combines two approaches, namely, an aquatic microcosm simulation experiment and a multimedia fugacity model, to study the fate and distribution of methoxyfenozide in an aquatic microcosm containing water, sediment, aquatic plants, and zebrafish. The model results indicated that the simulated concentrations agreed with the observed values within one order of magnitude. The degradation rate was less than 7.0% in the three types of aquatic microcosms at 740 h in the model. Methoxyfenozide exhibited very high persistence in the aquatic microcosm. Water played a key role in the fate of methoxyfenozide, acting as a sink in the simulated aquatic environment, followed by sediment. Only approximately 2% of methoxyfenozide entered the organisms (zebrafish and Egeria densa Planch). Methoxyfenozide underwent a significant transport process between the water and sediment. The applications of multimedia fugacity models are useful for understanding the behaviors, fate, and transport of pesticides after their release into the environment and to facilitate risk assessment and management activities.

TI  - Preparation of MSNs-Chitosan@Prochloraz Nanoparticles for Reducing Toxicity and Improving Release Properties of Prochloraz
T2  - ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB  - Nanotechnology-based pesticide formulations can improve the utilization rate of pesticides and reduce their negative effects on the environment. In this work, prochloraz was encapsulated within the pores of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) attached covalently chitosan on the surface as gatekeepers via a silane coupling agent to prepare MSNs-chitosan@prochloraz nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that the obtained nanoparticles had a relatively high loading efficiency of prochloraz (25.4% w/w) and enhanced the light stability of prochloraz effectively. The nanoparticles showed excellent esterase and pH dual-responsive properties with controlled release behavior. The biological activity survey confirmed that the acid and enzyme produced by infected fruit can easily open the “gate” guarded by chitosan to achieve esterase and pH triggered on-demand pesticide release. Compared with prochloraz emulsifiable concentrate, preharvest application of MSNs-chitosan@prochloraz possessed a longer duration and a better antifungal activity against citrus diseases. The toxicity of the nanoparticles to zebrafish was reduced more than 6-fold compared with that of prochloraz technical. These results demonstrated that the MSNs-chitosan@prochloraz nanoparticles had potential as an environmentally friendly preharvest treatment agent in agricultural application.

TI  - A versatile toxicity evaluation of ethyl carbamate (urethane) on zebrafish embryos: Morphological, physiological, histopathological, immunohistochemical, transcriptional and behavioral approaches
T2  - TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Ethyl carbamate (EC, urethane). which is used as an anesthetic especially by veterinarians due to its very long duration of action, is also a naturally occurring compound in all fermented foods and beverages. Although the health problem of EC is related to its carcinogenic potential, the scarcity of current studies that can be used in the evaluation of usage limits encouraged us to do this study. In this context, zebra fish embryos were exposed to serial doses of EC. According to the results, it was observed that CC exposure caused a significant decrease in survival and hatching rates as well as significant body malformations. Whole-mount staining results showed that CC caused dose-dependent increased apoptosis. Oxidative stress caused by EC exposure was demonstrated by whole-mount staining, transcriptional and immunohistochemically. Furthermore, it has been shown histochemically that CC exposure causes necrosis and degeneration in the brain. In behavioral tests, it was observed that CC caused hyperactivity associated with these neuronal degenerations. In addition, a dramatic decrease in blood flow was detected in association with pericardial edema. In the light of the current results, it should be carefully considered that EC can be found naturally in many human diets, especially fermented foods. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Advanced Morphological - Behavioral Test Platform Reveals Neurodevelopmental Defects in Embryonic Zebrafish Exposed to Comprehensive Suite of Halogenated and Organophosphate Flame Retardants
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The increased use of flammable plastics and electronic devices along with stricter fire safety standards has led to the heavy use of flame retardant chemicals in many consumer, commercial, and industrial products. Although flame retardant use has increased, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds their safety with some evidence showing toxicity and risk to human and environmental health. Recent efforts have focused on designing high-throughput biological platforms with nonmammalian models to evaluate and prioritize chemicals with limited hazard information. To complement these efforts, this study used a new morphological and behavioral testing platform with embryonic zebrafish to characterize the developmental toxicity of 44 halogenated and organophosphate flame retardants, including several of their known metabolites. Zebrafish were exposed to flame retardants from 6 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf) across concentrations spanning 4 orders of magnitude (eg, 6.4 nM to 64 A mu M). Flame retardant effects on survival and development were evaluated at 24 and 120 hpf, and neurobehavioral changes were measured using 2 photomotor response (PMR) assays. Compared to controls, 93% (41/44) of flame retardants studied elicited adverse effects among one or more of the bioassays and concentrations tested with the aryl phosphate ester (APE)-based mono-isopropylated triaryl phosphate and the brominated-bisphenol-A analog tetrabromobisphenol-A producing the greatest array of malformations. Hierarchical clustering showed that APE flame retardants with isopropyl, butyl, and cresyl substituents on phenyl rings clustered tightly and were particularly potent. Both PMR assays were highly predictive of morphological defects supporting their use as nonlethal means of evaluating teratogenicity that could allow for additional evaluations of long-term or delayed effects in older animals. Taken together, evidence presented here indicates that zebrafish neurodevelopment is highly sensitive to many flame retardants currently in use and can be used to understand potential vulnerabilities to human health.

TI  - Humic material changes effects of terbutylazine on behavior of zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio)

AB  - The long-term sublethal toxicity of the triazine herbicide terbutylazine (TEA; 1, 5, 50, 200 mu g/l) alone and in presence of dissolved humic material (DHM; 2 mg TOC/l) on zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) has been studied. The effect of the tested substances on behavior were investigated by recording and quantifying their spontaneous locomotor activity using the BehavioQuant(R) system. Data were analysed by the Hasse diagram technique. For the parameter light-dark-preference, but not for the parameter inconstancy of motility, a clear concentration-effect-relationship for the groups under TBA as well as for the groups under TEA + DHM exposure could be found. Comparing TEA and TEA + DHM treated groups for both test parameters the presence of DHM increased the toxic effect of TEA on zebrafish for the preference and decreased for the motility. The main result is that the preference follows an additive principle, but not the motiliy. Hints for the influence of at least two different mechanisms controlling these behavioral parameters are discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI  - Prolonged fluoride exposure alters neurotransmission and oxidative stress in the zebrafish brain
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Fluoride is an essential chemical found in dental preparations, pesticides and drinking water. Excessive fluoride exposure is related to toxicological and neurological disruption. Zebrafish are used in translational approaches to understand neurotoxicity in both biomedical and environmental areas. However, there is no complete knowledge about the cumulative effects of fluoride on neurotransmission systems. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether prolonged exposure to sodium fluoride (NaF) alters cholinergic and glutamatergic systems and oxidative stress homeostasis in the zebrafish brain. Adult zebrafish were used, divided into four experimental groups, one control group and three groups exposed to NaF at 30, 50 and 100 mg.L-1 for a period of 30 days. After NaF at 30 mg.L-1 exposure, there were significant decreases in acetylcholinesterase (29.8 %) and glutamate uptake (39.3 %). Furthermore, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species were decreased at NaF 50 mg.L-1 (32.7 %), while the group treated with NaF at 30 mg.L-1 showed an increase in dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation (41.4 %). NaF at 30 mg.L–(1) decreased both superoxide dismutase (55.3 %) and catalase activities (26.1 %). The inhibitory effect observed on cholinergic and glutamatergic signalling mechanisms could contribute to the neurodegenerative events promoted by NaF in the zebrafish brain.

TI  - Subchronic Exposure to Environmental Concentrations of Chlorpyrifos Affects Swimming Activity of Rainbow Trout Larvae
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphorous pesticide, can be found in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations of up to several hundred nanograms per liter because of water runoff from treated crops. While some studies have shown that low concentrations of CPF may have adverse effects on aquatic species, comparatively little is known about its effect on fish embryos and larvae. To investigate the developmental effects of CPF, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eyed-stage embryos were exposed in semistatic conditions to 0.3 and 3 mu g/L of CPF up to the end of the sac-fry stage, 3 weeks, at 12 degrees C. Several endpoints were analyzed including survival, hatching delay, hatching success, biometry, swimming activity, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and gene expression. At the end of the 3-week exposure, larvae exposed to the highest concentration of CPF were less mobile compared to the control and the lowest CPF conditions. No significant differences in AChE activity were observed in either set of CPF conditions compared to control, but it was significantly reduced for larvae exposed to 3 mu g/L compared to those exposed to 0.3 mu g/L of CPF. Expression of genes that encoded estrogen receptor beta was downregulated for larvae exposed to both CPF concentrations. Expression of cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 was also significantly repressed but only on larvae exposed to the highest concentration of CPF. Our results indicated that subchronic exposure to environmental concentrations of CPF could lead to sublethal effects on early-life stages of rainbow trout, especially effects on swimming activity that could affect foraging activity and escaping from predators.

T2  - CHIRALITY
AB  - The fate of tetraconazole enantiomers in strawberries during wine-making process was studied. The residues were determined by ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry after each process steps. Results indicated that there was significant enantioselective dissipation of tetraconazole enantiomers during the fermentation process. And (-)-tetraconazole degraded faster than (+)-tetraconazole. The half-lives of (-)-tetraconazole and (+)-tetraconazole were 3.12, 3.76days with washing procedure and 3.18, 4.05days without washing procedure. The processing factors of strawberry wine samples after each step were generally less than 1. In particular, the processing factors of the fermentation process were the lowest. The results could help facilitate more accurate risk assessments of tetraconazole during wine-making process.

TI  - Multi-endpoint toxicities on Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) fed with different diets
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - To compare the effects of three diets, rare minnow was fed with three diets from 30 dph to mature period. The activities of EROD, PROD, SOD and GST were measured in the WBHs as well as Vtg and TBARS concentrations at 60 dph. The rest fish were fed until adulthood for breeding studies. The group A served as the control group. It was found that Vtg, GST and EROD were significantly increased in the groups B and C, but SOD, TBARS and PROD levels were significantly increased only in the group C. In the adulthood, Vtg was significantly induced in the males in the group C. In generation F1, inhibition of CAT D activities and decrease of reproductive success were only found in pellet A group, but not in pellet B group. These findings indicate that the selection of diet is extremely important to assure veracity of the experiment results. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Promotion effect of liver tumor progression in male kras transgenic zebrafish induced by tris (1, 3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - A previous study reported that exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) could promote the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in female HCC model zebrafish. Due to the existence of gender disparity in the development of HCC between females and males, whether the promotion effect of TDCIPP still exists in male HCC model zebrafish remains unclear. In this study, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12v)), referred as kras transgenic zebrafish which was shown to be an inducible liver tumor model, was applied as experimental model to assess the promotion potential of TDCIPP for HCC in males. In brief, kras males were exposed to 20 mg/L doxycycline (DOX), 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP and a binary mixture of 20 mg/L DOX with 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, and after exposure liver size, histopathology and transcriptional profiles of liver from these treatments were examined. With the involvement of TDCIPP, the liver size was significantly increased and the lesion of hepatocyte became more aggressive. Furthermore, expressions of genes involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the solvent control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two chemicals compared to the single DOX treatment. Overall, our results suggested that TDCIPP had promotion effect on the progression of liver tumor in kras males.

TI  - Clethodim exposure induced development toxicity and behaviour alteration in early stages of zebrafish life
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, however, its potential toxic effects on organisms and the underlying toxicity mechanism are still poorly understood. In this study, zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L clethodim for up to 24 hpf, and zebrafish larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to the same density gradient for 24 h. Our results showed that clethodim could cause head and cardiovascular malformations in embryos: blurred brain ventricles, unapparent brain regions, condensation of nucleus and cytoplasm in brain cells, increased intercellular space, developmental malformations of eyes and ears, reduced neonatal neurons, disorder migration of neural ridge cells; morphological aberrations of the vascular ICM, slowing of heart beat and blood flow, reduction of circulating red blood cells, and delayed development of head and tail blood vessels. These defects could be a result of clethodim-induced oxidative stress and decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which in turn affected the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, decreased ATPase activity, and ultimately led to developmental malformations. The swimming behaviour of zebrafish larvae was observed to decrease with increasing concentration of clethodim exposure, but the angular velocity and mobility increased. These could be due to reduced AChE activity and disturbed gene expression of GABA, dopamine and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems, which thus altered the locomotor behaviour. In summary, we found that clethodim induces developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and larvae. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist diuron and its metabolites cause reproductive disorders in male marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Diuron, a widely used phenylurea herbicide, has been frequently detected in marine organism and seawater all over the world. But the understanding of potential damage of diuron on reproduction in marine fish is currently not enough. Herein, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) were continuously exposed to 0, 5, 50, 500, and 5000 ng/L diuron from embryo (0 dpf) to adult (180 dpf) stage. The results suggested that diuron had an adverse influence on male reproduction for marine medaka, including decreased gonado somatic index, histological changes of testes, decreased mobility of sperm, and reduced fecundity through disrupting the balance of sex hormone and genes expression related to hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadalliver (HPGL) axis. The reduced fecundity was reflected in abnormal sexual behaviors, further inhibited growth and development of F1 embryo and larvae. Moreover, the proportion of diuron metabolites (DCPMU and DCPU) was increased in fish, but the proportion of diuron was decreased with the increasing of exposure concentration. Diuron, DCPMU, and DCPU was identified as aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist (AhR) agonist using in silico and in vivo models. DCPMU and DCPU induced the gene expression of AhR signaling and metabolizing enzymes (such as cyp1a1) in the livers. A great deal of major metabolites affected various organs related to HPGL axis of male marine medaka and led to serious reproductive disorders. Consequently, it reveals that long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron and even AhR agonist pesticides pose a potential ecological risk for marine fish.

TI  - Interference of endocrine disrupting chemicals with aromatase CYP19 expression or activity, and consequences for reproduction of teleost fish
T2  - GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Many natural and synthetic compounds present in the environment exert a number of adverse effects on the exposed organisms, leading to endocrine disruption, for which they were termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A decrease in reproduction success is one of the most well-documented signs of endocrine disruption in fish. Estrogens are steroid hormones involved in the control of important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation, maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance of estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final step of estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the cyp19 gene, converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase CYP19 expression and function can dramatically alter the rate of estrogen production, disturbing the local and systemic levels of estrogens. In the present review, the current progress in CYP19 characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the potential of several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and activity is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both aromatase CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and regulation of the reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in diverse teleost species. Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or activity, be it upregulation or downregulation, may lead to diverse disturbances of the above mentioned processes. Prediction of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements in the promoters of teleost cyp19 genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes to affect cyp19 expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein site, an estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive elements, and elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor). Certain compounds including phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may modulate aromatase CYP19 activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown in this review, diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of aromatase cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a contaminated environment to teleost fish population.

TI  - Muscular contractions in the zebrafish embryo are necessary to reveal thiuram-induced notochord distortions
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Dithiocarbamates form a large group of chemicals that have numerous uses in agriculture and medicine. It has been reported that dithiocarbamates, including thiuram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), cause wavy distortions of the notochord in zebrafish and other fish embryos. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the toxicity of thiuram in zebrafish embryos. When embryos were exposed to thiuram (2-1000 nM: 0.48-240 mu g/L) from 3 h post fertilization (hpf) (30% epiboly) until 24 hpf (Prim-5), all embryos develop wavy notochords, disorganized somites, and have shortened yolk sac extensions. The thiurarn response was specific and did not cause growth retardation or mortality at 24 hpf. The thiuram-dependent responses showed the same concentration dependence with a waterborne EC50 values of approximately 7 nM. Morphometric measurements revealed that thiuram does not affect the rate of notochord lengthening. However, the rate of overall body lengthening was significantly reduced in thiuram-ex posed animals. Other dithiocarbamates, such as ziram, caused similar malformations to thiuram. While expression of genes involved in sornitogenesis was not affected, the levels of notochord-specific transcripts were altered after the onset of malformations. Distortion of the notochord started precisely at 18 hpf, which is concomitant with onset of spontaneous rhythmic trunk contractions. Abolishment of spontaneous contractions using tricaine, a-bungarotoxin, and a paralytic mutant sofa potato, resulted in normal notochord morphology in the presence of thiuram. These results indicate that muscle activity is necessary to reveal the underlying functional deficit and suggest that the developmental target of dithiocarbamates impairs trunk plasticity through an unknown mechanism.

TI  - Toxic effects of fluridone on early developmental stages of Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The herbicide fluridone is intensively applied to control invasive aquatic plants globally, including in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Delta (the Delta), California, USA. Our previous study revealed that the adult stage of Delta Smelt showed acute and sub-lethal adverse effects following 6 h of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of fluridone. To further investigate mechanisms of toxicity of fluridone and to assess its toxicity to early life stages of fish, we performed additional exposures using the fish model Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes). Male and female Medaka embryos were exposed to concentrations of fluridone for 14 d and showed reduced hatching success in a dose dependent manner. The half maximal effective concentration for the hatching success was 2.3 mg L-1. In addition, male and female Medaka larvae were acute exposed to fluridone for 6 h to assess their swimming behavior and gene expression patterns. Fish exposed to fluridone at 4.2 mg L-1 or higher became lethargic and showed abnormal swimming behavior. The response to the stimuli was significantly impaired by fluridone at 21 mg L-1 and above in males, and at 104 mg L-1 in females. Transcriptome analysis identified a total of 799 genes that were significantly differentially expressed, comprising 555 up-regulated and 244 down-regulated genes in males exposed to 21 mg L-1 of fluridone. The gene set enrichment analysis indicated a number of biological processes altered by fluridone. Among the genes involved in those biological processes, the expression of the genes, acetylcholinesterase, retinoic acid receptor, insulin receptor substrate, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S transferase, exhibited dose- and sex-dependent responses to fluridone. The study indicated that fluridone exposure led to detrimental toxic effects at early developmental stages of fish, by disturbing the biological processes of growth and development, and the nervous system, inducing oxidative stress and endocrine disruption.

TI  - In Silico Docking of Novel Phytoalkaloid Camalexin in the Management of Benomyl Induced Parkinson's Disease and its In Vivo Evaluation by Zebrafish Model.
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's Disease (PD) exhibits the extrapyramidal symptoms caused due to the dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra of the brain and depletion of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to enlighten the importance of the Aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme in protecting the dopamine levels in a living system. Camalexin, a potentially active compound, has been evaluated for its dopamine enhancing and aldehyde dehydrogenase protecting role in pesticide-induced Parkinson's disease. METHODS: AutoDock 4.2 software was employed to perform the docking simulations between the ligand camalexin and standard drugs Alda-1, Ropirinole with three proteins 4WJR, 3INL, 5AER. Consequently, the compound was evaluated for its in vivo neuroprotective role in the zebrafish model by attaining Institutional Animal Ethical Committee permission. The behavioral assessments and catecholamine analysis in zebrafish were performed. RESULTS: The Autodock result shows that the ligand camalexin has a lower binding energy (-3.84) that indicates a higher affinity with the proteins when compared to the standard drug of proteins (-3.42). In the zebrafish model, behavioral studies provided evidence that camalexin helps in the improvement of motor functions and cognition. The catecholamine assay has proved that there is an enhancement in dopamine levels, as well as an improvement in aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. CONCLUSION: The novel compound, camalexin, offers a protective role in Parkinson's disease model by its interaction with neurochemical proteins and also in alternative in vivo model.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) has been detected in various environmental media and has been implicated as a weak mutagen or carcinogen, but whether TDCIPP can promote the progression of liver tumor remains unclear. In this study, kras(V12) genetically modified zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12V)), a model system in which liver tumors can be induced by doxycycline (DOX), was used to evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of TDCIPP. Briefly, kras(V12) transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, 20 mg/L DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were determined. Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the binary exposure of DOX and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory response inhibitor (ketoprofen) significantly decrease the liver size and the amounts of neutrophils in the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish larvae. Collectively, our results suggested that TDCIPP could promote the liver tumor progression by induction of hepatic inflammatory responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES
AB  - This study elucidated the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos on the early life stages of banded gourami (Trichogaster fasciata). To determine the acute effects of chlorpyrifos on their survival and development, we exposedthe embryos and two-day-old larvae to six concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10 and 100 mu g L-1) of chlorpyrifos in plastic bowls. Log-logistic regression was used to calculate LC10 and LC50 values. Results showed that embryo mortality significantly increased with increasing chlorpyrifos concentrations. The 24-h LC10 and LC50 values (with 95% confidence limits) of chlorpyrifos for embryos were 0.89 (0.50-1.58) and 11.8 (9.12-15.4)mu g L-1, respectively. Hatching success decreased and mortality of larvae significantly increased with increasing concentrations of chlorpyrifos. The 24-h LC10 and LC50 values (with 95% confidence limits) of chlorpyrifos for larvae were 0.53 (0.27-1.06) and 21.7 (15.9-29.4)mu g L-1, respectively; the 48-h LC10 and LC50 for larvae were 0.04 (0.02-0.09) and 5.47 (3.77-7.94)mu g L-1, respectively. The results of this study suggest that 1 mu g L-1 of chlorpyrifos in the aquatic environment may adversely affect the development and the reproduction of banded gourami. Our study also suggests that banded gourami fish can serve as an ideal model species for evaluating developmental toxicity of environmental contaminants.

AB  - Sodium fluoride (NaF), used as pesticides and for industrial purposes are deposited in the water bodies and therefore affects its biota. Zebrafish exposed to NaF in laboratory condition showed hyperactivity and frequent surfacing activity, somersaulting and vertical swimming pattern as compared to the control group. Reactive oxygen species level was elevated and glutathione level was depleted along with increased malondialdehyde content in the brain. Levels of glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase were also elevated in the treatment groups. Expression of mRNA of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its inhibitor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) during stress condition were observed along with Gst, Cat, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1(Nqo1) and p38. Except Keap1, all other genes exhibited elevated expression. Nrf2/Keap1 proteins had similar expression pattern as their corresponding mRNA. The findings in this study might help to understand the molecular mechanism of fluoride induced neurotoxicity in fish. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neural alterations from lead exposure in zebrafish
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Lead was used extensively as a gas additive and pesticide, in paints, batteries, lead shot, pipes, canning and toy manufacturing. Although uses of lead have been restricted, lead persists in our environment especially in older homes, and generally in soil and water. Although extensive studies have determined that fetal and childhood exposures to lead have been associated with childhood and adolescent memory impairments and learning disabilities, there are limited studies investigating early neural and morphological effects that may lead to these behavioral and learning abnormalities. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of lead exposure on the brain. We treat embryos with 02 mM lead for 24,48 and 72 h and analyze neural structures through live imagery and transgenic approaches. We find structural abnormalities in the hindbrain region as well as changes in branchiomotor neuron development and altered neural vasculature. Additionally, we find areas of increased apoptosis. We conclude that lead is developmentally neurotoxic to a specific region of the brain, the hindbrain and is toxic to branchiomotor neurons residing in rhombomeres 2 through 7 of the hindbrain and hindbrain central artery vasculature.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of chiral pydiflumetofen from the perspective of reducing environmental risks
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The spatial structures of chiral pesticide enantiomers can affect their activity, toxicity and behavior, thereby altering exposure risk. Identifying enantiomer differences and developing high-efficiency green enantiopure pesticide is an important strategy for reducing the negative effects of pesticides. In this study, after confirming the absolute configuration of pydiflumetofen enantiomers, fungicidal activity evaluation indicated that the activity of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen was 81.3-421 times higher than R-(-)-pydiflumetofen on three kinds of phytopathogens that control Fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), Alternaria rot (Alternaria alternata) and Southern blight (Sclerotinia rolfsii), which might be caused by the stronger binding ability of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen with the active site of the target protein. The coexistence of R-(-)-pydiflumetofen would enhance the toxicity of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen on zebrafish through synergistic effect. Low-activity R-(-)-pydiflumetofen was preferentially dissipated in soybean, soybean plants, cabbage and celery, which was opposite in soil. The persistence of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen in crops and degradability in soil were advantageous for pesticide effects and environmental protection. Based on the maximum residue limit (MRL) and hazard quotient (HQ), the dietary risks were determined to be acceptable for all crops. Thus, developing enantiopure S-(+)pydiflumetofen products might be a high-efficiency and low-risk strategy, and more studies should be conducted in this aspect.

TI  - Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals perturbs lipid metabolism and circadian rhythms
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental chemicals can contribute to the etiology of obesity by inappropriately stimulating adipogenesis as well as perturbing lipid metabolism and energy balance. One potential mechanism by which chemical exposure can influence lipid metabolism is through disturbance of circadian rhythms, endogenously-driven cycles of roughly 24hr in length that coordinate biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes in all organisms. Here we show for the first time that exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including the pesticide tributyltin, two commercial flame retardants, and a UV-filter chemical found in sunscreens, can perturb both circadian clocks and lipid metabolism in vertebrates. Exposure of developing zebrafish to EDCs affects core clock activity and leads to a remarkable increase in lipid accumulation that is reminiscent of the effects observed for longdaysin, a known disruptor of circadian rhythms. Our data reveal a novel obesogenic mechanism of action for environmental chemicals, an observation which warrants further research. Because circadian clocks regulate a wide variety of physiological processes, identification of environmental chemicals capable of perturbing these systems may provide important insights into the development of environmentally-induced metabolic disease.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Organophosphate esters (OPEs) have been a focus in the field of environmental science due to their large volume production, wide range of applications, ubiquitous occurrence, potential bioaccumulation, and worrisome ecological and health risks. Varied physicochemical properties among OPE analogues represent an outstanding scientific challenge in studying the environmental fate of OPEs in recent years. There is an increasing number of studies focusing on the long-range transport, trophic transfer, and ecological risks of OPEs. Therefore, it is necessary to conclude the OPE pollution status on a global scale, especially in the remote areas with vulnerable and fragile ecosystems. The present review links together the source, fate, and environmental behavior of OPEs in remote areas, integrates the occurrence and profile data, summarizes their bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, and ecological risks, and finally points out the predominant pollution burden of OPEs among organic pollutants in remote areas. Given the relatively high contamination level and bioaccumulation/biomagnification behavior of OPEs, in combination with the sensitivity of endemic species in remote areas, more attention should be paid to the potential ecological risks of OPEs.

TI  - Maternal exposure to organophosphate flame retardants alters locomotor and anxiety-like behavior in male and female adult offspring
T2  - HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals found in our environment that interrupt typical endocrine function. Some flame retardants (FRs) are EDCs as shown in their interaction with steroid and nuclear receptors. Humans are consistently exposed to flame retardants as they are used in everyday items such as plastics, clothing, toys, and electronics. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers were used as the major FR until 2004, when they were replaced by organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Previous research in rodent models utilizing a commercial flame retardant mixture containing OPFRs reported alterations in anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) for rodents perinatally exposed to OPFRs. In the present study we utilize wild-type mice maternally exposed (gestational day 7 to postnatal day 14) to either an OPFR mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl), triphenyl phosphate, and tricresyl phosphate or a sesame seed oil vehicle. These mice were evaluated for anxiety-like behavior in adulthood on the open field test (OFT) and the light/dark box (LDB) as well as the EPM. Outcomes from the OFT and LDB indicate that males and females maternally exposed to OPFRs exhibit altered locomotor activity. Results of the EPM were sex-specific as we did not observe an effect in females; however, effects in males differed depending on exposure condition. Males maternally exposed to OPFRs exhibited an anxiolytic-like phenotype in contrast to their vehicle counterparts. This effect in perinatally OPFR-exposed males was not due to alterations in locomotor activity. Our research illustrates that there are sex- and exposure-dependent effects of perinatal OPFR exposure on adult locomotor and anxiety-like behaviors in a mouse model.

TI  - Applications of the SR4G Transgenic Zebrafish Line for Biomonitoring of Stress-Disrupting Compounds: A Proof-of-Concept Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Transgenic zebrafish models have been successfully used in biomonitoring and risk assessment studies of environmental pollutants, including xenoestrogens, pesticides, and heavy metals. We employed zebrafish larva (transgenic SR4G line) with a cortisol-inducible green fluorescence protein reporter (eGFP) as a model to detect stress responses upon exposure to compounds with environmental impact, including bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin (VIN), and fluoxetine (FLX). Cortisol, fluorescence signal, and mRNA levels of eGFP and 11 targeted genes were measured in a homogenized pool of zebrafish larvae, with six experimental replicates for each endpoint. Eleven targeted genes were selected according to their association with stress-axis and immediate early response class of genes. Hydrocortisone (CORT)and dexamethasone (DEX) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. All measurements were done in two unstressed and stressed condition using standardized net handling as the stressor. A significant positive linear correlation between cortisol levels and eGFP mRNA levels was observed (r> 0.9). Based on eGFP mRNA levels in unstressed and stressed larvae two predictive models were trained (Random Forest and Logistic Regression). Both these models could correctly predict the blunted stress response upon exposure to BPA, VIN, FLX and the negative control, DEX. The negative predictive value (NPV) of these models were 100%. Similar NPV was observed when the predictive models trained based on the mRNA levels of the eleven assessed genes. Measurement of whole-body fluorescence intensity signal was not significant to detect blunted stress response. Our findings support the use of SR4G transgenic larvae as an in vivo biomonitoring model to screen chemicals for their stress-disrupting potentials. This is important because there is increasing evidence that brief exposures to environmental pollutants modify the stress response and critical coping behaviors for several generations.

TI  - Physiological Effects of Neonicotinoid Insecticides on Non-Target Aquatic Animals-An Updated Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - In this paper, we review the effects of large-scale neonicotinoid contaminations in the aquatic environment on non-target aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate species. These aquatic species are the fauna widely exposed to environmental changes and chemical accumulation in bodies of water. Neonicotinoids are insecticides that target the nicotinic type acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous systems (CNS) and are considered selective neurotoxins for insects. However, studies on their physiologic impacts and interactions with non-target species are limited. In researches dedicated to exploring physiologic and toxic outcomes of neonicotinoids, studies relating to the effects on vertebrate species represent a minority case compared to invertebrate species. For aquatic species, the known effects of neonicotinoids are described in the level of organismal, behavioral, genetic and physiologic toxicities. Toxicological studies were reported based on the environment of bodies of water, temperature, salinity and several other factors. There exists a knowledge gap on the relationship between toxicity outcomes to regulatory risk valuation. It has been a general observation among studies that neonicotinoid insecticides demonstrate significant toxicity to an extensive variety of invertebrates. Comprehensive analysis of data points to a generalization that field-realistic and laboratory exposures could result in different or non-comparable results in some cases. Aquatic invertebrates perform important roles in balancing a healthy ecosystem, thus rapid screening strategies are necessary to verify physiologic and toxicological impacts. So far, much of the studies describing field tests on non-target species are inadequate and in many cases, obsolete. Considering the current literature, this review addresses important information gaps relating to the impacts of neonicotinoids on the environment and spring forward policies, avoiding adverse biological and ecological effects on a range of non-target aquatic species which might further impair the whole of the aquatic ecological web.

TI  - The Insecticide Synergist Piperonyl Butoxide Inhibits Hedgehog Signaling: Assessing Chemical Risks
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The spread of chemicals, including insecticides, into the environment often raises public health concerns, as exemplified by a recent epidemiologic study associating in utero piperonyl butoxide (PBO) exposure with delayed mental development. The insecticide synergist PBO is listed among the top 10 chemicals detected in indoor dust; a systematic assessment of risks from PBO exposure, as for many toxicants unfortunately, may be underdeveloped when important biological targets that can cause toxicity are unknown. Hedgehog/Smoothened signaling is critical in neurological development. This study was designed to use novel high-throughput in vitro drug screening technology to identify modulators of Hedgehog signaling in environmental chemicals to assist the assessment of their potential risks. A directed library of 1408 environmental toxicants was screened for Hedgehog/Smoothened antagonist activity using a high-content assay that evaluated the interaction between Smoothened and beta arrestin2 green fluorescent protein. PBO was identified as a Hedgehog/Smoothened antagonist capable of inhibiting Hedgehog signaling. We found that PBO bound Smoothened and blocked Smoothened overexpression induced Gli-luciferase reporter activity but had no effect on Gli-1 downstream transcriptional factor induced Gli activity. PBO inhibited Sonic Hedgehog ligand induced Gli signaling and mouse cerebellar granular precursor cell proliferation. Moreover, PBO disrupted zebrafish development. Our findings demonstrate the value of high-throughput target-based screening strategies that can successfully evaluate large numbers of environmental toxicants and identify key targets and unknown biological activity that is helpful in properly assessing potential risks.

TI  - NEW WAYS TO ECOTOXICOLOGY - QUANTITATIVE RECORDING OF BEHAVIOR OF FISH AS TOXICITY END-POINT
T2  - ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA
AB  - The BehavioQuant(R) system will be introduced which uses the integrative whole-organism response by automatized recording and quantifying the spontaneous behaviour of fish and other test organisms. While moving unrestricted within the test chamber, the movements of each single fish are recorded by video imaging, and their traces are digitized numerically by x-/y-coordinates. From the object traces several test parameters are calculated which give information about behavioural changes of the observed fishes. These various parameters are: the average swimming velocity (motility), the average swimming depth below surface, the inconstancy of motility, the frequency of turns, the standard frequency distributions of vertical and horizontal positions (can be used for quantification of a preference for dark or light habitats), and the distance behaviour. A continuously monitoring of up to 16 aquaria is possible. The statistic comparison between treated groups and control groups is done for each test parameter separately. The automatical evaluation of the continuous observation of surface waters results from a comparison of the actual behaviour data to the data of a reference period. Some examples for the applications of the BehavioQuant(R) system will be demonstrated (effects of atrazine), and their results will be discussed. Behavioural changes of a single species can finally cause changes in biocenotic structures and functions. Therefore, it is necessary to include the results of quantitative behaviour measurements in ecotoxicological hazard assessment.

TI  - The use of developmental neurotoxicity data in pesticide risk assessments
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Following the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act, which mandated an increased focus on evaluating the potential toxicity of pesticides to children, the number of guideline developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) studies (OPPTS 870.6300) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) was greatly increased. To evaluate the impact of available DNT studies on individual chemical risk assessments, the ways in which data from these studies are being used in pesticide risk assessment were investigated. In addition, the neurobehavioral and neuropathological parameters affected at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for each study were evaluated to ascertain whether some types of endpoints were consistently more sensitive than others. As of December 2008, final OPP reviews of DNT studies for 72 pesticide chemicals were available; elimination of studies with major deficiencies resulted in a total of 69 that were included in this analysis. Of those studies, 15 had been used to determine the point of departure for one or more risk assessment scenarios, and an additional 13 were determined to have the potential for use as a point of departure for future risk assessments (selection is dependent upon review of the entire database available at the time of reassessment). Analysis of parameters affected at the study LOAELs indicated that no single parameter was consistently more sensitive than another. Early assessment time points (e.g., postnatal day (PND) 11/21) tended to be more sensitive than later time points (e.g., PND 60). These results demonstrate that data generated using the current guideline DNT study protocol are useful in providing points of departure for risk assessments. The results of these studies also affirm the importance of evaluating a spectrum of behavioral and neuropathological endpoints, in both young and adult animals, to improve the detection of the potential for a chemical to cause developmental neurotoxicity.

TI  - Hippocampal proteomic analysis reveals the disturbance of synaptogenesis and neurotransmission induced by developmental exposure to organophosphate flame retardant triphenyl phosphate
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - With the spread of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), the environmental and health risks they induce are attracting attention. Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a popular alternative to brominated flame retardant and halogenated OPFRs. Neurodevelopmental toxicity is TPHP's primary adverse effect, whereas the biomarkers and the modes of action have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg of TPHP were orally administered to mice from postnatal day 10 (P10) to P70. The behavioral tests showed a compromised learning and memory capability. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus exposed to 0.5 or 50 mg/kg of TPHP identified 531 differentially expressed proteins that were mainly involved in axon guidance, synaptic function, neurotransmitter transport, exocytosis, and energy metabolism. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that exposure to TPHP reduced the protein levels of TUBB3 and SYP in the synapses of hippocampal neurons. TPHP exposure also downregulated the gene expression of neurotransmitter receptors including Grins, Htr1 alpha, and Adra1 alpha in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, the calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis governed by synaptic vesicle proteins STX1A and SYT1 was inhibited in the TPHP-treated hippocampus. Our results reveal that TPHP exposure causes abnormal learning and memory behaviors by disturbing synaptogenesis and neurotransmission.

TI  - Prioritizing phthalate esters (PAEs) using experimental in vitro/vivo toxicity assays and computational in silico approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Phthalate esters (PAEs) pose prominent ecological risks owing to their multiplex toxicity potentials and ubiquitous detection in the environment. Therefore, this study aims to prioritize the individual and mixtures of six PAEs based on their toxicological implications using in vitro and vivo models exposed at environmentally relevant concentrations. Results were further confirmed using in silico Combination index (CI) and Independent action (IA), and molecular docking models. Among PAEs, DEHP revealed prominent in vitro/vivo toxicity followed by DEP, DBP, and DMP. Importantly, binary mixtures particularly C2-C6 and C11-C15 exhibited greater developmental toxicity, apoptosis, and perturbed the HPG pathway. The CI and IA models forecasted antagonistic and additive effects at Fa = 0.5 and Fa = 0.9 using in vitro Acinetobacter sp. Tox2. Conversely, in zebrafish, the IA model predicted mixture effects in the following order: additive > synergistic > antagonistic on the regulation of the HPG pathway, which was consistent with experimental results from Acridine Orange (AO) staining and apoptosis gene expression. Molecular docking for estrogen receptors (ER alpha, ER beta) revealed the highest bindingenergy scores for DEHP, compared to other PAEs. In short, our findings confirm that individual and mixtures of PAEs behave as xenoestrogens in the freshwater ecosystem with DEHP as a priority compound.

TI  - Enantioselectivity in endocrine disrupting effects of four cypermethrin enantiomers based on in vitro models
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Cypermethrin (CP) is a kind of chiral pesticides that has been defined as endocrine disrupting chemical. The diversity in bioactivity, toxicity, metabolism, bioaccumulation, and degradation behaviors of CP enantiomers as well as the research deficiency had made the risk assessment of CP enantiomers very complicated. Herein, four CP enantiomers were separated as target chemicals to investigate their enantioselective endocrine disrupting effects. Firstly, dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were adopted to investigate their potential endocrine disrupting effects via various receptors. The expression levels of steroid hormones related genes and hormone secretion levels in H295R cell were measured to verify the results. Results from the reporter gene assay showed that 1R-cis-alpha S-CP (CP11) exhibited glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and thyroid receptor (TR) antagonistic activity with the RIC20 values of 9.22 x 10(-7), 3.33 x 10(-7), and 4.47 x 10(-7) M, respectively; 1R-trans-alpha S-CP (CP21) also showed androgen receptor (AR) agonist activity and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonistic activity with the REC20 and RIC20 values were 1.07 x 10(-4) M and 4.78 x 10(-6) M, respectively. Results of qRT-PCR and hormone measurement also showed that CP11 and CP21 could disturb the expression of steroid hormones related genes and hormone secretion accordingly. Results provided here can help to understand the enantioselective ecological and health risks of CP enantiomers comprehensively and provide constructive guidance for the safe use of chiral pesticides and the invention of green pesticides.

TI  - Study on systemic and reproductive toxicity of acetochlor in male mice
T2  - TOXICOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Acetochlor is one of the three most abundant herbicides used in China, which is a pre-emergence herbicide belonging to chloroacetanilides. It is classified as likely to be carcinogenic to humans and suspected as an endocrine disruptor by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the European Union Environmental Protection Agency (EUEPA). Therefore, there is increasing concern about the risk of acetochlor to human health and the environment. However, the current research on acetochlor mainly focuses on the assessment of environmental behaviors, whereas toxicity studies mainly concentrate on non-mammals such as zebrafish. So far, only a few reports of its effects on the male reproductive system of animals have been found. In the present study, C57BL/6 male mice and GC-1 spermatogonia(spgs) were used to analyze in vivo and in vitro toxicities of acetochlor to investigate the relationships among acetochlor-induced oxidative stress, endocrine dysfunction, degenerative diseases of germ cells and apoptosis. The results show that acetochlor can induce systemic and reproductive toxicity in subacutely exposed mice, such as clear reduction in body weight, liver function damage in mice, oxidative stress damage and histopathological degeneration in testicular tissue as the concentration of acetochlor increases. In addition, acetochlor might mediate apoptotic pathways that affect the survival of GC-1 spgs; in detail, cell viability decreases, cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis are elevated, and oxidative stress and expression changes of apoptosis-related proteins are observed compared with that for control in GC-1 spgs. In addition, this study also provides a scientific basis for evaluating the toxicological effects of acetochlor as well as its potential damage to mammals.

T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - BACKGROUND A controlled-release formulation based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) provides an effective way for reducing pesticide use and protecting the ecological environment. In this study, MSNs loaded with pyraclostrobin (PYR@MSNs) were prepared using a one-pot method. RESULTS The characteristics of PYR@MSNs were systematically investigated, including morphology, loading content, ultraviolet (UV) resistance, release behavior, control effects against pathogens, and safety to nontarget organisms. The results show that the prepared PYR@MSNs presented characteristics of regular spherical shapes, uniform particle size (200 nm), high drug loading (38.9%), and enhanced UV resistance. Compared with traditional formulation, PYR@MSNs exhibited improved control effects against Fusarium graminearum, an extended control period, and lower toxicity to zebrafish, earthworms and BEAS-2B cells. CONCLUSIONS This research will facilitate the development of efficient and safe pesticide delivery systems. The PYR@MSNs has showed its potential as a new controlled-release formulation with increased efficacy and is expected to benefit the sustainable development of agriculture.

TI  - Perinatal exposure to FireMaster® 550 (FM550), brominated or organophosphate flame retardants produces sex and compound specific effects on adult Wistar rat socioemotional behavior.
T2  - HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Firemaster 550 (FM550) is a flame retardant (FR) mixture that has become one of the most commonly used FRs in household items such as foam-based furniture and baby products. Because this mixture readily leaches from products, contamination of the environment and human tissues is widespread. Prior work by us and others has reported sex-specific behavioral deficits in rodents and zebrafish following early life exposure. In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which these behavioral effects occur, here we explored the effects of its constituents on behavioral outcomes previously shown to be altered by developmental FM550 exposure. The FM550 commercial mixture is composed of two brominated compounds (BFR) and two organophosphate compounds (OPFRs) at almost equivalent proportions. Both the BFR and the OPFR components are differentially metabolized and structurally distinct, but similar to known neurotoxicants. Here we examined adult Wistar rat offspring socioemotional behaviors following perinatal exposure (oral, to the dam) to vehicle, 2000 μg/day FM550, 1000 μg/day BFR or 1000 μg/day OPFR from gestation day 0 to weaning. Beginning on postnatal day 65 offspring from all groups were subjected to a series of behavioral tasks including open field, elevated plus maze, marble burying, social interaction tests, and running wheel. Effects were exposure-, sex- and task-specific, with BFR exposure resulting in the most consistent behavioral deficits. Overall, exposed females showed more deficits compared to males across all dose groups and tasks. These findings help elucidate how different classes of flame retardants, independently and as a mixture, contribute to sex-specific behavioral effects of exposure.

TI  - Toxic effects of oxine-copper on development and behavior in the embryo-larval stages of zebrafish
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Oxine-copper (OxCu) is generally used as an agricultural pesticide and induces harmful effects on ecosystems. In this study, zebrafish was used to assess the aquatic toxicity of OxCu. To detect the effects on development, embryos of 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 mu g/L, 20 mu g/L, 40 mu g/L OxCu for 18 h; meanwhile, to evaluate the effects on the behavior, larval fish at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to the same concentrations for 24 h. Here, we show that there are embryonic developmental defects, including abnormalities of head and trunk, brain ventricle atrophy, reduced newborn neurons, disordered neurons, increased intercellular space, concentrated cytoplasm, decreased heart beat and blood flow velocity, and developmental delay of the vascular system; in addition, some embryos exposed to the high concentration of OxCu degraded from the tail. We also found that the spontaneous tail coiling frequency and AChE enzyme activity were reduced, while oxidative stress (free radical damage) and cell apoptosis were significantly increased. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment, vascular development and apoptosis were dysregulated in the OxCu exposed embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, we found that after exposure to OxCu, larval locomotor activity was decreased and accompanied by Parkinson-like (increased absolute turn angle and sinuosity) and anxiety-like (preferred to the central area) behavior. These results indicate that OxCu induces developmental toxicity and behavioral alterations by affecting AChE enzyme activity and oxidative stress. Our data present new proofs of OxCu toxicity and a warning for its application.

TI  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate accelerated the aging process induced by the 4-hydroxynon-2-enal response to reactive oxidative species in Caenorhabditis elegans
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) has been frequently detected in environmental media and biological samples. However, knowledge of its adverse health consequences is limited. In the current study, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans, L1 larvae) were exposed to TDCPP at environmentally relevant concentrations (control, 0.1, 1, 100 and 1000 mu g L-1) for 72 h to explore any association between TDCPP and the aging process. Some of the degenerative age-related indicators were observed, including locomotion behaviors and lifespan. As crucial biomarkers of aging, the accumulation of lipofuscin, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) products exemplified by 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (4-HNE) were detected. This product forms as a result of oxidative stress, as confirmed by an N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pharmacological assay. Moreover, a significant increase in reactive oxide species (ROS) production in a dose-dependent manner using a fluorescent probe was observed. For the underlying molecular mechanism of the above aging phenotypes, significantly upregulated transcription of genes related to antioxidant systems, especially a subset of glutathione S-transferase (gst-5, gst-6, gst-9, gst-10, gst-19, gst-24, gst-26, gst-29, gst-33, and gst-38), was found by RNA-Seq and further confirmed by RT-qPCR. The elevated glutathione S-transferase (GST) was attributed to the significant increase in 4-HNE because mutations in gst-5 and gst-24 inhibited the conjugation of GSTs with 4-HNE. Therefore, GST play an indispensable role in the detoxification process of TDCPP exposure and further confirmed LPO accumulation at the molecular mechanism level. In conclusion, TDCPP accelerated the aging process induced by the LPO products, 4-HNE, response to reactive oxidative species in C. elegans. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acute exposure to triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) disturbs ocular development and muscular organization in zebrafish larvae
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) is an organophosphate flame retardant that is frequently detected in the environments. TPhP exposure is known to cause developmental toxicity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain underestimated. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were acutely exposed to 0, 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP until 144 h post-fertilization. Profiles of differentially expressed proteins were constructed using a shotgun proteomic. With the input of differential proteins, principal component analysis suggested different protein expression profiles for 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses further found that effects of TPhP at 4 mu g/L targeted phagosome and lysosome activity, while 100 mu g/L TPhP mainly affected carbohydrate metabolism, muscular contraction and phagosome. Based on proteomic data, diverse bioassays were employed to ascertain the effects of TPhP on specific proteins and pathways. At gene and protein levels, expressions of critical visual proteins were significantly changed by TPhP exposure, including retinoschisin la, opsins and crystallins, implying the impairment of ocular development and function. TPhP exposure at 100 mu g/L also altered the abundances of diverse muscular proteins and disordered the assembly of muscle fibers. Effects of TPhP on visual development and motor activity may be combined to disturb larval swimming behavior. In summary, current results provided mechanistic clues to the developmental toxicities of TPhP. Future works are inspired to broaden the toxicological knowledge of TPhP based on current proteomic results.

TI  - Cumulative effects of road de-icing salt on amphibian behavior
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Despite growing evidence of the detrimental effect of chemical substances on organisms, limited research has focused on changes in behavioral patterns, in part due to the difficulties to obtain detailed quantitative data. Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress responses in juvenile salmon exposed to waterborne levels of the organophosphate compounds tris(2-butoxyethyl)- and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphates
T2  - JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES
AB  - There is limited knowledge on the toxicological, physiological, and molecular effects attributed to organophosphate (OP) compounds currently used as flame retardants or additives in consumer products. This study investigated the effects on oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in juvenile Atlantic salmon liver and brain samples after exposure to two OP compounds, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). In this study, groups of juvenile Atlantic salmon were exposed using a semistatic experimental protocol over a 7-d period to 3 different concentrations (0.04, 0.2, or 1 mg/L) of TBOEP and TCEP. When toxicological factors such as bioaccumulation and bioconcentration, and chemical structural characteristics and behavior, including absorption to solid materials, are considered, these concentrations represent environmentally relevant concentrations. The concentrations of the contaminants were derived from levels of their environmental occurrence. The expression of genes related to oxidative stressglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST)and to lipid peroxidationperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)were determined using quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of PPAR proteins was also investigated using immunochemical methods. Levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in liver were used as a measure of lipid peroxidation. Overall, our data show an increase in lipid peroxidation, and this was associated with an augmented expression of genes from the glutathione family of responses. Interestingly, PPAR expression in liver after exposure to TBOEP and TCEP was consistently decreased compared to controls, while expression in brain did not show a similar trend. The results suggest that OP contaminants may induce oxidative stress and thus production of reactive oxygen substances (ROS), and modulate lipid peroxidation processes in organisms.

TI  - Effects of dietary exposure to ciguatoxin P-CTX-1 on the reproductive performance in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB  - Ciguatoxins are natural compounds produced by benthic dinoflagellates Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa spp., which cause fish intoxication by ciguatera fish poisoning. This study aimed to assess the dietary exposure effects of ciguatoxin P-CTX-1 on the reproductive performance in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma). Fish which ingested > 1.16 pg.day(-1) for 21 days exhibited abnormal behaviors including diarrhea, abnormal swimming, loss of appetite and decreased egg production. After 7-day exposure to P-CTX-1 at a dose of 1.93 pg.day(-1), significant gender-specific differences in reproductive performance and decreased hatching rate of the offspring were observed. Chemical analysis of P-CTX-1 showed that the P-CTX-1 accumulation rates were 24.1 +/- 1.4% in female fish and 9.9 +/- 0.4% in male fish, and 0.05 pg.egg(-1) was detected. The results illustrate that dietary exposure to P-CTX-1 affected the reproductive performance and survival of offspring, and caused bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of P-CTX-1 in marine medaka.

TI  - Using a reactive emulsifier to construct simple and convenient nanocapsules loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin to achieve efficient foliar delivery and insecticidal synergies
T2  - NANOSCALE
AB  - Nanocapsules are a promising controlled release formulation for foliar pest control. However, the complicated process and high cost limit widespread use in agriculture, so a simpler and more convenient preparation system is urgently needed. Meanwhile, under complex field conditions, the advantageous mechanism of the nanosize effect and sustained release have no quantitative and detailed study. In this study, a reactive emulsifier (OP-10) is used to participate in the interfacial polymerization of the nanoemulsion, and polymer nanocapsules loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin (NCS@LC) are quickly and easily prepared to study the efficacy and synergistic mechanism of foliar pest control. As a result, the nanocapsule is about 150 nm with a stable core-shell structure. The nanoscale state increases the distribution and adhesion of the particles on the leaf surface, which increases the contact efficiency of pesticides under the different physiological stages and behavioral activities of the target organism. The shell structure provides sustained release characteristics and increases the UV resistance by about 2.5 times for pesticides. Compared with microcapsules loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin (CS@LC), NCS@LC not only shows rapid and synergistic insecticidal efficacy but also provides sustained insecticidal efficacy. The mortality of NCS is 3.4 times that of the nanosized emulsion in water (NEW) at the lowest concentration (0.5 mg L-1), and the control efficacy remained 77.3% after 7 days. Compared with NEW, NCS@LC provides excellent field efficacy, while LC50 for zebrafish is only 0.68 times without increasing the aquatic toxicity risk.

TI  - Comparison of the behavioural effects of pharmaceuticals and pesticides on Diamesa zernyi larvae (Chironomidae)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Several studies have indicated the presence of contaminants in Alpine aquatic ecosystems. Even if measured concentrations are far below those that cause acute effects, continuous exposure to sub-lethal concentrations may have detrimental effects on the aquatic species present in these remote environments. This may lead to a cascade of indirect effects at higher levels of the ecological hierarchy (i.e., the community). To improve the determination of ecologically relevant risk endpoints, behavioural alterations in organisms due to pollutants are increasingly studied in ecotoxicology. In fact, behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes, and can be very sensitive to environmental stimuli and chemical exposure. This is the first study on behavioural alteration in a wild population of an Alpine species. In the present study, a video tracking system was standardized and subsequently used to identify contaminant-induced behavioural alterations in Diamesa zernyi larvae (Diptera, Chironomidae). Diamesa zernyi larvae, collected in an Italian Alpine stream (Rio Presena, Trentino Region), were acclimated for 24 h and successively exposed to several aquatic contaminants (pesticides: chlorpyrifos, metolachlor, boscalid, captan; pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen, furosemide, trimethoprim) at concentrations corresponding to their Lowest Observed Effect Concentration (LOEC). After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure, changes in the distance moved, the average speed, and the frequency of body bends were taken to reflect contaminant- and time-dependent effects on larval behaviour. In general, metolachlor, captan, and trimethoprim tended to reduce all the endpoints under consideration, whereas chlorpyrifos, boscalid, ibuprofen, and furosemide seemed to increase the distances moved by the larvae. This could be related to the different mechanisms of action of the investigated chemicals. Independently of the contaminant, after 72 h a general slowing down of all the behavioural activities occurred. Finally, we propose a behavioural stress indicator to compare the overall behavioural effects induced by the various contaminants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Visual system: An understudied target of aquatic toxicology
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Visual system is increasingly recognized as a sensitive target of xenobiotics in aquatic ecosystems. Various environmental pollutants of distinct physicochemical properties are able to impair the retinal development and function of teleost fishes, including dioxin-like pollutants, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl acids, retinoic acids and metals. Considering the availability of developmental and functional database, zebrafish has been the most frequently used as the teleost model to study aquatic visual toxicology. A diversity of visual deficits has been displayed for fishes across multiple levels of biological organizations (e.g., molecule, cell, histology, physiology and behavior). Covering sensitive developmental windows of eyes during early embryogenesis, acute or chronic exposure to xenobiotics can disturb the expressions of visual gene and protein markers, which affect the retinal neurogenesis and induce degeneration of neurons. Morphological structures and physiological responses of retina and optic rectum are then disorganized, eventually compromising the performance of visually-mediated behaviors and recruitment of individuals. Environmental pollutants can cross the blood-retina barrier and accumulate in eyes, which might impact visual system directly. In addition, pollutants are very likely to interrupt retinal development and function indirectly by disturbing the signaling of retinoids and thyroid. However, exact mechanisms of visual toxicity are largely unknown currently. In this review, the development and structure of retina and available tools for studying visual science are described briefly. Advances in visual toxicology are summarized in detail and outlooks for future visual toxicity studies are discussed.

TI  - Multi-Behavioral Endpoint Testing of an 87-Chemical Compound Library in Freshwater Planarians
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - There is an increased recognition in the field of toxicology of the value of medium-to-high-throughput screening methods using in vitro and alternative animal models. We have previously introduced the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a new alternative animal model and proposed that it is particularly well-suited for the study of developmental neurotoxicology. In this article, we discuss how we have expanded and automated our screening methodology to allow for fast screening of multiple behavioral endpoints, developmental toxicity, and mortality. Using an 87-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program, consisting of known and suspected neurotoxicants, including drugs, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and presumptive negative controls, we further evaluate the benefits and limitations of the system for medium-throughput screening, focusing on the technical aspects of the system. We show that, in the context of this library, planarians are the most sensitive to pesticides with 16/16 compounds causing toxicity and the least sensitive to PAHs, with only 5/17 causing toxicity. Furthermore, while none of the presumptive negative controls were bioactive in adult planarians, 2/5, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid, were bioactive in regenerating worms. Notably, these compounds were previously reported as developmentally toxic in mammalian studies. Through parallel screening of adults and developing animals, planarians are thus a useful model to detect such developmental-specific effects, which was observed for 13 chemicals in this library. We use the data and experience gained from this screen to propose guidelines for best practices when using planarians for toxicology screens.

TI  - Generation-specific and interactive effects of pesticide and antidepressant exposure in a fish model call for multi-stressor and multigenerational testing
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Ecological risks of a pollutant are typically assessed via short-term exposure of model organisms to that single compound. Such tests are informative, but cannot ascertain effects of long-term and multigenerational mixed-stressor exposure with which organisms are often confronted in their natural environment. Therefore, full lifecycle and multigenerational tests are needed. Yet, these are hampered due to long lifespans and generation times of many standard laboratory species, in particular for vertebrates such as fish. With a typical lifespan of 6 months and a generation time of about 3 months, the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) may be an ideal model for multigenerational testing. In this study, we assessed the impact of full life-cycle exposure to the emerging pollutant fluoxetine (0, 0.5 mu g/L) in combination with chronic exposure during adulthood to the pesticide 3,4-dichlomaniline (0, 50, 100 mu g/L) over two successive generations of N. furzeri. Overall, both life-history and behaviour were affected by exposure to fluoxetine and 3,4-DCA. Inhibitory effects of single chemical exposure on growth and fecundity were generation-dependent, while enhanced swimming acceleration and feeding in response to fluoxetine were dependent on the presence of 3,4-DCA. Together, these findings show the relevance of a multi-stressor approach across successive generations. Although full life-cycle and multigenerational tests are typically assumed to be impractical and costly for fish, we deliver an effective demonstration that such studies are possible within a timespan of less than 6 months with the killifish N. furzeri as a model organism.

TI  - Short-term and persistent impacts on behaviors related to locomotion, anxiety, and startle responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) induced by acute, sublethal exposure to chlorpyrifos
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Although most exposures to chlorpyrifos (CPF) in natural flowing waters are brief and episodic, there have been a few reports of the persistence of abnormal fish behaviors caused by such acute exposure. The present study focused on the behavioral and biochemical responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to acute, sublethal exposure to CPF, as well as the persistence of the effects during a 3-week recovery test in CPF-free water. The medaka became hyperactive and exhibited an elevated anxiety state after a 4-day exposure to 0.024 mg/L of CPF, but they recovered from these abnormal behavioral responses within 7 days of recovery treatment. In contrast, persistent impacts on some startle responses to a sudden stimulation (induced by a ball drop) were observed in medaka exposed to CPF. The reaction latency did not change immediately after the 4-day exposure, but was significantly prolonged by as much as 21 days after the termination of exposure. The post-stimulus swimming distance within 5 s significantly decreased on the day immediately after the 4-day exposure, but it significantly increased after 7 days of recovery treatment. The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brains of medaka was significantly inhibited on the day immediately after the 4-day exposure, but it returned to 80% and 110% of that in control fish on days 7 and 21 of the recovery period, respectively. However, AChE activities in the eyes of exposed medaka were persistently inhibited and declined to 33%, 71%, and 72% of that in control fish on days 0 (immediately after the 4-day exposure), 7, and 21 of recovery, respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that the changes of AChE activities in the brains of medaka may underlie some of the observed acute behavioral changes, and the changes of AChE activities in the eyes may contribute to the persistence of the abnormalities in the reaction latency of the startle response. Our findings suggest that medaka need a long time to recover from acute, sublethal exposure to CPF, and the persistence of the behavioral abnormalities might affect their fitness in natural habitats.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - An accurate controlled-release strategy of pesticides is considered desirable in sustainable agriculture. A site-specificnanorelease system of dazomet (DZ) was proposed by employing the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 composite (DZ@ZIF-8) by aone-pot method. The synthetic parameters of DZ@ZIF-8 were optimized, and the loading content of DZ was maximized. ZIF-8endowed DZ with a pH-sensitive behavior. The collapse of the DZ@ZIF-8 structure and the site-specific release of DZ weretriggered by acidic substances produced byBotrytis cinerea.In vitroand pot experiments showed that the fungicidal activity of DZ@ZIF-8 was about 36.3 and 42.7% higher than that of DZ, respectively. DZ is conventionally used before a crop is planted because ofits volatility and toxicity. However, DZ@ZIF-8 could avoid phytotoxicity of DZ to plants, which made the application of DZ possibleduring plant growth. Moreover, the acute toxicity to zebrafish changed from high to moderate levels. This study highlights a potentialstrategy that improves DZ effective utilization and reduces side effects.

T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Objective The objective of the present study was to elucidate the toxic effects of imidacloprid on the embryonic and larval stages of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Methods Each of the 1000 fertilized eggs and larvae were exposed to six different concentrations (0, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 mu g/L) of imidacloprid in 30 plastic bowls. Each of the control and treatment was maintained in five replicates. Results Results showed that hatching rate of fertilized eggs and number of dead embryos and larvae significantly decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations. The 24-, 48-, and 72-h LC50 value of imidacloprid for common carp embryos were estimated to be 12,708.8, 611, and 274.9 mu g/L, respectively and the 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h LC50 of imidacloprid for common carp larvae were estimated to be 93719, 21691, 2352.7, and 1292.6 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, results showed several malformations of common carp embryos and larvae induced by the toxicity of imidacloprid when exposed to 300 and 1000 mu g/L. Conclusion The results suggest that the minimum concentration of 10 mu g/L imidacloprid in the aquatic environment may have adverse effects on the embryonic and larval stages of common carp.

T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - This study was carried out to determine the effect of clotrimazole (CTZ), an imidazole fungicide on behavior, brain acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress parameters in Clarias gariepinus juveniles. Fish were acutely exposed to five nominal concentrations of CTZ and control to assess the behavioral effects on fish. To determine the effects on brain acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress parameters, fish were exposed to three sub-lethal concentrations vis 7.76, 3.89 and 1.94 mg/L which corresponds to 20 10 and 5% of 96 h LC50 value of CTZ respectively and a control for 21 days and allowed to recover for 7 days. The brain, liver and gills were sampled weekly. Fish exposed to different concentrations of the drug displayed behavioral responses such as reduced swimming rate, mucus secretion, decrease in both the feeding frequency and rate. A duration dependent increase in the levels of brain acetylcholinesterase was observed among the exposed groups. The result of the sub-lethal exposure revealed concentration and duration significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase activity (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxide (GPx) in both the liver and gill tissues of the exposed groups compared to the control. The effects of the drug on many of the observed parameters did not wane after the 7-day withdrawal period. This study revealed that CTZ has a negative impact on the observed parameters, thus providing additional evidence of its toxic effect on non-target aquatic species, especially fish.

TI  - Development of the Bi-Partite Gal4-UAS System in the African Malaria Mosquito, Anopheles gambiae
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Functional genetic analysis in Anopheles gambiae would be greatly improved by the development of a binary expression system, which would allow the more rapid and flexible characterisation of genes influencing disease transmission, including those involved in insecticide resistance, parasite interaction, host and mate seeking behaviour. The Gal4-UAS system, widely used in Drosophila melanogaster functional genetics, has been significantly modified to achieve robust application in several different species. Towards this end, previous work generated a series of modified Gal4 constructs that were up to 20 fold more active than the native gene in An. gambiae cells. To examine the Gal4-UAS system in vivo, transgenic An. gambiae driver lines carrying a modified Gal4 gene under the control of the carboxypeptidase promoter, and responder lines carrying UAS regulated luciferase and eYFP reporter genes have been created. Crossing of the Gal4 and UAS lines resulted in progeny that expressed both reporters in the expected midgut specific pattern. Although there was minor variation in reporter gene activity between the different crosses examined, the tissue specific expression pattern was consistent regardless of the genomic location of the transgene cassettes. The results show that the modified Gal4-UAS system can be used to successfully activate expression of transgenes in a robust and tissue specific manner in Anopheles gambiae. The midgut driver and dual reporter responder constructs are the first to be developed and tested successfully in transgenic An. gambiae and provide the basis for further advancement of the system in this and other insect species.

TI  - Review of emerging contaminant tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate: Environmental occurrence, exposure, and risks to organisms and human health
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is a halogen-containing organophosphorus chemical that is widely employed in various consumer products with a high production volume. As an additive flame retardant (FR), TDCPP tends to be released into the environment through multiple routes. It is ubiquitous in environmental media, biotic matrixes, and humans, and thus is deemed to be an emerging environmental contaminant. To date, significant levels of TDCPP and its primary diester metabolite, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, have been detected in human samples of seminal plasma, breast milk, blood plasma, placenta, and urine, thereby causing wide concern about the potential human health effects resulting from exposure to this chemical. Despite the progress in research on TDCPP over the past few years, we are still far from fully understanding the environmental behavior and health risks of this emerging contaminant. Thus, this paper critically reviews the environmental occurrence, exposure, and risks posed by TDCPP to organisms and human health among the literature published in the last decade. It has been demonstrated that TDCPP induces acute-, nerve-, developmental-, reproductive-, hepatic-, nephron-, and endocrine-disrupting toxicity in animals, which has caused increasing concern worldwide. Simultaneously, TDCPP induces cytotoxicity by increasing the formation of reactive oxygen species and inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in multiple human cell lines in vitro, and also causes endocrine-disrupting effects, including reproductive dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes, according to human epidemiology studies. This review not only provides a better understanding of the behavior of this emerging contaminant in the environment, but also enhances the comprehension of the health risks posed by TDCPP exposure to ecosystems and humans.

TI  - Low concentration of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) represents a risk to South American silver catfish Ramdia quelen (Quoy and Gaimard, 1824) population
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - The 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) is an environmental persistent pollutant widely used as flame retardant, antimicrobial and insecticide agent in wood preservation and plastic production. Currently, TBP is found in environmental compartments such as soil, freshwater, groundwater, sewage sludge and domestic dust, but the effects to biota and the risk of exposure to aquatic vertebrates are still scarce. In the present study, Rhamdia quelen fish embryos (8 h post-fertilization - hpf) were exposed to 0.3 and 3.0 mu g L-1 of TBP until 96 hpf. Biochemical biomarkers, hatching, survival and larvae/embryo malformations were evaluated after exposure. Additionally, a mathematical model was proposed to evaluate the effects along further generations. The results showed that TBP decreased the survival level but did not cause significant difference in the hatching rates. After 72 and 96 hpf, individuals from the highest tested concentration group showed more severe malformations than individuals from control and the lower concentrations groups. The deformities were concentrated on the embryos facial region where the sensorial structures related to fish behavior are present. The biochemical biomarkers revealed both oxidative stress and neurotoxicity signs after exposure to the contaminant, while the application of the mathematical model showed a decrease of population in both tested TBP concentrations. In conclusion, the current results demonstrated that TBP is toxic to R. quelen embryos and represents a risk to population after early life stage exposure.

TI  - Neurotoxicological and thyroid evaluations of rats developmentally exposed to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) and tris(2-chloro-2-ethyl)phosphate (TCEP)
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) and tris(2-chloro-2-ethyl)phosphate (TCEP) are organophosphorous flame retardants with widespread usage and human exposures through food, inhalation, and dust ingestion. They have been detected in human tissues including urine and breast milk. Reports of disrupted neural growth in vitro, abnormal development in larval zebrafish, and altered thyroid hormones in several species have raised concern for neurodevelopmental toxicity. This is especially the case for TDCIPP, which is more potent and has more activity in those assays than does TCEP. We evaluated the potential for developmental neurotoxicity of TDCIPP and TCEP in a mammalian model. Pregnant Long Evans rats were administered TDCIPP (15, 50, or 150 mg/kg/day) or TCEP (12, 40, 90 mg/kg/day) via oral gavage from gestational day 10 to weaning. Corn oil was the vehicle control in both studies. Body weight and righting reflex development were monitored in all pups. A subset of offspring at Culling and weaning, and dams at weaning, were sacrificed for serum and organ collection for measurement of brain, liver, and thyroid weights, serum thyroid levels, and serum and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. Brain weights were also measured in a group of adult TDCIPP-treated offspring. One male and one female from each litter were allocated for behavioral testing at several ages: standard locomotor activity (preweaning, postweaning, adults), locomotor activity including a lighting change mid-way (postweaning, adults), elevated zero maze (postweaning, adults), functional observational battery (FOB; postweaning, adults), and Morris water maze (place learning, reference and working memory; adults). Neither chemical produced changes in maternal body weight or serum thyroid hormones, but relative liver weight was increased at the high doses of both TDCIPP and TCEP. In offspring, there were no effects on viability, litter size, or birth weight. With TDCIPP, absolute liver weights were lower at weaning and weight gain was lower in the high-dose offspring until about two months of age. Thyroid hormones and brain weights were not altered and acetylcholinesterase (both brain and serum) was not inhibited by either chemical. TDCIPP-treated offspring showed slight differences in floating in the water maze, hindlimb grip strength, and altered activity habituation, whereas TCEP-treated rats showed differences in quadrant time (probe) and middle-zone preference in the water maze. Regarding these few changes, the effects were minimal, mostly not related to dose, and did not appear treatment-related or biologically significant Overall, these data do not support the potential for thyrotoxicity or developmental neurotoxicity produced by TDCIPP or TCEP.

TI  - Screening for neurotoxic potential of 15 flame retardants using freshwater planarians
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY
AB  - Asexual freshwater planarians are an attractive invertebrate model for high-throughput neurotoxicity screening, because they possess multiple quantifiable behaviors to assess distinct neuronal functions. Planarians uniquely allow direct comparisons between developing and adult animals to distinguish developmentally selective effects from general neurotoxicity. In this study, we used our automated planarian screening platform to compare the neurotoxicity of 15 flame retardants (FRs), consisting of representative phased-out brominated (BFRs) and replacement organophosphorus FRs (OPFRs). OPFRs have emerged as a proposed safer alternative to BFRs; however, limited information is available on their health effects. We found 11 of the 15 FRs (3/6 BFRs, 7/8 OPFRs, and Firemaster 550) caused adverse effects in both adult and developing planarians with similar nominal lowest-effect-levels for BFRs and OPFRs. This suggests that replacement OPFRs are comparably neurotoxic to the phased-out compounds. BFRs were primarily systemically toxic, whereas OPFRs, except Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, shared a behavioral phenotype in response to noxious heat at sublethal concentrations, indicating specific neurotoxic effects. We found this behavioral phenotype was correlated with cholinesterase inhibition, thus linking behavioral outcomes to molecular targets. By directly comparing effects on adult and developing planarians, we further found that one BFR (3,3',5,5'-Tetrabromobisphenol A) caused a developmental selective defect. Together, these results demonstrate that our planarian screening platform yields high content data from various behavioral and morphological endpoints, allowing us to distinguish selective neurotoxic effects and effects specific to the developing nervous system. Ten of these 11 bioactive FRs were previously found to be bioactive in other models, including cell culture and alternative animal models (nematodes and zebrafish). This level of concordance across different platforms emphasizes the urgent need for further evaluation of OPFRs in mammalian systems.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of pesticides.
T2  - Acta neuropathologica
AB  - Pesticides are unique environmental contaminants that are specifically introduced into the environment to control pests, often by killing them. Although pesticide application serves many important purposes, including protection against crop loss and against vector-borne diseases, there are significant concerns over the potential toxic effects of pesticides to non-target organisms, including humans. In many cases, the molecular target of a pesticide is shared by non-target species, leading to the potential for untoward effects. Here, we review the history of pesticide usage and the neurotoxicity of selected classes of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, to humans and experimental animals. Specific emphasis is given to linkages between exposure to pesticides and risk of neurological disease and dysfunction in humans coupled with mechanistic findings in humans and animal models. Finally, we discuss emerging techniques and strategies to improve translation from animal models to humans.

TI  - Development toxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish from exposure to iprodione.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Iprodione is a highly effective broad-spectrum fungicide commonly used for early disease control in fruit trees and vegetables. Pesticides often flow into watercourses due to rainfall, causing toxicity in non-target organisms, eventually entering the food chain. However, little information is available in the current literature about the toxicity of iprodione to cardiac development. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of iprodione on early embryonic development and its cardiotoxicity in aquatic animals, using zebrafish as a model. At 6-72 h post-fertilization (hpf), zebrafish were exposed to concentrations of 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 25 mg/L (72 h-LC(50) = 21.15 mg/L). We found that exposure to iprodione resulted in yolk edema, increased mortality, and shortened body length in zebrafish embryos. In addition, iprodione was also found to induce edema in the pericardium of zebrafish, decrease heart rate, and cause the failure of cardiac cyclization. Exposure to iprodione significantly increased the accumulation of ROS and altered the activity of antioxidant enzymes (MDA, CAT) in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, iprodione induced changes in the transcription levels of heart developmental-related genes and apoptosis-related genes. In addition, Astaxanthin (antioxidant) can partially rescue the toxic phenotype caused by iprodione. Apoptosis-related genes and heart developmental-related genes were rescued after astaxanazin treatment. The results suggest that iprodione induces developmental and cardiac toxicity in zebrafish embryos, which provides new evidence of the toxicity of iprodione to organisms in aquatic ecosystems and assessing human health risks.

TI  - Developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of penconazole enantiomers exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Penconazole is a widely used chiral triazole bactericide that may adversely affect the environment. It contains two corresponding enantiomers and there may be differences in toxicity between the isomers. Therefore, in this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to different concentrations of the penconazole enantiomer to study the developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of penconazole on zebrafish and the difference in toxicity between enantiomers. The results showed that penconazole exposure caused adverse effects on zebrafish embryos, such as autonomous motor abnormalities, heart rate slowing, and increased deformity, resulting in significant developmental toxicity. Meanwhile, also caused the zebrafish larvae to slow movement, the neurotransmitter content and nervous system related gene expression significantly changed, which proved that penconazole also caused neurotoxicity to zebrafish. Interestingly, our results also clearly show that (+)-penconazole is significantly more toxic to zebrafish than (-)-penconazole at the same concentration, whether it is developmental toxicity or neurotoxicity, which suggests that we should focus on (+)-penconazole more when conducting toxicological studies on penconazole.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of trichloroethylene in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental science. Processes & impacts
AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE), an industrial solvent and degreaser, is an environmental toxicant that contaminates over half of Superfund sites, is a known carcinogen, and is linked to congenital defects and neurodegenerative disease. The developmental toxicity of TCE near ecologically relevant levels needs further characterization in order to better assess health risks of exposure. In this study, the toxicodynamics of TCE in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model was investigated through the establishment of a LC50 concentration and by monitoring the acute developmental toxicity of ecologically relevant concentrations (0, 5, 50, and 500 parts per billion; ppb) of TCE during two different exposure lengths (1-72 hours post fertilization (hpf) and 1-120 hpf). Acute developmental toxicity was assessed by monitoring survival and hatching, larval morphology, larval heart rate, and behavioral responses during an embryonic photomotor response test and a larval visual motor response test. Embryonic exposure to TCE was associated with decreased percent hatch at 48 hpf, altered larval morphology, increased heart rate, and altered behavioral responses during the photomotor response test and visual motor response test. Larval morphology and behavioral alterations were more pronounced in the 1-120 hpf exposure length trials. The observed alterations suggest developmental TCE toxicity is still a concern at regulatory concentrations and that timing of exposure influences developmental toxicity.

TI  - Cannabis constituents reduce seizure behavior in chemically-induced and scn1a-mutant zebrafish.
T2  - Epilepsy & behavior : E&B
AB  - Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are undesirable for many reasons including the inability to reduce seizures in certain types of epilepsy, such as Dravet syndrome (DS) where in one-third of patients does not respond to current AEDs, and severe adverse effects that are frequently experienced by patients. Epidiolex, a cannabidiol (CBD)-based drug, was recently approved for treatment of DS. While Epidiolex shows great promise in reducing seizures in patients with DS, it is used in conjunction with other AEDs and can cause liver toxicity. To investigate whether other cannabis-derived compounds could also reduce seizures, the antiepileptic effects of CBD, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabinol (CBN), and linalool (LN) were compared in both a chemically-induced (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ) and a DS (scn1Lab(-/-)) seizure models. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) that were either wild-type (Tupfel longfin) or scn1Lab(-/-) (DS) were exposed to CBD, THC, CBDV, CBN, or LN for 24 h from 5 to 6 days postfertilization. Following exposure, total distance traveled was measured in a ViewPoint Zebrabox to determine if these compounds reduced seizure-like activity. Cannabidiol (0.6 and 1 μM) and THC (1 and 4 μM) significantly reduced PTZ-induced total distance moved. At the highest THC concentration, the significant reduction in PTZ-induced behavior was likely the result of sedation as opposed to antiseizure activity. In the DS model, CBD (0.6 μM), THC (1 μM), CBN (0.6 and 1 μM), and LN (4 μM) significantly reduced total distance traveled. Cannabinol was the most effective at reducing total distance relative to controls. In addition to CBD, other cannabis-derived compounds showed promise in reducing seizure-like activity in zebrafish. Specifically, four of the five compounds were effective in the DS model, whereas in the PTZ model, only CBD and THC were, suggesting a divergence in the mode of action among the cannabis constituents.

TI  - Fenobucarb-induced developmental neurotoxicity and mechanisms in zebrafish.
T2  - Neurotoxicology
AB  - Fenobucarb (2-sec-butylphenyl methylcarbamate, BPMC) is an extensively used carbamate insecticide. Its developmental neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms have not been well investigated. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations of BPMC from 6 hpf (hours post fertilization, hpf) to 120 hpf. BPMC induced developmental toxicity with reduced motility in larval zebrafish. The spinal cord neutrophil infiltration, increased ROS production, caspase 3 and 9 activation, central nerve and peripheral motor neuron damage, axon and myelin degeneration were observed in zebrafish treated with BPMC generally in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of eight marker genes for nervous system function or development, namely, a1-tubulin, shha, elavl3, gap43, syn2a, gfap, mbp and manf, was significantly downregulated following BPMC exposure. AChE activity reduction and ache gene expression suppression was also found significantly in BPMC-treated zebrafish. These results indicate that BPMC is highly toxic to zebrafish and that BPMC induces zebrafish developmental neurotoxicity through pathways involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, degeneration and apoptosis.

TI  - Histology and multi-omic profiling reveal the mixture toxicity of tebuconazole and difenoconazole in adult zebrafish.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The combination effects of triazole fungicides on aquatic organisms remain largely unknown. In current study, an integrated histological, transcriptome, metabonomics and microbiology was applied to investigate the mixture effects and risk of tebuconazole (TEB) and difenoconazole (DIF) co-exposure on zebrafish liver and gonad at aquatic life benchmark. TEB and DIF mixture showed additive effect on the acute toxicity to adult zebrafish, the combined toxicity on liver was less than the additive effect of individual TEB and DIF, and TEB and DIF mixture also reduced the toxic effects on gonad and intestinal microflora. Transcriptomics and metabolomics further showed TEB and DIF mixture could induce more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to regulate the metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism and microbial metabolism, to balance the energy metabolism and supplies, and maintain the steroid hormone and RA level, further reduced the toxic effect on liver and gonad caused by TEB and DIF. Our results showed the different responses and patterns on transcriptional and metabolic profiles mediated in the diverse toxicity and combination effects of TEB and DIF. The present results provided a deep mechanistic understanding of the combined effects and mode of action of DIF and TEB mixture on aquatic organisms, suggesting the concept of additive effects might sufficiently protective when evaluated the combination effects and ecological risk of TEB and DIF at aquatic life benchmarks.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - An environmentally-friendly and fast analytical method for the stereoselective determination of etoxazole was developed and then applied to estimate stereoselective bioaccumulation and elimination in zebrafish using SFC-MS/MS. Optimal enantioseparation conditions were determined using a Chiralpak IG-3 column and CO(2)/MeOH mobile phase (80/20, v/v), at 3.0 mL/min within 1 min, 30°Me and 18 MPa. A modified QuEChERS method was developed for zebrafish sample pretreatment, and mean recoveries were 88.43-110.12% with relative standard deviations ranging from 0.32 to 5.34%. The enantioselectives of etoxazole enantiomers in zebrafish during uptake and depuration phases were evaluated. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed, with preferential accumulation of (-)-R-etoxazole compared to its antipode, during uptake at both low and high exposure concentrations. The toxic effects of etoxazole on zebrafish were further explored, and activities of antioxidant enzymes were determined in liver of zebrafish. Significant changes were observed in the SOD and GST activities and in the MDA levels, which indicated the occurrence of oxidative stress in liver of zebrafish. The toxic effects exhibited time- and dose-dependent properties. These results can facilitate the accurate risk evaluation of etoxazole and provide basic knowledge for further study of biotoxicity mechanisms.

TI  - Interactions of Fipronil within Fish and Insects: Experimental and Molecular Modeling Studies.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - Fipronil is an efficient phenylpyrazole insecticide that acts on insect γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABARs) and has low toxicity to mammals but high toxicity to nontarget organisms such as fish. To develop novel efficient low-toxicity insecticides, it is necessary to determine the detailed toxic mechanism at the molecular target level. In this work, methods including affinity chromatography, fluorescent-labeled binding assays, and molecular modeling were integrated to explore the binding of fipronil to GABARs in fish ( Aristichthys nobilis) and insects ( Musca domestica). Affinity chromatography revealed that fipronil acts on two different subunits of GABARs in fish and M. domestica. Moreover, fluorescence assays revealed that fipronil exhibits similar affinity to the two GABARs. The K(d) and B(max) of fipronil binding to the A. nobilis GABAR were 346 ± 6 nmol/L and 40.6 ± 3.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. And the K(d) and B(max) of fipronil binding to the GABAR in M. domestica brain were 109 ± 9 nM and 21.3 ± 2.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. In addition, similar fipronil binding positions but different binding modes were observed in docking studies with Brachydanio rerio var. and M. domestica GABARs. These findings indicated similar interactions of fipronil with fish and insects, leading to high toxicity. The different binding features of fipronil between the two species might be helpful for the design and development of highly selective insecticides with low toxicity to fish.

TI  - Biotransformation Capacity of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Early Life Stages: Functionality of the Mercapturic Acid Pathway.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) early life stages offer a versatile model system to study the efficacy and safety of drugs or other chemicals with regard to human and environmental health. This is because, aside from the well-characterized genome of zebrafish and the availability of a broad range of experimental and computational research tools, they are exceptionally well suited for high-throughput approaches. Yet, one important pharmacokinetic aspect is thus far only poorly understood in zebrafish embryo and early larvae: their biotransformation capacity. Especially, biotransformation of electrophilic compounds is a critical pathway because they easily react with nucleophile molecules, such as DNA or proteins, potentially inducing adverse health effects. To combat such adverse effects, conjugation reactions with glutathione and further processing within the mercapturic acid pathway have evolved. We here explore the functionality of this pathway in zebrafish early life stages using a reference substrate (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, CDNB). With this work, we show that zebrafish embryos can biotransform CDNB to the respective glutathione conjugate as early as 4 h postfertilization. At all examined life stages, the glutathione conjugate is further biotransformed to the last metabolite of the mercapturic acid pathway, the mercapturate, which is slowly excreted. Being able to biotransform electrophiles within the mercapturic acid pathway shows that zebrafish early life stages possess the potential to process xenobiotic compounds through glutathione conjugation and the formation of mercapturates. The presence of this chemical biotransformation and clearance route in zebrafish early life stages supports the application of this model in toxicology and chemical hazard assessment.

TI  - Thiophanate-methyl induces severe hepatotoxicity in zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Thiophanate-methyl (TM) is widely used all over the world and is a typical example of pesticide residues, which can be detected in the soil, and even in vegetables and fruits. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatotoxicity of TM are not well understood. In this study, we utilized zebrafish to comprehensively evaluate the hepatotoxicity of TM and explore how the molecular mechanisms of hepatotoxicity are induced. The zebrafish larvae were exposed in 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/L TM from 72 to 144 hpf, while the adults were exposed in 2, 4 and 6 mg/L TM for 28 days. Here, we found that 12.5 and 25 mg/L TM induces specifically serious hepatotoxicity but not the toxicity of other organs in zebrafish larvae and adults. Moreover, it might triggered hepatotoxicity by activating the caspase-3 through apoptotic pathways and oxidative stress in zebrafish. Subsequently, this resulted in a metabolic imbalance in the zebrafish's liver. In conclusion, our results disclosed the fact that TM may induce severe hepatotoxicity by mediating activation of caspase-3 and oxidative stress in zebrafish.

AB  - 1,1-Trichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl) ethane (o,p'-DDT) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) cause thyroid disruption, but the underlying mechanisms of these disturbances in fish remain unclear. To explore the potential mechanisms of thyroid dysfunction caused by o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, thyroid hormone and gene expression levels in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were measured, and the developmental toxicity were recorded in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish embryos/larvae were exposed to o,p'-DDT (0, 0.28, 2.8, and 28 nM; or 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L) and p,p'-DDE (0, 1.57, 15.7, and 157 nM; or 0, 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/L) for 7 days. The genes related to thyroid hormone synthesis (crh, tshβ, tg, nis and tpo) and thyroid development (nkx2.1 and pax8) were up-regulated in both the o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE exposure groups. Zebrafish embryos/larvae exposed to o,p'-DDT showed significantly increased total whole-body T4 and T3 levels, with the expression of ugt1ab and dio3 being significantly down-regulated. However, the p,p'-DDE exposure groups showed significantly lowered whole-body total T4 and T3 levels, which were associated with up-regulation and down-regulation expression of the expression of dio2 and ugt1ab, respectively. Interestingly, the ratio of T3 to T4 was significantly decreased in the o,p'-DDT (28 nM) and p,p'-DDE (157 nM) exposure groups, suggesting an impairment of thyroid function. In addition, reduced survival rates and body lengths and increased malformation rates were recorded after treatment with either o,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE. In summary, our study indicates that the disruption of thyroid states was different in response to o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE exposure in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Rotenone impairs oxidant/antioxidant balance both in brain and intestines in zebrafish.
T2  - The International journal of neuroscience
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Rotenone is a commonly used pesticide that inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport system. Rotenone exposed rats demonstrate many characteristics of Parkinson Disease (PD). Oxidative stress is one of the hallmarks of PD, being the major sources of ROS in the DA neurons. In recent years the strong connection between the intestinal environment and the function of the central nervous system (CNS) has gained widespread popularity. In order to explain the mechanism underlying the GI dysfunction in PD, we aimed to investigate oxidant-antioxidant status in the brain and intestine, as well as locomotor activity, in rotenone exposed zebrafish. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult zebrafish were exposed to 2 mg/L rotenone for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, locomotor activity was determined by simple observation. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined in the homogenates. RESULTS: Locomotor activity decreased in the rotenone exposed zebrafish. LPO increased in both brain and intestines whereas NO increased only in the brain. Decreased GST and CAT activities were found in both tissues whereas SOD activity decreased only in the intestines. CONCLUSION: As a conclusion, the results of our study support the connection between gut and brain axis in rotenone exposed zebrafish by means of oxidative stress and NO for the first time in literature.

TI  - Isoflucypram cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Isoflucypram belongs to the new generation of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides that are commonly used in crop fungal disease control. Evidence indicates that isoflucypram poses a potential risk to aquatic organisms. However, the effects of isoflucypram during early embryogenesis are not fully understood. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.025, 0.25, or 2.5 μM isoflucypram for three days. Isoflucypram caused severe developmental abnormalities (yolk sac edema, pericardial edema, and blood clotting clustering), hatching delay, and decreased heart rates in zebrafish. The expression levels of cardiac-specific genes (nkx2.5, myh7, myl7, and myh6) and erythropoiesis-related genes (gata1a, hbbe1, hbbe2, and alas2) were disrupted after isoflucypram exposure. Furthermore, enrichment analysis indicated that most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in heart development or hemopoiesis processes. Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to isoflucypram is associated with developmental and cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish.

TI  - Kidney developmental effects of metal-herbicide mixtures: Implications for chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology.
T2  - Environment international
AB  - Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is an emerging global concern affecting several agricultural communities in the Americas and South Asia. Environmental contaminants such as heavy metals (e.g., Cd, As, Pb, and V) and organic pesticides (e.g., glyphosate) in the drinking water have been hypothesized to play a role in childhood onset and progression of this disease. However, a comprehensive analysis of chemical contaminants in the drinking water and effects of these compounds and their mixtures on kidney development and function remains unknown. Here, we conducted targeted and non-targeted chemical analyses of sediment and drinking water in CKDu affected regions in Sri Lanka, one of the most affected countries. Using zebrafish Danio rerio, a toxicology and kidney disease model, we then examined kidney developmental effects of exposure to (i) environmentally derived samples from CKDu endemic and non-endemic regions and (ii) Cd, As, V, Pb, and glyphosate as individual compounds and in mixtures. We found that drinking water is contaminated with various organic chemicals including nephrotoxic compounds as well as heavy metals, but at levels considered safe for drinking. Histological studies and gene expression analyses examining markers of kidney development (pax2a) and kidney injury (kim1) showed novel metal and glyphosate-metal mixture specific effects on kidney development. Mitochondrial dysfunction is directly linked to kidney failure, and examination of mixture specific mitochondrial toxicity showed altered mitochondrial function following treatment with environmental samples from endemic regions. Collectively, we show that metals in drinking water, even at safe levels, can impede kidney development at an early age, potentiating increased susceptibility to other agrochemicals such as glyphosate. Drinking water contaminant effects on mitochondria can further contribute to progression of kidney dysfunction and our mitochondrial assay may help identify regions at risk of CKDu.

TI  - Embryotoxicity of atrazine and its degradation products to early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Triazine herbicide atrazine is considered to be moderately toxic to various aquatic animals. The aim of our study was to evaluate the acute embryotoxicity of atrazine and its two degradation products, desisopropylatrazine and desethylatrazine, and their mixture to the early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) by means of a modified method of the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) Test - OECD guideline 236. Toxic effects were studied by the evaluation of lethal endpoints and development of disorders. Furthermore, sublethal endpoints such as hatching rate, formation of somites, development of eyes, spontaneous movement, heartbeat, blood circulation, pigmentation and occurrence of edema at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post fertilization were assessed. Newly fertilized eggs were exposed to various concentrations of atrazine, desisopropylatrazine and desethylatrazine, and their combination 0.3, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3,000 and 10,000 μg/l, which represent environmentally relevant levels of these pollutants in surface waters and multiples of these concentrations to find out if the toxic effect depends on dose. Single substances and their combination were not associated with a negative effect on mortality. Rare malformations were observed during these embryonal toxicity tests. Only pericardial edema was recorded during the monitored observation. A significant increase in the occurrence of pericardial edema between the control 0% and the experimental group 17.6 %) was found only in the group exposed to the highest concentration of a triazine herbicide combination (10,000 μg/l) at 72 and 96 h post fertilization. Obtained results indicate that especially higher not environmentally relevant concentrations of atrazine, its metabolites or their combination present a potencial risk of embryotoxicity for zebrafish.

TI  - Bifenazate induces developmental and immunotoxicity in zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Bifenazate is a widely used acaricide, but its biological safety remains unknown. In the present study, the immunotoxic effects of exposure to bifenazate on zebrafish larvae were evaluated for the first time. Firstly, after exposure to bifenazate, the body length of the zebrafish larvae became shorter and the yolk sac swelled. Secondly, the number of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells was greatly reduced. Following exposure to bifenazate, oxidative stress levels in the zebrafish increased significantly, antioxidant activity was inhibited, and the expression of genes related to antioxidants, such as those of the glutathione metabolism pathway, changed, including gclm, prdx1, serpine1, and gss. In addition, inflammatory factors such as CXCL-c1c, IFN-γ, iL-8, iL-6, and MYD88 were abnormally expressed. The use of astaxanthin was effective in rescuing the developmental toxicity caused by bifenazate exposure. In summary, bifenazate exposure is immunotoxic and can cause oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae.

T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Triazole fungicides are widely used in agriculture production and have adverse impacts on aquatic organisms. As one of the triazole fungicides, prothioconazole has been reported to cause many toxicological effects, but its risks to aquatic organisms are unknown. In this study, we systematically explored the toxicity effects of prothioconazole exposure on zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) involving in developmental toxicity, oxidative damage and metabolism disorders. The results showed that prothioconazole exposure to zebrafish embryos produced a series of toxic symptoms, including hatching inhibition, shortening of body length, pericardial cyst and yolk cyst. In addition, prothioconazole exposure caused significant lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage. Particularly, we also found that metabolites and genes involved in lipid metabolism also showed significant changes. This study may provide theoretical basis for systematically assessing the potential risks of zebrafish embryos with prothioconazole exposure.

TI  - Combined toxic effects of fludioxonil and triadimefon on embryonic development of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Pesticides scarcely exist as individual compounds in the water ecosystem, but rather as mixtures of multiple chemicals at relatively low concentrations. In this study, we aimed to explore the mixture toxic effects of fludioxonil (FLU) and triadimefon (TRI) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) by employing different toxicological endpoints. Results revealed that the 96-h LC(50) values of FLU to D. rerio at multiple developmental stages ranged from 0.055 (0.039-0.086) to 0.61 (0.33-0.83) mg L(-1), which were less than those of TRI ranging from 3.08 (1.84-5.96) to 9.75 (5.99-14.78) mg L(-1). Mixtures of FLU and TRI exerted synergistic effects on embryonic zebrafish. Activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) were markedly altered in most of the individual and pesticide mixture treatments compared with the control. The expressions of 16 genes involved in oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, immune system and endocrine system displayed that embryonic zebrafish were affected by the individual pesticides and their mixtures, and greater variations of four genes (ERɑ, Tnf, IL and bax) were found when exposed to pesticide mixtures compared with their individual compounds. Therefore, more studies on mixture toxicities among different pesticides should be taken as a priority when evaluating their ecological risk.

T2  - The International journal of neuroscience
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible protective effects of mitoquinone and oleandrin on rotenone induced Parkinson’s disease in zebrafish. Materials and methods: Adult zebrafish were exposed to rotenone and mitoquinone for 30 days. Biochemical parameters were determined by spectrophotometric method and Parkinson’s disease-related gene expressions were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Measurement of neurotransmitters was performed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry instrument. The accumulation of synuclein was demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining. In vitro thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide method was applied to determine the mitochondrial function of synaptosomal brain fractions using rotenone as a neurotoxic agent and mitoquinone and oleandrin as neuroprotective agents. Results: Mitoquinone improved the oxidant-antioxidant balance and neurotransmitter levels that were disrupted by rotenone. Mitoquinone also ameliorated the expressions of Parkinson’s disease-related gene expressions that were disrupted by rotenone. According to thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay results, mitoquinone and oleandrin increased mitochondrial function which was decreased due to rotenone exposure. Conclusion: Based on the results of our study, positive effects of mitoquinone were observed in Parkinson’s disease model induced by rotenone in zebrafish. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Functional and behavioral signatures of Kv7 activator drug subtypes.
T2  - Epilepsia
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Voltage-gated potassium channels of the KCNQ (Kv7) family are targeted by a variety of activator compounds with therapeutic potential for treatment of epilepsy. Exploration of this drug class has revealed a variety of effective compounds with diverse mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to clarify functional criteria for categorization of Kv7 activator compounds, and to compare the effects of prototypical drugs in a zebrafish larvae model. METHODS: In vitro electrophysiological approaches with recombinant ion channels were used to highlight functional properties important for classification of drug mechanisms. We also benchmarked the effects of representative antiepileptic Kv7 activator drugs using behavioral seizure assays of zebrafish larvae and in vivo Ca(2+) imaging with the ratiometric Ca(2+) sensor CaMPARI. RESULTS: Drug effects on channel gating kinetics, and drug sensitivity profiles to diagnostic channel mutations, were used to highlight properties for categorization of Kv7 activator drugs into voltage sensor-targeted or pore-targeted subtypes. Quantifying seizures and ratiometric Ca(2+) imaging in freely swimming zebrafish larvae demonstrated that while all Kv7 activators tested lead to suppression of neuronal excitability, pore-targeted activators (like ML213 and retigabine) strongly suppress seizure behavior, whereas ICA-069673 triggers a seizure-like hypermotile behavior. SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests criteria to categorize antiepileptic Kv7 activator drugs based on their underlying mechanism. We also establish the use of in vivo CaMPARI as a tool for screening effects of anticonvulsant drugs on neuronal excitability in zebrafish. In summary, despite a shared ability to suppress neuronal excitability, our findings illustrate how mechanistic differences between Kv7 activator subtypes influence their effects on heteromeric channels and lead to vastly different in vivo outcomes.

TI  - Synergistic effect of fenpropathrin and paclobutrazol on early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Aquatic organisms are usually exposed to various co-existing pollutants. However, toxic effects of pesticide mixtures on aquatic organisms and its potential underlying mechanism still remain unclear. The joint effects of fenpropathrin (FEN) and paclobutrazol (PAC) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) using diverse toxicological endpoints were investigated in the current work. Our data exhibited that the 96-h LC(50) values of FEN to zebrafish at multiple life phases ranged from 0.0029 (0.0013-0.0042) to 0.16 (0.082-0.23) mg a.i. L(-1), which were lower by comparison to PAC ranging from 13.16 (8.564-21.03) to 23.43 (17.94-29.91) mg a.i. L(-1). Combination of FEN and PAC displayed synergistic effect on embryonic zebrafish. Activities of T-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD and CYP450 were remarkably changed in the majority of single and mixture treatments by comparison to the untreated group. The mRNA levels of 17 genes related to oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, immune system and endocrine system were assessed, and the data suggested that embryonic zebrafish were affected by both single pesticides and their mixtures. Five genes (P53, tsh, ERα, crh and cxcl-clc) showed greater alterations when exposed to pesticide mixtures by comparison to their individual chemicals. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to conduct more studies on mixture toxicities of different pesticides to explore the chemical mixtures with synergistic interactions.

T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - The standard methods for toxicity testing using rodent models cannot keep pace with the increasing number of chemicals in our environment due to time and resource limitations. Hence, there is an unmet need for fast, sensitive, and cost-effective alternate models to reliably predict toxicity. As part of Tox21 Phase III's effort, a 90-compound library was created and made available to researchers to screen for neurotoxicants using novel technology and models. The chemical library was evaluated in zebrafish in a dose-range finding test for embryo-toxicity (ie, mortality or morphological alterations induced by each chemical). In addition, embryos exposed to the lowest effect level and nonobservable effect level were used to measure the internal concentration of the chemicals within the embryos by bioanalysis. Finally, considering the lowest effect level as the highest testing concentration, a functional assay was performed based on locomotor activity alteration in response to light-dark changes. The quality control chemicals included in the library, ie, negative controls and replicated chemicals, indicate that the assays performed were reliable. The use of analytical chemistry pointed out the importance of measuring chemical concentration inside embryos, and in particular, in the case of negative chemicals to avoid false negative classification. Overall, the proposed approach presented a good sensitivity and supports the inclusion of zebrafish assays as a reliable, relevant, and efficient screening tool to identify, prioritize, and evaluate chemical toxicity.

AB  - Pyriproxyfen is an insecticide used worldwide that acts as a biomimetic of juvenile hormone. This study investigated metabolic and synaptic impairments triggered by pyriproxyfen using zebrafish acetylcholinesterase (zbAChE) and mitochondria as markers. A brain zbAChE assay was performed in vitro and in vivo covering a range of pyriproxyfen concentrations (0.001-10 μmol/L) to assess inhibition kinetics. Docking simulations were performed to characterize inhibitory interactions. Zebrafish male adults were acutely exposed to 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 μg/mL pyriproxyfen for 16 h. Mitochondrial respiration of brain tissues was assessed. ROS generation was estimated using H(2)DCF-DA and MitoSOX. Calcium transport was monitored by Calcium Green™ 5 N. NO synthesis activity was estimated using DAF-FM-DA. Brain acetylcholinesterase showed an in vivo IC(20) of 0.30 μmol/L pyriproxyfen, and an IC(50) of 92.5 μmol/L. The inhibitory effect on zbAChE activity was competitive-like. Respiratory control of Complex I/II decreased significantly after insecticide exposure. The MitoSOX test showed that O(2)(-) generation had a pyriproxyfen dose-dependent effect. Brain tissue lost 50% of Ca(2+) uptake capacity at 0.1 μg/mL pyriproxyfen. Ca(2+) release showed a clear mitochondrial impairment at lower pyriproxyfen exposures. Thus, Ca(2+) transport imbalance caused by pyriproxyfen may be a novel deleterious mechanism of action. Overall, the results showed that pyriproxyfen can compromise multiple and interconnected pathways: (1) zbAChE impairment and (2) the functioning of the electron transport chain, ROS generation and calcium homeostasis in zebrafish brain mitochondria. Considering the many similarities between zebrafish and human, more caution is needed when pyriproxyfen is used in both urban and agricultural pest control.

TI  - Bioaccumulation mechanism of organophosphate esters in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Although organophosphate esters (OPEs) have been detected with growing frequency in water ecosystems, the underlying accumulation mechanisms of these compounds in fish are still unknown. Here, we investigated the tissue-specific accumulation and depuration of seven OPEs in adult zebrafish at three levels (0, 1/150 LC(50) (environmentally relevant level), and 1/30 LC(50) per OPE congener) in laboratory after 19 days exposure and 3 days depuration. The bioaccumulation of OPEs varied among tissues. Muscle contained the lowest level of OPEs and liver had the highest level of two (TPP and TCEP) of the seven OPEs at steady state. The high levels and slow depuration rates of TDCIPP, TPHP, and TCP observed in roe indicated that the accumulated OPEs were potentially stored in roe and transferred to the next generation. After examination of the major metabolites (organophosphate diesters) in selected tissues, a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model used in fish was adopted to explore the key factors affecting the bioaccumulation of OPEs in zebrafish. Biotransformation of OPEs with polychlorinated alkyl moieties (i.e. TDCIPP) and aryl moieties (i.e. TPHP and TCP) has more significant impacts on the accumulation than those of OPEs with alkyl or short chain chlorinated alkyl moieties. Furthermore, the partition process between tissues and blood was also investigated, and was demonstrated to be the dominant process for OPEs accumulation in zebrafish. This study provides critical information on the bioaccumulation, tissue distribution, and metabolization of OPEs in relation with OPE structures in fish, as well as the underlying bioaccumulation mechanisms/pathways of OPEs in aquatic life.

TI  - Toxicity effects of procymidone, iprodione and their metabolite of 3,5-dichloroaniline to zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Dicarboximide fungicides mainly including procymidone, iprodione, vinclozolin, and dimethachlon are often applied as protective fungicides, 3,5-dichloroaniline (3,5-DCA) is their common metabolite in plant and environment. In this study, the acute toxicity of procymidone, iprodione and their metabolite of 3,5-DCA toward zebrafish was evaluated by semi-static method. The enrichment and metabolism of procymidone and iprodione in zebrafish were also clarified. The results indicated that procymidone and iprodione exhibited moderately toxic to adult zebrafish with the LC(50) of 2.00 mg/L, 5.70 mg/L at 96 h. Both procymidone and iprodione could be metabolized to 3,5-DCA in zebrafish, which showed higher toxic to adult zebrafish with the LC(50) of 1.64 mg/L at 96 h. From the perspective of histomorphology, for all treatment groups, the brain of the zebrafish was significantly damaged, while the damage to gut and gills was lighter. For procymidone, the biological concentration factor (BCF(8d)) were 236 and 246 at the exposure concentration of 0.2 mg/L and 0.04 mg/L, and the BCF(8d) were 3.2 and 2.4 for iprodione at the exposure concentration of 0.5 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L. Therefore, the procymidone and iprodione were moderate-enriched and low-enriched in zebrafish, respectively.

TI  - Changes of embryonic development, locomotor activity, and metabolomics in zebrafish co-exposed to chlorpyrifos and deltamethrin.
T2  - Journal of applied toxicology : JAT
AB  - Organophosphates (OPs) and pyrethroids (PYRs) are extensively used pesticides and often occur in the form of mixture, whereas little was known about their joint toxicities. We aim to investigate the individual and joint effects of OPs and PYRs exposure on zebrafish embryo by employing chlorpyrifos (CPF) and deltamethrin (DM) as representatives. Zebrafish embryos at 2 hours post fertilization (hpf) were exposed to CPF (4.80, 39.06, and 78.13 μg/L), DM exposure (0.06, 1.60, and 3.19 μg/L), and CPF + DM (4.80 + 0.06, 39.06 + 1.60, and 78.13 + 3.19 μg/L) until 144 hpf. Embryonic development, locomotor activity, and metabolomic changes were recorded and examined. Results displayed that individual exposure to CPF and DM significantly increased the mortality and malformation rate of zebrafish embryos, but decreased hatching rate was only found in CPF + DM co-exposure groups (p \textless .05). Meanwhile, individual CPF exposure had no detrimental effect on locomotor activity, high dose of individual CPF exposure decreased the swimming speed but had adaptability to the conversion from dark to light, whereas high dose of CPF + DM co-exposure exhibited not only significant decline in swimming speed but also no adaptability to the repeated stimulations, suggesting deficit in learning and memory function. In metabolomic analysis, individual CPF exposure mainly influenced the metabolism of glycerophospholipids and amino acids, individual DM exposure mainly influenced glycerophospholipids, and CPF + DM co-exposure mainly influenced glycerophospholipids and amino acids. Taken together, our findings suggested the embryonic toxicities and neurobehavioral changes caused by CPF and/or DM exposure. The disorder metabolomics of glycerophospholipids and amino acids might be involved in the underlying mechanism of those toxicities.

TI  - New insights into bisphenols induced obesity in zebrafish (Danio rerio): Activation of cannabinoid receptor CB1.
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - Bisphenols (BPs), as widely used plastic additives, penetrate into our daily lives. BPs are considered endocrine disruptors and could potentially induce obesity. In this study, the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on food intake and lipid metabolism in zebrafish were determined. Moreover, the impact of BPA and TBBPA on the endocannabinoid system (ECS) of zebrafish was further explored by metabolomics, transcriptomics, and molecular docking analysis. Here we show that exposure to BPA and TBBPA at concentrations commonly found in the environment (20, 100, and 500 μg/L) led to hyperphagia and obesity in adult male zebrafish. Metabolomics and histopathological analysis revealed significant lipid accumulation in the liver of zebrafish exposed to BPA and TBBPA. The expression of ECS-related genes, in conjunction with RNA-Seq results, further indicated that BPA and TBBPA increased appetite and induced obesity by activating cannabinoid receptor type 1(CB1). Furthermore, molecular docking revealed that six representative BPs including BPA and TBBPA could bind to the CB1 receptor. Collectively, these findings indicate that CB1 may be a potential target for BPs to induce obesity.

TI  - Evidence-based assessment on environmental mixture using a concentration-dependent transcriptomics approach.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Development of new approach methodologies is urgently needed to characterize the likelihood that complex mixtures of chemicals affect water quality. Omics advances in ecotoxicology allow assessment on a broadest coverage of disrupted biological pathway by mixtures. Here the usefulness of transcriptomic analyses for evaluation of combined effects and identification of main effect components are explored. Two artificial mixtures (Mix 1 and Mix 2) were tested by a concentration-dependent reduced zebrafish transcriptome (CRZT) approach and toxicity bioassays using zebrafish embryos. Then, the toxicities and transcriptomic effects of 12 component chemicals on embryos were incorporated into additivity models to characterize the combined effects of chemicals in mixtures and to identify the main bioactive compounds. Mix 1 and Mix 2 displayed similar embryo toxicities (LD(50): 6.6 μM and 8.7 μM, respectively), however, Mix 2 elicited broader biological process perturbations and 5-fold higher transcriptome potency (point of departure eliciting a 20% pathway response, POD(path20)) than Mix 1. The predicted mixture toxicities derived from additivity expectations deviated by 2-fold or less from the measured embryo toxicities except for the Jaw defect endpoint; most biological processes deviated by 3-fold or less. Finally, diclofenac (DFC) and propiconazole (PCZ) were identified as the main contributing components (≥80% explanation) to the embryo toxicity and biological process perturbations by Mix 1. While DFC and chlorophene (CLP) explained up to 80% of the embryo toxicities and biological effects of Mix 2 associated with development and Metabolism processes. The CRZT approach provides a powerful tool for assessment of biological pathways perturbed by chemicals in mixtures and for identification of main bioactive compounds.

TI  - Tralopyril induces developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryo (Danio rerio) by disrupting the thyroid system and metabolism.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Tralopyril, an antifouling biocide, widely used in antifouling systems to prevent underwater equipment from biological contamination, which can pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms and human health. However, there is little information available on the toxicity of tralopyril to aquatic organisms. Herein, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to investigate the toxicity mechanisms of tralopyril and a series of developmental indicators, thyroid hormones, gene expression and metabolomics were measured. Results showed that tralopyril significantly decreased the heart-beat and body length of zebrafish embryos-larvae exposed to 4.20 μg/L or higher concentrations of tralopyril and also induced developmental defects including pericardial hemorrhage, spine deformation, pericardial edema, tail malformation and uninflated gas bladder. Tralopyril decreased the thyroid hormone concentrations in embryos and changed the transcriptions of the related genes (TRHR, TSHβ, TSHR, Nkx2.1, Dio1, TRα, TRβ, TTR and UGT1ab). Additionally, metabolomics analysis showed that tralopyril affected the metabolism of amino acids, energy and lipids, which was associated with regulation of thyroid system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that alterations of endogenous metabolites induced the thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish following the tralopyril treatment. Therefore, the results showed that tralopyril can induce adverse developmental effects on zebrafish embryos by disrupting the thyroid system and metabolism.

TI  - The specification of zebrafish (Danio rerio) heart electrocardiogram index characteristic responses to different types of pollutants.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Water quality was highly affected by common pollutants. Metals, pesticides and small molecules are ubiquitous pollutants. Advancement in engineering technology (computer-based monitoring systems) increased the efficiency of quantifying toxicity of different chemicals in an organism. The cardiovascular system reflects internal and external stress of an organism, and electrocardiogram (ECG) data reliably measure external stress. As ECG data can accurately reflect the physiological conditions of organisms, and zebrafish (Danio rerio) are considered to be good models for cardiovascular research, it is hypothesized that ECG parameters of zebrafish could indicate the toxicity of water-borne chemicals. To achieve this, we treated zebrafish with different concentrations of target chemicals (CuSO(4), C(10)H(19)O(6)PS(2) and NH(4)Cl) for 48 h and ECG data were measured. P-wave, R-wave, T-wave, PR-interval, QRS-complex and QT-interval data were the focus of this study. The results of self-organizing maps and Pearson correlation analysis indicate that the QRS-complex can be used as an indicator for CuSO(4) stress. The QT-interval could be used to assess the C(10)H(19)O(6)PS(2) stress. The QT-interval and P-wave can be used to evaluate the NH(4)Cl stress. Responses of zebrafish ECG parameters were identical with other vertebrate model, and were specific to toxicant types. It is proved that zebrafish heart ECG index could be used as a potential indicator in early detection of environmental stress.

TI  - Effects of glyphosate on early life stages: comparison between Cyprinus carpio and Danio rerio.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is an active substance of many herbicides. According to literature studies, glyphosate residues and their metabolites have been commonly detected in surface waters and toxicological reports confirmed negative effects on living organisms. In this study, the acute embryo toxicity of glyphosate into two different fish species-common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)-was investigated. Lethal endpoints, development disorder, and, in addition, other sublethal endpoints such as hatching rate, formation of somites, and development of eyes, spontaneous movement, heartbeat/blood circulation, pigmentation, and edema were recorded to indicate the mode of action of the toxic compound. Hatching retardation (p \textless 0.05) was observed in experimental groups of common carp exposed to glyphosate with significant statistical difference especially at the highest concentration after 72, 96, and 120 hpf. The significantly highest cumulative mortality at concentration of 50 mg/l was observed. In contrast, hatching stimulation was observed in embryos of zebrafish exposed to the highest concentration of glyphosate. The significantly highest cumulative mortality for zebrafish was observed only at concentration of 50 mg/l. Based on our results, early life stages of common carp are more sensitive in comparison to zebrafish to the toxic action of glyphosate.

TI  - Effects of miR-181a-5p abnormal expression on zebrafish (Danio rerio) vascular development following triclosan exposure.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Triclosan (TCS), one of the important bactericides, is widely used in personal care products, and its chronic exposure leads to severe toxic effects on the growth and development of blood vessels in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Herein, we screened out three differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-181a-5p, miR-132-3p and miR-128-3p) by sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses of 4-96-hpf TCS-exposed zebrafish, among which miR-181a-5p was found to regulate many signaling pathways involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and phosphatidylimositol signaling systems. By O-dianisidine staining, TCS-exposure resulted in decreased distribution of red blood cells and induced blood hypercoagulable state and thrombotic effects. Defective subintestinal veins (SIVs), and decreased branching and curvature of blood vessels were observed with increasing TCS-exposure concentrations. After microinjection of miR-181a-5p mimic and inhibitor, zebrafish malformation type and percentage were prominently increased such as distorted SIV vessels along with reduced venation and abnormal branches by ALP staining. Overexpressed miR-181a-5p had a greater effect on development and branching patterns of arteries and veins than its knockdown. By laser confocal microscopy observation, the 72-hpf Tg (flk1: mCherry) zebrafish obviously displayed vascular proliferation and ablation in the miR-181a-5p mimic group. Microinjection of miR-181a-5p mimics and inhibitors led to abnormal expressions (20-50%) of two key target genes (pax2a and vash2) by WISH, and increased malformation percentages (18-45%) by IOD analysis. Overexpression of vash2 led to the inhibitory or promoting effects on the expression of PI3K signaling pathway-related genes, proving that the effect of vash2 on development of blood vessels could be realized by inhibiting PI3K signaling pathway. These observations lay theoretical foundation for deep insight into the molecular mechanisms on TCS-induced cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Exposure to pyrimethanil induces developmental toxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Pyrimethanil is a broad-spectrum fungicide commonly used in the prevention and treatment of Botrytis cinerea. However, little information is available in the literature to show the toxicity of Pyrimethanil to cardiac development. In this study, we used an experimental animal model to explore the developmental and cardiac toxicity of Pyrimethanil in aquatic vertebrates; we exposed zebrafish embryos to Pyrimethanil at concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 mg/L from 5.5 to 72 h post fertilisation. We found that Pyrimethanil caused a decrease in the hatching rate, heart rate, and survival rate of zebrafish embryos. Pyrimethanil exposure also resulted in pericardial and yolk sac edema, spinal deformity, and heart loop failure. Moreover, Pyrimethanil increased reactive oxygen stress levels and heightened the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Alterations were induced in the transcription of apoptosis-related genes (p53, Bax, Bcl2, Casp 9, and Casp6l1) and heart development-related genes (Tbx2b, Gata4, Myh6, Vmhc, Nppa, Bmp2b, Bpm 4, and Bpm 10). Our data showed that the activation of Wnt signalling by BML-284 could partially rescue the malformed phenotype caused by Pyrimethanil. Our results provide new evidence for Pyrimethanil's toxicity and the danger of its residues in the environment and agricultural products.

TI  - Effects of pH and nitrites on the toxicity of a cypermethrin-based pesticide to zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Physical and chemical water parameters have an important role on the toxicity of environmental contaminants by affecting their degradation, transformation and bioavailability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of pH and nitrite variation on the toxicity of the cypermethrin based pesticide Barrage®. Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were exposed to a combination of pH or nitrite and cypermethrin through the Barrage® formulation for 96 h and lethal and developmental endpoints assessed. Concerning mortality, pH seemed to increase Barrage® toxicity, while nitrite concentrations tested did not seem to change Barrage® lethality. At sublethal level, either for combinations involving pH or nitrites, results suggested some interactive effects of environmental and chemical factors, highlighting the need of further research. This work suggests that sublethal endpoints should be included in the assessment of combined effects of compounds given that they can provide important information not obtained through lethality.

TI  - Effect of Propiconazole on the Lipid Metabolism of Zebrafish Embryos ( Danio rerio).
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that has been widely used in agriculture and has been detected in the aquatic environment. This study aimed to investigate the effects of propiconazole exposure on lipid metabolism in the early life stages of zebrafish for 120 h postfertilization (hpf). Using the early life stages of zebrafish to address scientific questions is lower in cost, more efficient, and suitable to meeting current legislation than those in other traditional fish species. Exposure to propiconazole significantly inhibited the development of zebrafish embryos and larvae. This exposure also caused reduced locomotor activities in zebrafish. Furthermore, total cholesterol levels, lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid synthase activities were significantly decreased. The expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism were significantly up-regulated in response to propiconazole exposure. GC-MS/MS analysis revealed that fatty acids were significantly decreased. Together, the findings indicate the potential environmental risks of propiconazole exposure in the aquatic ecosystem.

TI  - Mitochondrial response and resilience to anthropogenic chemicals during embryonic development.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Mitochondria are integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Optimum mitochondrial function is critical during embryonic development, as they play a key role in early signaling cascades and epigenetic programming, in addition to sustaining an adequate energy production. Mitochondria are sensitive targets of environmental toxins, potentially even at levels considered safe under current regulatory limits. Most mitochondrial analyses have focused only on chemical exposure effects in vitro or in isolated mitochondria. However, comparatively little is known about mitochondrial effects of chemical exposure during vertebrate embryogenesis, especially during the recovery phase following a chemical insult. Here, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio), in a 96-well plate system, to examine mitochondrial effects of 24 chemicals including pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and agrochemicals. We used oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during embryogenesis as a proxy for mitochondrial function. Embryonic OCR (eOCR) was measured in clean egg water immediately following 24 h of chemical exposure and subsequently for an additional 8 h. Each chemical, dependent upon the concentration, resulted in a unique eOCR response profile. While some eOCR effects were persistent or recoverable over time, some effects were only detected several hours after being removed from the exposure. Non-monotonic dose response effects as well as mitochondrial hormesis were also detected following exposure to some chemicals. Collectively, our study shows that mitochondrial response to chemicals are highly dynamic and warrant careful consideration when determining mitochondrial toxicity of a given chemical.

TI  - QSAR models for the acute toxicity of 1,2,4-triazole fungicides to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - In recent decades, the 1,2,4-triazole fungicides are widely used for crop diseases control, and their toxicity to wild lives and pollution to ecosystem have attracted more and more attention. However, how to quickly and efficiently evaluate the toxicity of these compounds to environmental organisms is still a challenge. In silico method, such like Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), provides a good alternative to evaluate the environmental toxicity of a large number of chemicals. At the present study, the acute toxicity of 23 1,2,4-triazole fungicides to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos was firstly tested, and the LC(50) (median lethal concentration) values were used as the bio-activity endpoint to conduct QSAR modelling for these triazoles. After the comparative study of several QSAR models, the 2D-QSAR model was finally constructed using the stepwise multiple linear regression algorithm combining with two physicochemical parameters (logD and μ), an electronic parameter (Q(N1)) and a topological parameter (X(v)PC(4)). The optimal model could be mathematically described as following: pLC(50) = -7.24-0.30X(v)PC(4) + 0.76logD - 26.15Q(N1) - 0.08μ. The internal validation by leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation showed that the R(2)(adj) (adjusted noncross-validation squared correlation coefficient), Q(2) (cross-validation correlation coefficient) and RMSD (root-mean-square error) was 0.88, 0.84 and 0.17, respectively. The external validation indicated the model had a robust predictability with the q(2) (predictive squared correlation coefficient) of 0.90 when eliminated tricyclazole. The present study provided a potential tool for predicting the acute toxicity of new 1,2,4-triazole fungicides which contained an independent triazole ring group in their molecules to zebrafish embryos, and also provided a reference for the development of more environmentally-friendly 1,2,4-triazole pesticides in the future.

TI  - Isolation of the Tephrosia vogelii extract and rotenoids and their toxicity in the RTgill-W1 trout cell line and in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology
AB  - This study focused on identifying the rotenoids from the Tephrosia vogelli plant (fish-poison-bean), investigating the toxic potency of a crude T. vogelii extract and individual rotenoids (tephrosin, deguelin and rotenone) in vitro and in vivo and assessing the mode of action. A trout (Onychorynhis mykiss) gill epithelial cell line (RTgill-W1) was used to determine the cytotoxicity of rotenoids and effects on cell metabolism. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) aged from 3 h post fertilization (hpf) to 72 hpf were used for testing the developmental toxicity. The crude T. vogelii plant extract significantly decreased the cellular metabolic activity and was cytotoxic at lower concentrations (5 and 10 nM, respectively), while tephrosin, deguelin and rotenone showed these effects at concentrations ≥ 50 nM. The crude T. Vogelli extract had the highest toxic potency and induced adverse health effects in zebrafish including deformities and mortality at the lowest concentration (5 nM) compared to rotenone (10 nM) and deguelin and tephrosin (50 nM). These results indicate that the crude T. Vogelii extracts are highly potent and the bioactivity of these extracts warrant further investigation for their potential use to treat parasites in human and veterinary medicine and as a natural alternative to pesticides.

TI  - Combined toxicity assessment of myclobutanil and thiamethoxam to zebrafish embryos employing multi-endpoints.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - It is necessary to understand the interactions between different pesticides in ecotoxicology because pesticides never appear as individual compounds but rather in combinations with other compounds. In this study, we planned to explicate the combined toxic effect of myclobutanil (MYC) and thiamethoxam (THI) on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) by adopting multiple biomarkers. Results unraveled that the 96-h LC(50) values of MYC to D. rerio at various life phases ranged from 5.2 to 10.3 mg L(-1), which were lower than those of THI ranging from 147 to 246 mg L(-1). Combinations of MYC and THI exhibited synergetic toxicity to zebrafish embryos. The activities of antioxidative enzymes (T-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD) and detoxification enzyme (GST) were obviously varied in most of the MYC, THI and combined exposures compared to the control. The mRNA expressions of eight genes (Cu-sod, cas3, il-8, cxcl, erα, crh, cyp17 and dio1) involved in antioxidation, apoptosis, immunity and endocrine were obviously altered in the combined exposure of MYC and THI compared to their individual exposures. Our findings hinted the threats when YMC and THI co-existed, which would be beneficial for the risk assessments of pesticide mixtures.

TI  - Zebrafish as a model for acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorus agent exposure and oxime reactivation.
T2  - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
AB  - The current research progression efforts for investigating novel treatments for exposure to organophosphorus (OP) compounds that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), including pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs), rely solely on in vitro cell assays and in vivo rodent models. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular, well-established vertebrate model in biomedical research that offers high-throughput capabilities and genetic manipulation not readily available with rodents. A number of research studies have investigated the effects of subacute developmental exposure to OP pesticides in zebrafish, observing detrimental effects on gross morphology, neuronal development, and behavior. Few studies, however, have utilized this model to evaluate treatments, such as oxime reactivators, anticholinergics, or anticonvulsants, following acute exposure. Preliminary work has investigated the effects of CWNA exposure. The results clearly demonstrated relative toxicity and oxime efficacy similar to that reported for the rodent model. This review surveys the current literature utilizing zebrafish as a model for OP exposure and highlights its potential use as a high-throughput system for evaluating AChE reactivator antidotal treatments to acute pesticide and CWNA exposure.

TI  - Effects of phthalate acid esters on zebrafish larvae: Development and skeletal morphogenesis.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - This study evaluated the acute developmental toxicity of six priority phthalic acid esters (PAEs) including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) in zebrafish embryos. A novel alcian blue and alizarin red double staining was performed to detect skeletal development of zebrafish larvae. Results revealed that all six PAEs could induce different developmental abnormalities in zebrafish larvae, including abnormal movement, decreased heart rate, spinal curvature, and pericardial edema. The bone development of zebrafish larvae exposed to PAEs was also affected by PAEs acute exposure. Among PAEs, DBP, and BBP even at low doses can cause mortality in zebrafish, implying their higher toxicity. Contrarily, DEHP and DNOP showed minor effects on the developmental morphology of zebrafish larvae. However, the gene expression levels of skeleton-related genes showed the upregulation of the runx2b and shha genes after DEHP and DBP exposure. Taken together, the strict use and release of PAEs in the environment should be supervised by the government for ecological and environmental safety.

TI  - Developmental Exposure to PCB153 (2,2',4,4',5,5'-Hexachlorobiphenyl) Alters Circadian Rhythms and the Expression of Clock and Metabolic Genes.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are highly persistent and ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutants. Based on their chemical structure, PCBs are classified into non-ortho-substituted and ortho-substituted congeners. Non-ortho-substituted PCBs are structurally similar to dioxin and their toxic effects and mode of action are well-established. In contrast, very little is known about the effects of ortho-substituted PCBs, particularly, during early development. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of exposure to an environmentally prominent ortho-substituted PCB (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl; PCB153) on zebrafish embryos. We exposed zebrafish embryos to 3 different concentrations of PCB153 starting from 4 to 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf). We quantified gross morphological changes, behavioral phenotypes, gene expression changes, and circadian behavior in the larvae. There were no developmental defects during the exposure period, but starting at 7 dpf, we observed spinal deformity in the 10 μM PCB153 treated group. A total of 633, 2227, and 3378 differentially expressed genes were observed in 0.1 μM (0.036 μg/ml), 1 μM (0.36 μg/ml), and 10 μM (3.6 μg/ml) PCB153-treated embryos, respectively. Of these, 301 genes were common to all treatment groups. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes related to circadian rhythm, FoxO signaling, and insulin resistance pathways. Behavioral analysis revealed that PCB153 exposure significantly alters circadian behavior. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with the development of metabolic and neurological diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental chemicals in disrupting metabolism and other physiological processes is essential.

TI  - Fluoxastrobin-induced effects on acute toxicity, development toxicity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage in Danio rerio embryos.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Strobilurin fungicides (SFs), the most commonly used fungicides, pose threats for controlling fungal diseases. The fungicides were monitored in aquatic ecosystems and may have negative effects on nontarget organisms. This project was undertaken to monitor the toxic effects of fluoxastrobin (FLUO) on Danio rerio embryos and to evaluate the SF risks in aquatic ecosystems. The 96-hour median lethal concentration (96 h LC(50)), hatching rates, and morphological abnormalities were used to analyze acute toxicity and teratogenicity of FLUO to Danio rerio embryos at an FLUO dose of 0.549 mg/L (95% confidence limits: 0.423 to 0.698 mg/L); the results showed that FLUO has high toxicity in embryos that is analogous to the toxicity observed in adult Danio rerio. Fluoxastrobin may lead embryos to delayed hatching at concentrations \textgreater0.6 mg/L, and it may lead to teratogenicity (i.e., pericardial edema and spinal curvature). Based on the 96 h LC(50) results, the following parameters were evaluated in Danio rerio: development-related indicators (body length and heart rates), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, the levels of three antioxidants, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and apoptosis. The results elucidated that FLUO inhibition of spinal and heart development may be induced by oxidative stress. In addition, FLUO induced a notable climb in ROS content, LPO, the activated activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and it inhibited glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity. Fluoxastrobin led to DNA damage (i.e., a notable climb of 8-OHdG contents and apoptotic cells). Collectively, FLUO posed threats to Danio rerio embryos at multiple levels, and this investigation could be a reminder for people to be more judicious in SF-use to avoid or relieve SF toxicity to nontarget organisms.

TI  - Developmental and metabolic responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae to short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) exposure.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are highly toxic to aquatic organisms, but their toxicity is yet not well characterized. In this study, the developmental toxicity of SCCPs to zebrafish embryos/larvae was evaluated, and a metabolomics approach was adopted to explore the impact of SCCPs exposure on the metabolism in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to SCCPs at concentrations of 1-200μg/L did not produce an observable effect on the hatching rate and morphological deformities of zebrafish embryos/larvae. However, the survival rate of zebrafish larvae in SCCPs exposure groups decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The 13-day 50% lethal concentration (LC(50)) value of SCCPs was calculated to be 34.4μg/L. Exposure to SCCPs induced a significant change of overall metabolism, even at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-5μg/L). The most relevant pathways affected by SCCPs exposure were glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and purine metabolism. Exposure to SCCPs at concentrations of 1-5μg/L had begun to accelerate the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and very long chain fatty acids, and affect the transformation of guanine to xanthine in the pathway of purine metabolism. Furthermore, when the exposure concentrations of SCCPs were increased to 50-200μg/L, the levels of phospholipids and amino acids were significantly raised; whereas the levels of fatty acids, carnitines and inosine were significantly decreased. In view of the significant effect on metabolism, the sub-chronic and chronic toxicity of SCCPs to fish should be concerned.

TI  - Crosstalk of cholinergic pathway on thyroid disrupting effects of the insecticide chlorpyrifos in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Chlorpyrifos is a widely used organophosphate insecticide and ubiquitously detected in the environment. However, little attention has been paid to its endocrine disrupting effect to non-target organisms. In the present study, zebrafish was exposed to 13 and 65 μg/L of chlorpyrifos for 7 and 10 days to determine the induced neurotoxicity and the alteration of thyroid metabolism. The 120 h LC(50) and LC(10) of chlorpyrifos was estimated as 1.35 mg/L and 0.62 mg/L based on the acute embryo toxicity assay, respectively. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory was detected by 13 μg/L chlorpyrifos and could be reversed by the co-exposure of 100 and 1000 μg/L anticholinergic agent atropine. For thyroid hormone level, 13 and 65 μg/L of chlorpyrifos induced increased free T(3) levels in 10 dpf (days post-fertilization). The expression of thyroid related genes in 7 and 10 dpf exposed zebrafish were measured by the quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. The mRNA expression of tshba, thrb, crhb, ttr, tpo, ugt1ab and slc5a5 had significant change. However, the alterations of thyroid hormone and mRNA expression could be partly rescued by the addition of atropine. The molecular docking of chlorpyrifos and T(3) to the thyroid receptor β in zebrafish using homology modelling and CDOCKER procedures shown weaker binding ability of chlorpyrifos compared to T(3). Therefore, we concluded that the disturbance of thyroid signaling in zebrafish might arise from the developmental neurotoxicity induced by chlorpyrifos.

AB  - Triazole fungicides are extensively applied in general agriculture for fungal control and have negative impacts on aquatic organisms. Prothioconazole, a widely used triazole fungicide, is toxic to zebrafish, but systematic research on the negative effects caused by prothioconazole in zebrafish embryos is limited. In this study, we studied the developmental toxicology, oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by prothioconazole in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to 0.850 mg/L prothioconazole impacts embryo survival and hatching. Prothioconazole exposure caused embryo malformation, especially yolk-sac and pericardial edemas, and prothioconazole-induced apoptosis was observed. Additionally, exposure to a high prothioconazole concentration up-regulated the expression levels of oxidative stress defense-related genes and p53. The bax to bcl2 ratio increased along with exposure time and prothioconazole concentration. Prothioconazole induced apoptosis during the early life stages of zebrafish and may trigger oxidative-stress and p53-dependent pathway responses. Our findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress and cell death caused by prothioconazole.

TI  - Life cycle exposure to propiconazole reduces fecundity by disrupting the steroidogenic pathway and altering DNA methylation in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environment international
AB  - Propiconazole is fungicide widely used in agriculture, which may enter aquatic ecosystems and affect organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to environmentally relevant levels of propiconazole throughout the life cycle, from embryo to sexually mature adults, and the effects on growth, reproduction, and offspring viability were investigated. To investigate the mechanisms of propiconazole action, the sex steroid hormones and the expression of genes related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPGL) axis and DNA methylation were examined. Growth decreased in the parental zebrafish (F0) after exposure to propiconazole for 120 days. In males, increases in the levels of 17β-estradiol and vitellogenin were observed. The alterations in sex steroid hormones were regulated by the expression of genes involved with the HPGL axis. The decreases in fecundity and fertilization of the F0 was induced by the global DNA methylation, and then may result in the abnormal development of the F1. Therefore, propiconazole disrupted the steroidogenic pathway and caused changes in global DNA methylation that induced reproductive toxicity.

TI  - Short exposure to glyphosate induces locomotor, craniofacial, and bone disorders in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] is the active ingredient in widely used broad-spectrum herbicides. Even though the toxicity mechanism of this herbicide in vertebrates is poorly understood, evidence suggests that glyphosate is an endocrine disruptor capable of producing morphological anomalies as well as cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects. We used the zebraﬁsh model to assess the effects of early life glyphosate exposure on the development of cartilage and bone tissues and organismal responses. We found functional alterations, including a reduction in the cardiac rate, significant changes in the spontaneous tail movement pattern, and defects in craniofacial development. These effects were concomitant with alterations in the level of the estrogen receptor alpha osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. We also found that embryos exposed to glyphosate presented spine deformities as adults. These developmental alterations are likely induced by changes in protein levels related to bone and cartilage formation.

TI  - Zebrafish: A Model for the Study of Toxicants Affecting Muscle Development and Function.
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - The rapid progress in medicine, agriculture, and allied sciences has enabled the development of a large amount of potentially useful bioactive compounds, such as drugs and pesticides. However, there is another side of this phenomenon, which includes side effects and environmental pollution. To avoid or minimize the uncontrollable consequences of using the newly developed compounds, researchers seek a quick and effective means of their evaluation. In achieving this goal, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has proven to be a highly useful tool, mostly because of its fast growth and development, as well as the ability to absorb the molecules diluted in water through its skin and gills. In this review, we focus on the reports concerning the application of zebrafish as a model for assessing the impact of toxicants on skeletal muscles, which share many structural and functional similarities among vertebrates, including zebrafish and humans.

TI  - Effects of new antiseizure drugs on seizure activity and anxiety-like behavior in adult zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicology and applied pharmacology
AB  - Several studies with larvae and adult zebrafish have shown that old and new antiseizure drugs (ASDs) produce discrepant results in seizure tests, locomotor activity or anxiety models. In this study, the pentylenetetrazole seizure test (PTZ) was performed to assess the effectiveness of four new ASDs: lamotrigine (LTG), topiramate (TPM), felbamate (FBM), and levetiracetam (LEV) in the subsequent stages of seizures in adult fish. All ASDs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). The time of maximal anticonvulsant effect and the dose-response relationship of the drugs were assessed. The effects of studied ASDs on the locomotor activity and the anxiety-like behavior in the color preference test were also investigated. Furthermore, drug concentrations in zebrafish homogenates were determined. LTG, TPM, and LEV significantly increased the seizure latency at three subsequent stages of seizures (SI-SIII), while FBM was effective only at SI. Locomotor activity decreased after TPM treatment. TPM and FBM exhibited a strong anxiolytic-like effect in the color preference test. LEV at the highest dose tested had a weak anxiolytic-like effect. The HPLC analysis showed average concentrations of the studied ASDs in the fish body during their maximum anticonvulsant activity. The present study shows that FBM cannot inhibit all subsequent PTZ seizure stages in the adult fish. Except for LTG, the studied drugs affected the anxiety-like behavior of treated animals. Furthermore, only TPM significantly changed locomotion parameters. Our findings support the need to accurately characterize the efficacy of new ASDs at different stages of the PTZ-induced seizures in adult zebrafish.

TI  - Bifenazate exposure induces cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Bifenazate is a novel acaricide for selective foliar spraying and is widely used to control mites in agricultural production. However, its toxicity to aquatic organisms is unknown. Here, a zebrafish model was used to study bifenazate toxicity to aquatic organisms. Exposure to bifenazate was found to cause severe cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, along with disorders in the gene expression related to heart development. Bifenazate also caused oxidative stress. Cardiotoxicity caused by bifenazate was partially rescued by astaxanthin (an antioxidant), accompanied by cardiac genes and oxidative stress-related indicators becoming normalized. Our results showed that exposure to bifenazate can significantly change the ATPase activity and gene expression levels of the calcium signaling pathway. These led to heart failure, in which the blood accumulated outside the heart without entering it, eventually leading to death. The results indicated that bifenazate exposure caused cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos through the induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of the calcium signaling pathway.

TI  - Developmental circulatory failure caused by metabolites of organophosphorus flame retardants in zebrafish, Danio rerio.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Organophosphate triesters are used worldwide as additives in flame retardants and plasticizer as a replacement of polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Increasing evidence on human exposure to and environmental contamination with organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) requires an adequate toxicity assessment for this class of chemicals. While developmental toxicity of several OPFRs has been reported, developmental effects of OPFR metabolites have still to be understood. The present study aimed at characterizing developmental effects of OPFR metabolites using zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and two of its metabolites, 3-hydroxylphenyl diphenyl phosphate and 4-hydroxylphenyl diphenyl phosphate, were most potent for inducing pericardial edema and reduction in blood flow in trunk vessels. Other TPHP metabolites, such as diphenyl phosphate and 4-hydroxylphenyl phenyl phosphate, showed no substantial increase in circulatory failure at concentrations up to 30 μM. Tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate showed circulatory failure at 30 μM, but its metabolite bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate did not. Neither tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate nor its metabolite bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, induced circulatory failure. The circulatory failure appeared to be enhanced with the increase in the octanol-water partition coefficients of OPFRs and their metabolites, suggesting that developmental circulatory failure posed by these chemicals could be estimated by their bioaccumulative potential. The present study demonstrated developmental circulatory failure of hydroxylated TPHP metabolites, which was almost equipotent to TPHP. Diester OPFR metabolites showed no major developmental toxicity at the concentrations used in this study. The current results establish the foundation for further understanding the similarities and differences in the toxic mechanisms between OPFRs and their metabolites.

TI  - Simultaneous degradation of triazophos, methamidophos and carbofuran pesticides in wastewater using an Enterobacter bacterial bioreactor and analysis of toxicity and biosafety.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Triazophos (TAP), methamidophos (MAP) and carbofuran (CF) pesticides are highly toxic, soluble and absorbable. Efficient co-degradation of multi-pesticides is rare reported. The objectives of this study were to investigate TAP, MAP and CF co-degradative ability of Enterobacter sp. Z1 and study the degradation mechanisms. Strain Z1 was shown to efficiently co-degrade TAP, MAP and CF when they were used as primary carbon sources. The degradation occurred over a wide range of temperatures, pH values and pesticide concentrations and followed first-order kinetics. Under the optimum conditions (37 °C, pH 7 and 100 mg/L of each pesticide), the degradation efficiencies were 100%, 100%, and 95.3% for TAP, MAP and CF, respectively. In addition, strain Z1 could simultaneously degrade TAP, MAP, CF and total nitrogen in wastewater in a batch bioreactor, with high removal efficiencies of 98.3%, 100%, 98.7% and 100%, respectively. Genomics, proteomics, qRT-PCR and gene overexpression analyses revealed that the degradation mechanisms involved the activities of multiple proteins, among which, organophosphorus hydrolase (Oph) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PaaC) are primarily responsible for TAP and MAP degradation, while carbofuran hydrolase (Mcd) and amidohydrolase (RamA) primarily degrade CF. Among these enzymes, PaaC and RamA are newly identified pesticide-degrading enzymes. Toxicity assays of strain Z1 using reporter recombinase gene (recA) and zebrafish showed that there was no accumulation of toxic metabolites during the degradation process. Biosafety test using zebrafish showed that the strain was nontoxic toward zebrafish. Strain Z1 provides a good purification effect for pesticides-containing wastewater and novel microbial pesticide-degrading mechanisms were discovered.

TI  - miR-137 and miR-141 regulate tail defects in zebrafish embryos caused by triphenyl phosphate (TPHP).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Exposure to triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), an organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), caused developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. However, the underlying molecular mechanism at the epigenetic level is largely unknown. Based on developmental toxicity (i.e., mortality and malformation), we measured expression levels of mRNA genes and their targeted miRNA in zebrafish embryos exposed to TPHP. As a result, TPHP caused developmental delay beginning at the 17-somite stage linking to detrimental effects in the tail and even embryonic mortality. Abnormal tail development was found to be associated with down-regulation of mmp9 and sox9b in both qRT-PCR and whole in-situ hybridization analysis. Also, we identified two microRNAs (i.e., miR-137 and miR-141) and observed their differential over-expression in TPHP-exposed zebrafish embryos. In the microinjection of miR-137 and miR-141 inhibitors, the reduced expression of mmp9 and sox9b upon TPHP exposure was compensated, indicating that epigenetic deregulation of miRNAs modulated putative genes involved in phenotypic tail defects triggered by TPHP in developing zebrafish embryos. This study provides insight for future mechanistic research using teleost fish on function of miRNAs in environmental toxicology.

TI  - Identification of apoptosis and macrophage migration events in paraquat-induced oxidative stress using a zebrafish model.
T2  - Life sciences
AB  - AIMS: Paraquat (PQ) is a pesticide highly toxic to human beings, and a well-known trigger of oxidative stress. Although several animal models of PQ poisoning have been developed, some disadvantages limit their application in vivo. A zebrafish model was used in the present study to better define mechanisms of oxidative stress injury induced by PQ. MAIN METHODS: The toxicity of PQ was evaluated in the AB strain of zebrafish, and apoptosis was assessed by acridine orange staining. Macrophage migration was identified using the TG (zlyz:EGFP) transgenic strain, and angiogenesis was observed using the fli1a-EGFP casper strain. Following the validation of gene changes by zebrafish-based in vivo quantitative real-time PCR, network analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. KEY FINDINGS: We first established the LC50 of PQ in the zebrafish model, and then found that robust oxidative stress and antioxidant genes were activated after PQ exposure. Moreover, apoptosis and distinct macrophage activation and migration were identified for the first time in PQ-exposed zebrafish. Utilizing this model, both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways involved in PQ-induced apoptosis were elucidated. We further demonstrated that macrophage migration was specifically induced by PQ, and that Rho family members and JNK-MMP13 signaling participated in this process. SIGNIFICANCE: Zebrafish is a promising tool for investigating the mechanisms of oxidative stress injury induced by PQ, and for screening effective anti-oxidant drugs.

TI  - Elucidating the molecular interaction of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 with diaminopimelic acid and lysine type peptidoglycans using in silico approaches.
T2  - Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) belong to the family of pattern recognition receptor, represent the major constituent of innate immunity. Although PGRPs are structurally conserved through evolution, their involvement in innate immunity is different in vertebrates and invertebrates. They are highly specific towards recognition of ligands and can hydrolyze bacterial peptidoglycans (PGNs). Zebrafish PGRPs (zPGRPs) have both peptidoglycans lytic amidase activity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity, but far less is known about how these receptors recognize these microbial ligands. Such studies are hindered due to lack of structural and functional configuration of zPGRPs. Therefore, in this study, we predicted the three-dimensional structure of zPGRP2 through theoretical modeling, investigated the conformational and dynamic properties through molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular docking study revealed the microbial ligands, that is, muramyl pentapeptide-DAP , muramyl pentapeptide-LYS, muramyl tripeptide-DAP, muramyl tripeptide-Lys, muramyl tetrapeptide-DAP, muramyl tetrapeptide-LYS and tracheal cytotoxin interacts with the conserved amino acids of the ligand recognition site comprised of β1, α2, α4, β4 and loops connecting β1 - α2, α2 - β2, β3 - β4 and α4 - α5. Conserved His31, His32, Ala34, Ile35, Pro36, Lys38, Asp60, Trp61, Trp63, Ala89, His90, Asp106, His143 and Arg144 are predicted to essential for binding and provides stability to these zPGRP-PGN complexes. Our study provides basic molecular information for further research on the immune mechanisms of PGRP's in Zebrafish. The plasticity of the zPGRP's binding site revealed by these microbial ligands suggests an intrinsic capacity of the innate immune system to rapidly evolve specificities to meet new microbial challenges in the future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Interaction of insecticides with heteromeric GABA-gated chloride channels from zebrafish Danio rerio (Hamilton).
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - The ionotropic GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) is the main fast inhibitory post-synaptic receptor and is also an important insecticidal target. Effect of insecticides on fish has attracted intensive attention. However, no systematic study on heteromeric zebrafish GABA(A)R expressed in oocytes has been reported to date. In this study, the α1 subunit, the β2S subunit lacking 47 amino acid residues compared with the β2L subunit, and the γ2 subunit having five transmembrane domains were isolated from zebrafish Danio rerio. The responses of homomeric and heteromeric (α1, β2S and γ2) channels to agonists and GABA(A)R-targeted compounds were detected with two-electrode voltage clamp. Dose-dependent responses were observed in heteromeric α1β2S, β2Sγ2, and α1β2Sγ2 GABAR channels with EC(50) values at 21.75, 6291, and 33.69 μM for GABA-induced current and 3.28, 155.5, and 3.79 mM for β-alanine-induced current, respectively. However, no response was induced by benzamidine in all GABAR channels. Abamectin, dieldrin, fluralaner and fipronil could strongly inhibited GABA-induced inward current ≥50% at 10(-6) M, while α-endosulfan, flufiprole and ethiprole only inhibited GABA-induced current \textless50%. This study has clarified the interaction of insecticides with the heteromeric GABA(A)R channel, which could help us further explore the potential function and toxicological importance of GABA(A)Rs from D. rerio.

T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) and pesticides are two kinds of ubiquitous pollutants that can pose a health risk to aquatic organisms. However, researches about the combined effects of MPs and pesticides are very limited. A simple combined exposure model was established in this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to 100 μg/L imidacloprid (IMI), 20 μg/L polystyrene microplastics (PS), and a combination of PS and IMI (PS + IMI) for 21 days. The results demonstrated that exposure to PS and IMI inhibited the growth of zebrafish and altered the levels of glycolipid metabolism and oxidative stress-related biochemical parameters. While gene expression analysis revealed that, compared with PS or IMI treatment group, combined exposure caused a greater change in gene expression levels involving the process of glycolipid metabolism (Gk, Hk1, Aco, PPar-α, Cpt1, Acc, Fas, PPar-γ, Apo) and inflammatory response (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-10). The results demonstrated that even combined exposure of low concentrations of PS and IMI could cause more severe hepatotoxicity in zebrafish, especially in terms of gene transcription. And more combined toxicity studies are essential for MPs and pesticides risk assessment.

TI  - Acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination, action mode and detoxification metabolism of broflanilide in zebrafish, Danio rerio.
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - Broflanilide, a novel meta-diamide insecticide, shows high insecticidal activity against agricultural pests and is scheduled to be launched onto the market in 2020. However, little information about its potential toxicological effects on fish has been reported. In this study, broflanilide showed low toxicity to the zebrafish, Danio rerio, with LC(50) \textgreater 10 mg L(-1) at 96 h and also did not inhibit GABA-induced currents of the heteromeric Drα1β2Sγ2 GABA receptor. Broflanilide showed medium bioconcentration level with a bioconcentration factor at steady state (BCF(ss)) of 10.02 and 69.40 in D. rerio at 2.00 mg L(-1) and 0.20 mg L(-1), respectively. In the elimination process, the concentration of broflanilide rapidly decreased within two days and slowly dropped below the limit of quantification after ten days. In the 2.00 mg L(-1) broflanilide treatment, CYP450 activity was significantly increased up to 3.11-fold during eight days. Glutathione-S- transferase (GST) activity significantly increased by 91.44 % within four days. In conclusion, the acute toxicity of broflanilide was low, but it might induce chronic toxicity, affecting metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the toxicological effects of broflanilide on an aquatic organism, which has the potential to guide the use of broflanilide in the field.

TI  - Pyriproxyfen induced impairment of reproductive endocrine homeostasis and gonadal histopathology in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by altered expression of hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis genes.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Pyriproxyfen (PPF), a broad-spectrum insecticide known to cause reproductive and endocrine disruption in invertebrates, while the data is scarce in aquatic vertebrates. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of PPF on reproductive endocrine system of male and female zebrafish along hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In brain, PPF caused significant alteration in the transcripts of erα, lhβ, and cyp19b genes in male and fshβ, lhβ, and cyp19b genes in female zebrafish. The downstream genes of steroidogenic pathway like, star, 3βhsd, 17βhsd, and cyp19a expression were significantly altered in gonad of both sexes. Subsequent changes in circulatory steroid hormone levels lead to imbalance in hormone homeostasis as revealed from estradiol/testosterone (E(2)/T) ratio. Further, the vitellogenin transcript level was enhanced in hepatic tissues and their blood plasma content was increased in male (16.21%) and declined in female (21.69%). PPF also induced histopathological changes in gonads such as, reduction of mature spermatocytes in male and vitellogenic oocytes in female zebrafish. The altered E(2)/T ratio and gonadal histopathology were supported by the altered transcript levels of HPG axis genes. Overall, these findings provide new insights of PPF in zebrafish reproductive system and highlights for further investigations on its potential risks in aquatic environment.

TI  - Mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and transcriptomic alterations induced by four strobilurins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) early life stages.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Though the toxicity of strobilurins on non-target aquatic organisms has been characterized, the associated toxic mechanisms have not been fully explored. The present study showed that the larval stage was the most sensitive developmental stage in zebrafish, and pyraclostrobin (PY) had the highest acute toxicity to embryos, larvae, juvenile and adult with 96 h-LC(50) at 0.048 mg/L, 0.029 mg/L, 0.039 mg/L, 0.031 mg/L respectively, when compared with the toxicity of trifloxystrobin (TR), kresoxim-methyl (KM) and azoxystrobin (AZ) at corresponding developmental stage. Then we investigated the transcriptomics and developmental toxicity of TR, KM, AZ and PY on zebrafish embryos after 72 h exposure. RNA-seq revealed that the pathways related to cell apoptosis and cancer, and cellular components organelle membrane and mitochondrion, were markedly affected after TR, KM, AZ and PY exposure during zebrafish early life stages. The results were further confirmed by the induction of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, the elevation of H(2)O(2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, as well as the reduction of intracellular calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which indicated that strobilurins could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. The present study was performed a systematic analysis of strobilurins to zebrafish at multi-levels, which provided suggestions for further investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity induced by strobilurins on aquatic organisms.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of FireMaster 550® in zebrafish (Danio rerio): Chronic developmental and acute adolescent exposures.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - BACKGROUND: FireMaster® 550 (FM 550) is the second most commonly used flame retardant (FR) product in consumer goods and has been detected in household dust samples. However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied. In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during adolescence in zebrafish were studied. METHODS: Developmental exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization, with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion, for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank water with .0004% (developmental) or .0012% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation, sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration. RESULTS: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a significant (p\textless0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM 550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior (p's\textless0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point DISCUSSION: Taken together, these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute adolescent exposure.

TI  - Computational and experimental investigations on the interactions of aryloxy-phenoxy-propionate herbicides to estrogen receptor alpha in zebrafish.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - When the amount of pesticide exceeds the self-purification ability of the environment, it will be enriched in the human body through the atmosphere, soil, water circulation, etc., threatening human health. Aryloxy-phenoxy-propionate (APP) herbicides are a class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor herbicides, widely used in field-weeding of soybean, cabbage, peanut and other crops. However, due to the water circulation, surface runoff and the agronomic practices such as watering irrigation, APP herbicides have the risk of polluting water and destroying the living environment of aquatic organisms. In this paper, a multistep framework combining homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were adopted to explore the interactions between APP herbicides and zebrafish estrogen receptor α (ERα) to investigate the estrogenic activities of the herbicides. The structure of zebrafish ERα was modeled by homology modeling, using the human's estrogen receptor α (PDB ID:2YJA) as the template. Then, eight typical APP herbicides were selected to dock with the zebrafish ERα, and it was determined that there were clear interactions between the herbicides and the receptor. The binding patterns of Quizalofop-P-ethyl (QPE), Clodinafop-propargyl (CP) and Haloxyfop-P (HP) with ERα were further investigated by molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculation. The results showed the van der Waals force and electrostatic force were the main driving forces for maintaining the stability of the complex system. In order to verify the theoretical prediction, an exposed experiment was conducted to study the effects of different concentrations of herbicides on VTG level of zebrafish in vivo and the results were consistent with the computational method. The results of this study revealed the mechanism of the action between APP herbicides and zebrafish estrogen receptors, and also provided ideas for optimizing the herbicides.

T2  - Polish journal of veterinary sciences
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Simazine is a triazine herbicide which has been used for a long period in agriculture and in the aquatic environment for control of weeds and algae. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subchronic exposure to simazine on growth and the development of histopathological changes in selected organs (gills, kidney, liver) in Danio rerio. METHODS: Juvenile growth tests were performed on D. rerio according to the OECD method No. 215. Fish at the age of 20 days were exposed to the environmental simazine concentration commonly detected in Czech rivers (0.06 μg.L-1) and a range of sublethal concentrations of simazine (0.6, 6.0 and 60.0 μg.L-1) for 28 days. RESULTS: There were no significant differences (p\textless0.05) between the specific growth rates (r) of the test groups and those of both control groups. Histopathological examination revealed pathological changes in fish exposed to a simazine concentration of 60.0 μg.L-1. The values of NOEC and LOEC of simazine were 6.0 μg.L-1 and 60.0 μg.L-1. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental concentration of simazine in Czech rivers did not have any effects on the growth and development of histopathological changes in D. rerio.

TI  - Robust behavioural effects in response to acute, but not repeated, terpene administration in Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Terpenes are fragrant aromatic compounds produced by a variety of plants, most notably cannabis and hops. With increasing legalization of cannabis there is a need to better understand the behavioural effects of terpenes and ultimately their therapeutic value. Our study investigated the dose-dependent impact of three terpenes (limonene 0.25, 0.5, 0.75%; β-myrcene 0.001, 0.01, 0.1%; and 0.0001, 0.001, 0.00125% linalool) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) behaviour when exposed both acutely and repeatedly over a 7-day period. Anxiety-like behaviour, boldness, and locomotion were assessed using the open field test and the novel object approach test. In the acute dosing experiment, limonene and β-myrcene exposed groups demonstrated a significant decrease in locomotion, a decrease in anxiety-like behaviour, and an increase in boldness, while linalool treatment groups demonstrated only minor alterations in locomotion. Moreover, repeated exposure to limonene (0.39%) or β-myrcene (0.0083%) for a seven day period did not result in any significant behavioural effects. In conclusion, our study provides support for an anxiolytic and sedative effect in zebrafish in response to acute limonene and β-myrcene exposure that is no longer present after one week of repeated exposure.

TI  - Embryonic Exposure to 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-95) Causes Developmental Malformations in Zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - 2,2',3,5',6-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-95) is an environmental neurotoxicant. There is accumulated evidence that some neurotoxic effects of PCB-95 are caused by increased spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in neurons resulting from modifying ryanodine receptors (RyR) in calcium-releasing channels. However, there are large gaps in explaining brain and other developmental malformations on embryonic PCB-95 exposure. In the present study, we address those deficiencies by studying the toxic effects of PCB-95 using zebrafish as an ontogenetic model. To characterize these effects, zebrafish embryos with intact chorions were exposed to 4 different concentrations of PCB-95 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ppm) for 3 consecutive days. The controls were maintained in 0.5 × E2 medium or egg water and in 0.1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/0.5 × E2 medium or egg water. PCB-95-treated groups showed dose-dependent decreases in survival and hatching rates, with increased rates of developmental malformations when compared to controls. These include morphological malformations, brain cell necrosis, and smaller eye sizes at 5 d post fertilization. These data suggest potential mechanisms underlying the abnormal behavior observed in a visual stimulus assay. The present study provides insight into PCB-95-induced developmental toxicity and supports the use of the zebrafish model in understanding the effects of PCB-95 exposure.

TI  - The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of single and combined fenthion and terbufos treatments in human liver cells and zebrafish embryos.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The mechanism of genotoxicity of the individual and combined pesticides of terbufos and fenthion were evaluated using HepG2 cells and zebrafish embryos. We determined genotoxicity by neutral comet assay and phosphorylation of H(2)AX (γH(2)AX), which indicated that cells treated with terbufos and/or fenthion caused DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The combination of these pesticides at the equimolar concentration (40 μM) exhibited less toxicity, genotoxicity, and did not impact DNA homologous recombination (HR) repair activity compare to terbufos or fenthion alone treatment. In HepG2 cells, terbufos, fenthion and their combination decreased only Xrcc2 expression (one of DNA HR repair genes). Moreover, the combined pesticides decreased Xrcc6 expression (one of DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair genes). In addition, only terbufos or fenthion decreased XRCC2 protein expression, while Ku70 was impacted in all of the treated cells irrespective of up or down regulation. In zebrafish embryos, only fenthion impaired HR genes (Rad51 and Rad18) expression at 24 h. After 48 h exposure to pesticides, the combined pesticides elevated HR genes (Rad51 and Xrcc2) expression while terbufos or fenthion inhibited the expression of these four genes (Rad51, Rad18, Xrcc2, Xrcc6). In addition, the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos with fenthion or the combined pesticide at 72 hpf was significantly impaired. Collectively, terbufos and/or fenthion in combining caused DSBs in HepG2 cells and zebrafish embryos. Moreover, the specific mechanism of combined pesticide both HepG2 and zebrafish embryos revealed antagonism interaction.

TI  - Acute toxicity to zebrafish of two organophosphates and four pyrethroids and their binary mixtures.
T2  - Pest management science
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental pollutants, including metals, pesticides and other organics, pose serious risks to many aquatic organisms. The acute toxicities to zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio Hamilton & Buchanan) were determined for two organophosphorus insecticides, four pyrethroid insecticides and 50:50 binary mixtures. RESULTS: At 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after treatment, LC(50) of permethrin, tetramethrin, bifenthrin, etofenprox, dichlorvos and phoxim to zebrafish were 0.0052-0.0025, 0.0782-0.0460, 0.0065-0.0032, 0.0969-0.0791, 51.3-13.0 and 1.28-0.469 mg L(-1) respectively. LC(50) of permethrin + dichlorvos, permethrin + phoxim, tetramethrin + dichlorvos, tetramethrin + phoxim, bifenthrin + dichlorvos, bifenthrin + phoxim, etofenprox + dichlorvos and etofenprox + phoxim were 0.0082-0.0046, 0.0078-0.0042, 0.264-0.124, 0.141-0.121, 0.0251-0.0154, 0.0154-0.0087, 0.396-0.217 and 0.213-0.0391 mg L(-1). CONCLUSION: Toxicity levels of all pyrethroid insecticides to the zebrafish were high or very high. The organophosphate dichlorvos showed low toxicity, but phoxim showed high or intermediate toxicities to zebrafish, and the toxicities of binary mixtures of permethrin and dichlorvos or phoxim, bifenthrin and dichlorvos or phoxim and etofenprox and phoxim (48, 72 and 96 h exposure) were very high. The toxicities of binary mixtures of tetramethrin and dichlorvos or phoxim, etofenprox and dichlorvos and etofenprox and phoxim (24 h exposure) were high.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to assess integrated biotoxicity of Xitiaoxi River waters.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Assessing the toxicity posed by mixtures of unknown chemicals to aquatic organisms is challenging. In this study, water samples from six cross-sections along the Xitiaoxi River Basin (XRB) were monthly or bimonthly collected in 2014. The year-period physiochemical parameters as well as one-month-water sample based acute biotoxicity tests showed that the river water quality of the year was generally in a good status. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) screening based on one-month-water samples suggested that the organic pollutants might be non-to-moderately-polar chemicals in very low concentrations. One-month-water sample based RNA-seq was performed to measure the mRNA differential expression profile of zebrafish larvae to furtherly explore the potential bioeffect and the spatial water quality change of the river. Result indicated that the number of deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) tended to increase along the downstream direction of the river. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis implied that the key pollutants might mainly be the function disruptors of biological processes. Principle components analysis (PCA) combining with transcripts and one-month-water sample based physiochemical parameters indicated that the pollution might be similar at TP, DP and CTB sites while pollution homology existed on some extent between YBQ and JW sites. Although the water quality of the river had a complex time-space alternation during the year, and the one-month-data based RNA-seq could not reflex the whole year-water quality of a watershed, the gene expression profile via RNA-seq provided an alternative way for assessing integrated biotoxicity of surface water, and it was relatively fit for early-warning of water quality of a watershed with unobservable acute toxicity. However, the identification of detail toxicants and the links between DEGs and pollution level as well as physiological-biochemical toxicity needed further investigation.

TI  - Biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers and cell cycle assessment in the zebrafish liver (ZF-L) cell line exposed to the novel metal-insecticide magnesium-hespiridin complex.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The flavonoid metal-insecticide magnesium-hesperidin complex (MgHP) has recently been considered as a novel insecticide to replace some persistent pesticides. However, it is important to evaluate its action on non-target species, mainly those living in an aquatic environment, as these ecosystems are the final receptors of most chemicals. Reactive oxygen species, antioxidant and oxidative stress biomarkers, genotoxicity as well as cell cycle was evaluated in the liver cell line from zebrafish (Danio rerio; ZF-L) exposed to 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng mL(-1) MgHP. MgHP affected cell stability by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both exposure times (24 and 96 h) at high concentrations. Catalase (CAT) activity decreased after 24 h exposure, and glutathione and metallothionein values increased, avoiding the lipid peroxidation. Genotoxicity increased as MgHP concentration increased, after 24 h exposure, exhibiting nuclear abnormalities; it was recovered after 96 h exposure, evidencing possible stimulation of DNA repair mechanisms. The alteration in the cell cycle (increasing in the Sub-G1 phase and decreasing in the S-phase) was associated with chromosomal instability. In conclusion, the responses of ROS and the antioxidant defense system depended on MgHP concentration and time exposure, while DNA exhibited some instability after 24 h exposure, which was recovered after 96 h.

TI  - Enantioselectivity in Developmental Toxicity of rac-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Embryo.
T2  - Chirality
AB  - Enantioselectivity of chiral pesticides in environmental safety has attracted more and more attention. In this study, we evaluated the enantioselective toxicity of rac-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos through various malformations including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, crooked body, and short tails. The results showed that there were significant differences in toxicity to zebrafish embryos caused by rac-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl, and the LC50 s at 96 h are 416.41 (353.91, 499.29) mg · L(-1) and 320.650 (279.80, 363.46) mg · L(-1) , respectively. In order to explore the possible mechanism of the development defects, the genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (vtg1, vtg2, cyp17, cyp19a, cyp19b) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (dio1, dio2, nis, tg, tpo) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results revealed that there were no significant differences in the expression of vtg1, vtg2, cyp17, cyp19a, and cyp19b after exposure to rac-metalaxyl. However, the expression of vtg1, cyp19a, and cyp19b decreased significantly after exposure to R-metalaxyl. And likewise, rac-metalaxyl only caused the upregulation of dio2, while R-metalaxyl suppressed the expression of dio1 and tpo and induced the expression of dio2 and nis. The change of gene expression may cause the enantioselectivity in developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryo. The data provided here will be helpful for us to comprehensively understand the potential ecological risks of the currently used chiral fungicides.

TI  - PCB and TCDD derived embryonic cardiac defects result from a novel AhR pathway.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) are environmental contaminants known to impact cardiac development, a key step in the embryonic development of most animals. To date, little is understood of the molecular mechanism driving the observed cardiac defects in exposed fishes. The literature shows PCB & TCDD derived cardiac defects are concurrent with, but not caused by, expression of cyp1A, due to activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) gene activation pathway. However, in this study, detailed visualization of fish hearts exposed to PCBs and TCDD show that, in addition to a failure of cardiac looping in early heart development, the inner endocardial lining of the heart fails to maintain proper cell adhesion and tissue integrity. The resulting gap between the endocardium and myocardium in both zebrafish and Atlantic sturgeon suggested functional faults in endothelial adherens junction formation. Thus, we explored the molecular mechanism triggering cardiac defects using immunohistochemistry to identify the location and phosphorylation state of key regulatory and adhesion molecules. We hypothesized that PCB and TCDD activates AhR, phosphorylating Src, which then phosphorylates the endothelial adherens junction protein, VEcadherin. When phosphorylated, VEcadherin dimers, found in the endocardium and vasculature, separate, reducing tissue integrity. In zebrafish, treatment with PCB and TCDD contaminants leads to higher phosphorylation of VEcadherin in cardiac tissue suggesting that these cells have reduced connectivity. Small molecule inhibition of Src phosphorylation prevents contaminant stimulated phosphorylation of VEcadherin and rescues both cardiac function and gross morphology. Atlantic sturgeon hearts show parallels to contaminant exposed zebrafish cardiac phenotype at the tissue level. These data suggest that the mechanism for PCB and TCDD action in the heart is, in part, distinct from the canonical mechanism described in the literature and that cardiac defects are impacted by this nongenomic mechanism.

TI  - Microbiome analysis and predicted relative metabolomic turnover suggest bacterial heme and selenium metabolism are altered in the gastrointestinal system of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to the organochlorine dieldrin.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Dietary exposure to chemicals alters the diversity of microbiome communities and can lead to pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal system. The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is a persistent environmental contaminant that bioaccumulates in fatty tissue of aquatic organisms. The objectives of this study were to determine whether environmentally-relevant doses of dieldrin altered gastrointestinal morphology and the microbiome of zebrafish. Adult zebrafish at ∼4 months of age were fed a measured amount of feed containing either a solvent control or one of two doses of dieldrin (measured at 16, and 163.5 ng/g dry weight) for 4 months. Dieldrin body burden levels in zebrafish after four-month exposure were 0 (control), 11.47 ± 1.13 ng/g (low dose) and 18.32 ± 1.32 ng/g (high dose) wet weight [mean ± std]. Extensive histopathology at the whole organism level revealed that dieldrin exposure did not induce notable tissue pathology, including the gastrointestinal tract. A repeated measure mixed model analysis revealed that, while fish gained weight over time, there were no dieldrin-specific effects on body weight. Fecal content was collected from the gastrointestinal tract of males and 16S rRNA gene sequencing conducted. Dieldrin at a measured feed dose of 16 ng/g reduced the abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum involved in energy resorption. At the level of class, there was a decrease in abundance of Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, and an increase in Verrucomicrobiae species. We used a computational approach called predicted relative metabolomic turnover (PRMT) to predict how a shift in microbial community composition affects exchange of metabolites. Dieldrin was predicted to affect metabolic turnover of uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I [enzyme]-cysteine, hydrogen selenide, selenite, and methyl-selenic acid in the fish gastrointestinal system. These pathways are related to bacterial heme biosynthesis and selenium metabolism. Our study demonstrates that dietary exposures to dieldrin can alter microbiota composition over 4 months, however the long-term consequences of such impacts are not well understood.

TI  - An environmentally relevant mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) disrupts mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism and neurotransmission in the brain of exposed zebrafish and their unexposed F2 offspring.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent organic pollutants still present in aquatic environments despite their total or partial ban. Previously, we observed that an environmentally realistic mixture of these compounds affects energy balance, growth, and reproduction in exposed zebrafish (F0), and behavior in their unexposed offspring (F1-F4). In the present work, we performed lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses on brains of zebrafish (F0-F2) from exposed and control lineages to identify molecular changes that could explain the observed phenotypes. The use of both technologies highlighted that F0 zebrafish displayed impaired mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism regulation (depletion in triacylglycerols and phospholipids) which can explain disruption of energy homeostasis. A subset of the regulated biological pathways related to energetic metabolism and neurotransmission were inherited in F2. In addition, there were increasing effects on epigenetic pathways from the F0 to the F2 generation. Altogether, we show that the effects of an environmental exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on energetic metabolism as well as neurotransmission extend over 2 generations of zebrafish, possibly due to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

TI  - Optical toxicity of triphenyl phosphate in zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) has been shown to cause developmental neurotoxicty. Considering the visual system is a sensitive target, in the present study, we investigated the potential toxicity of TPhP on the visual development and function in zebrafish larvae. Embryos were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 30 μg/L TPhP from 2 to 144 h post-fertilization (hpf). The transcription of photoreceptor opsin genes, and histopathological changes in the retina and visual behavior (optokinetic and phototactic responses) were evaluated. TPhP significantly downregulated the transcription of opsin genes (zfrho, opn1sw1, opn1sw2, opn1mw1, opn1mw2, opn1mw3, opn1mw4, opn1lw1 and opn1lw2) in all exposure groups. Histopathological analysis revealed that the areas of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina were significantly reduced in the 10 and 30 μg/L TPhP groups. The number of ganglion cells was reduced significantly in the 30 μg/L group. The optokinetic response (OKR) and phototactic response showed dose-dependent decreases caused by impaired visual function, which was confirmed by unchanged locomotor activity. The results indicated that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TPhP could inhibit the transcription of genes related to visual function and impair retinal development, thus leading to visual impairment in zebraﬁsh larvae.

TI  - DNA damage and oxidative stress induced by endosulfan exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Ecotoxicology (London, England)
AB  - Endosulfan (6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzo-dioxathiepin-3-oxide), an organochlorine pesticide, is prevalently used all around the world. It is considered to be a new candidate for the persistent organic pollutants group. Endosulfan residues in the environment may cause serious damage to ecosystems, especially in aquatic environments. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of endosulfan on antioxidant enzymes [catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage in zebrafish. Male and female zebrafish were separated and exposed to a control solution and four concentrations of endosulfan (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg L⁻¹) and were sampled after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. It is noteworthy that the present research explored the correlation among the three indicators induced by endosulfan. Low endosulfan concentrations (0.01 μg L⁻¹) induced a slight increase of SOD and CAT activity, which kept ROS in a stable level. High endosulfan concentration (10 μg L⁻¹) induced excessive ROS production which exceeded the capacity of the cellular antioxidants and exhausted the enzyme including CAT and SOD. The DNA damage of zebrafish was evaluated by single-cell gel electrophoresis and was enhanced with increasing endosulfan concentration. In conclusion, the present study showed that endosulfan (0.01-10 μg L⁻¹) has toxic effects on zebrafish.

TI  - Rapid Zebrafish Behavioral Profiling Assay Accelerates the Identification of Environmental Neurodevelopmental Toxicants.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Rapid and cost-effective in vivo assays to screen potential environmental neurodevelopmental toxicants are necessary to address the limitations of in vitro platforms, such as the inability to fully recapitulate the developmental and physiological processes of whole organisms. In the present study, a rapid zebrafish behavioral profiling assay was developed to characterize the neurodevelopmental effects of environmental substances by quantitatively evaluating multiple spontaneous movement features of zebrafish embryos. This video analysis-based assay automatically segmented every embryo and thus was able to accurately quantify spontaneous movement features, including frequency, duration, intensity, interval, and the number of continuous movements. When tested with eight environmental substances known to be neurodevelopmental toxicants, such as chlorpyrifos and bisphenol A, the assay successfully captured frequency alterations that were well-documented in previous studies while also providing additional information. Using an optimized procedure, we further assessed 132 potential neurotoxins that spanned a wide range of molecular targets, many of which were previously detected in environmental waterbodies. The distinct altered behavioral barcodes indicated that the spontaneous movement was impacted by diverse neuroactive substances, and the effects could be effectively evaluated with the developed assay. The web-based tool, named EMAnalysis, is further provided at http://www.envh.sjtu.edu.cn/zebrafish_contraction.jsp. Thus, this assay provides an efficient platform to accelerate the pace of neurotoxic environmental contaminant discoveries.

TI  - Dose addition in chemical mixtures inducing craniofacial malformations in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association
AB  - A challenge in cumulative risk assessment is to model hazard of mixtures. EFSA proposed to only combine chemicals linked to a defined endpoint, in so-called cumulative assessment groups, and use the dose-addition model as a default to predict combined effects. We investigated the effect of binary mixtures of compounds known to cause craniofacial malformations, by assessing the effect in the head skeleton (M-PQ angle) in 120hpf zebrafish embryos. We combined chemicals with similar mode of action (MOA), i.e. the triazoles cyproconazole, triadimefon and flusilazole; next, reference compounds cyproconazole or triadimefon were combined with dissimilar acting compounds, TCDD, thiram, VPA, prochloraz, fenpropimorph, PFOS, or endosulfan. These mixtures were designed as (near) equipotent combinations of the contributing compounds, in a range of cumulative concentrations. Dose-addition was assessed by evaluation of the overlap of responses of each of the 14 tested binary mixtures with those of the single compounds. All 10 test compounds induced an increase of the M-PQ angle, with varying potency and specificity. Mixture responses as predicted by dose-addition did not deviate from the observed responses, supporting dose-addition as a valid assumption for mixture risk assessment. Importantly, dose-addition was found irrespective of MOA of contributing chemicals.

AB  - The ability to regulate small molecule chemistry in vivo will enable new avenues of exploration in imaging and pharmacology. However, realization of these goals will require reactions with high specificity and precise control. Here we demonstrate photocontrol over the highly specific Staudinger-Bertozzi ligation in vitro and in vivo. Our simple approach, photocaging the key phosphine atom, allows for the facile production of reagents with photochemistry that can be engineered for specific applications. The resulting compounds, which are both stable and efficiently activated, enable the spatial labeling of metabolically introduced azides in vitro and on live zebrafish.

TI  - Target and non-target toxicity of fern extracts against mosquito vectors and beneficial aquatic organisms.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Dengue and malaria are significant mosquito-borne diseases that are rapidly spread worldwide, mainly in temperate countries. Pteridophytes were identified to be a significant source of novel mosquitocidal agents. The present research was to explore the eco-friendly larvicides from methanol extracts of ferns, viz., Actiniopteris radiata, Adiantum caudatum, Cheilanthes swartzii, Hemionitis arifolia and Lycopodium clavatum. The larvicidal potential of the extracts screened using larvae of dengue vector Aedes aegypti (III and IV instar) and malarial vector Anopheles stephensi (III and IV instar), showed 10-100% mortality rates. Biosafety assessment was made on embryos of Danio rerio and Artemia nauplii. The phyto-constituents of the methanol extract of A. radiata leaves were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Methanolic leaf extracts of A. radiata, A. caudatum and C. swartzii exhibited larvicidal activity against III and IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti (LC(50): 37.47, 74.51 and 152.38 and 67.58, 95.89 and 271.46 ppm) and An. stephensi (LC(50): 70.35, 112.12 and 301.05 and 113.83, 175.30 and 315.19 ppm), respectively. The GC-MS of the methanol extract of A. radiata leaves revealed the presence of 7 phyto-components among which, Carbamic acid, phenyl-, (2-Nitrophenyl) methyl ester (1), Benzoic acid, 3- methylbenzoate (2) and 4-(benzylimino)- 1,4-dihydro-1-(p-toluoylmethyl) pyridine (3) were dominant. Biosafety assessment of methanol extract of A. radiata leaves on embryos of Danio rerio (Zebra fish) and Artemia nauplii (micro crustacean) revealed that there were no destructive or teratogenic effects. To conclude, the larvicidal activity and insignificant toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms of A. radiata leaves makes it a potential and environment safe biocontrol agent against dengue and malarial vectors.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of triphenyl phosphate in zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), a typical organophosphate ester, is frequently detected in the environment and biota samples. It has been implicated as a neurotoxin as its structure is similar to neurotoxic organophosphate pesticides. The purpose of the present study was to investigate its potential developmental neurotoxicity in fish by using zebrafish larvae as a model. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 0.8, 4, 20 and 100 μg/L of TPhP from 2 until 144 h post-fertilization. TPhP was found to have high bioconcentrations in zebrafish larvae after exposure. Further, it significantly reduced locomotor activity as well as the heart rate at the 100 μg/L concentration. TPhP exposure significantly altered the content of the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric and histamine. Downregulation of the genes related to central nervous system development (e.g., α1-tubulin, mbp, syn2a, shha, and elavl3) as well as the corresponding proteins (e.g., α1-tubulin, mbp, and syn2a) was observed, but the gap-43 protein was found to upregulated. Finally, marked inhibition of total acetylcholinesterase activity, which is considered as a biomarker of neurotoxicant exposure, was also observed in the larvae. Our results indicate that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TPhP can affect different parameters related to center nervous system development, and thus contribute to developmental neurotoxicity in early developing zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Bifenthrin causes transcriptomic alterations in mTOR and ryanodine receptor-dependent signaling and delayed hyperactivity in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Over the last few decades, the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin has been increasingly employed for pest control in urban and agricultural areas, putting humans and wildlife at increased risk of exposure. Exposures to nanomolar (nM) concentrations of bifenthrin have recently been reported to alter calcium oscillations in rodent neurons. Neuronal calcium oscillations are influenced by ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity, which modulates calcium-dependent signaling cascades, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. RyR activity and mTOR signaling play critical roles in regulating neurodevelopmental processes. However, whether environmentally relevant levels of bifenthrin alter RyR or mTOR signaling pathways to influence neurodevelopment has not been addressed. Therefore, our main objectives in this study were to examine the transcriptomic responses of genes involved in RyR and mTOR signaling pathways in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin, and to assess the potential functional consequences by measuring locomotor responses to external stimuli. Wildtype zebrafish were exposed for 1, 3 and 5 days to 1, 10 and 50 ng/L bifenthrin, followed by a 14 d recovery period. Bifenthrin elicited significant concentration-dependent transcriptional responses in the majority of genes examined in both signaling cascades, and at all time points examined during the acute exposure period (1, 3, and 5 days post fertilization; dpf), and at the post recovery assessment time point (19 dpf). Changes in locomotor behavior were not evident during the acute exposure period, but were observed at 19 dpf, with main effects (increased locomotor behavior) detected in fish exposed developmentally to bifenthrin at 1 or 10 ng/L, but not 50 ng/L. These findings illustrate significant influences of developmental exposures to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin on neurodevelopmental processes in zebrafish.

TI  - Pyriproxyfen induces intracellular calcium overload and alters antioxidant defenses in Danio rerio testis that may influence ongoing spermatogenesis.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - We investigated the in vitro effects of pyriproxyfen on ionic balance in the testis of the zebrafish by measuring (45)Ca(2+) influx. In vivo pyriproxyfen treatment was carried out to study oxidative stress, and conduct morphological analysis of the testis and liver. Whole testes were incubated in vitro with/without pyriproxyfen (10(-12), 10(-9) or 10(-6) M; 30 min) and (45)Ca(2+) influx determined. To study pyriproxyfen's mechanism of action, inhibitors/activators of ionic channels or pumps/exchangers, protein kinase inhibitors or a calcium chelator were added 15 min before the addition of (45)Ca(2+) and pyriproxyfen. We evaluated the in vivo effects of 7 day exposure to waterborne pyriproxyfen (10(-9) M) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione content (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity. Morphological analyses of the testis and liver were carried out after in vivo exposure of D. rerio to pyriproxyfen. Pyriproxyfen increased (45)Ca(2+) influx by opening the voltage-dependent T-type channels (T-type VDCC), inhibiting sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (45)Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and the NCX exchanger (forward mode) and by mobilizing calcium from stores. The involvement of potassium channels and protein kinase C (PKC) was also demonstrated in pyriproxyfen-induced intracellular calcium elevation. In vivo pyriproxyfen treatment of D. rerio increased lipid peroxidation, decreased GSH content and increased GST activity in testes, in addition to increasing the number and size of spermatogonia cysts and inducing hepatocyte basophilia and dilation of blood vessels in the liver. The toxicity of pyriproxyfen is mediated by calcium overload, increased lipid peroxidation, and a diminished antioxidant capacity in the testis, due to GSH depletion, and altered spermatogenesis. The development of high basophilia in the liver suggests that pyriproxyfen may have estrogenic activity, possibly acting as an endocrine-disruptor. These findings indicate that these alterations may contribute to pyriproxyfen toxicity and spermatogenesis disruption.

TI  - The cardiovascular toxicity of triadimefon in early life stage of zebrafish and potential implications to human health.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - The health risk of triadimefon (TF) to cardiovascular system of human is still unclear, especially to pesticide suicides population, occupational population (farmers, retailers and pharmaceutical workers), and special population (young children and infants, pregnant women, older people, and those with compromised immune systems) who are at a greater risk. Therefore, firstly we explored the toxic effects and possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity induced by TF using zebrafish model. Zebrafish at stage of 48 h post fertilization (hpf) exposed to TF for 24 h exhibited morphological malformations which were further confirmed by histopathologic examination, including pericardial edema, circulation abnormalities, serious venous thrombosis and increased distance between the sinus venosus (SV) and bulbus arteriosus (BA) regions of the heart. In addition to morphological changes, TF induced functional deficits in the heart of zebrafish, including bradycardia and a significant reduced cardiac output that became more serious at higher concentrations. To better understand the possible molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish, we investigated the transcriptional level of genes related to calcium signaling pathway and cardiac muscle contraction. Q-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) results demonstrated that the expression level of genes related to ATPase (atp2a1l, atp1b2b, atp1a3b), calcium channel (cacna1ab, cacna1da) and cardiac troponin C (tnnc1a) were significantly decreased after TF exposure. For the first time, the present study revealed that TF exposure had observable morphological and functional negative impacts on cardiovascular system of zebrafish. Mechanistically, this toxicity might result from the pressure of down-regulation of genes associated with calcium signaling pathway and cardiac muscle contraction following TF exposure. These findings generated here can provide information for better pesticide poisoning treatments, occupational disease prevention, and providing theoretical foundation for risk management measures.

TI  - Systematic Evaluation of Chiral Fungicide Imazalil and Its Major Metabolite R14821 (Imazalil-M): Stability of Enantiomers, Enantioselective Bioactivity, Aquatic Toxicity, and Dissipation in Greenhouse Vegetables and Soil.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - Chiral pesticides are often produced and applied without distinguishing the difference of enantiomers, which sometimes leads to overuse and inaccurate risk assessment. Imazalil is a widely used chiral fungicide; its parent and major metabolite R14821 (imazalil-M) are usually detected in environmental and plant samples. The enantioselective bioactivity of imazalil enantiomers to seven typical pathogens (e.g., Fulvia fulva) was explored. S-(+)-Imazalil showed 3.00-6.59 times higher bioactivity than its antipode for selected pathogens. Molecular docking partly explained the mechanism of enantioselectivity in bioactivity. S-(+)-Imazalil had a stronger hydrophobic interaction and lower energy conformation with binding sites than R-(-)-imazalil. The acute toxicity of S-(+)-imazalil was 1.23-fold and 2.25-fold more than R-(-)-imazalil to P. subcapitata and D. magna, respectively. And, S-(+)-imazalil-M had 2.21-fold and 1.70-fold higher toxicity than R-(-)-imazalil-M to P. subcapitata and D. magna, respectively. However, R-(-)-imazalil was 1.21 times more toxic than S-(+)-imazalil to D. rerio. The enantioselective dissipation of imazalil and imazalil-M was explored under greenhouse conditions. High-effective S-(+)-imazalil preferentially enriched in leaf and fruit of tomato and cucumber, and no enantioselective degradation was found in soil. Imazalil-M enantiomers formed in cucumber, leaf of cucumber, and tomato, and the EF values fluctuated between 0.332 and 0.499. The results could provide information for more accurate assessment of imazalil; they implicated that using S-(+)-imazalil could reduce pesticide input and the risk to D. rerio.

TI  - Differential mitochondrial dysregulation by exposure to individual organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and their mixture in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been reported to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. However, most studies reported its mitochondrial toxicity with respect to a single form, which is far from the environmentally relevant conditions. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to five OCPs: chlordane, heptachlor, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), as well as an equal ratio mixture of these OCPs. We evaluated mitochondrial function, including oxygen consumption, the activity of mitochondrial complexes, antioxidant reactions, and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. Oxygen consumption rate was reduced by exposure to chlordane, and β-HCH, linking to the increased activity of specific mitochondrial complex I and III, and decreased GSH level. We found that these mitochondrial dysfunctions were more significant in the exposure to the OCP mixture than the individual OCPs. On the mRNA transcription level, the individual OCPs mainly dysregulated the metabolic cycle (i.e., cs and acadm), whereas the OCP mixture disrupted the genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., sdha). Consequently, we demonstrate that the OCP mixture disrupts mitochondrial metabolism by a different molecular mechanism than the individual OCPs, which warrants further study to evaluate mitochondrial dysregulation by chronic exposure to the OCP mixture.

TI  - Enhanced toxicity of triphenyl phosphate to zebrafish in the presence of micro- and nano-plastics.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Co-occurrence of microplastics and chemicals was a complex environmental issue, whereas little concerned on the effect of microplastics on the toxicity of chemicals. In this study, we studied the changes of toxicity of triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) to zebrafish, in the presence of micro-polystyrene (MPS, 5.8 μm) and nano-polystyrene (NPS, 46 nm). Results indicated that separate MPS and NPS had no acute toxicity and little reproductive toxicity on zebrafish. TPhP alone was a highly toxic substance with a median lethal concentration (LC(50)) of 976 μg/L, the presence of MPS and NPS did not have significant effect on the acute toxicity of TPhP. TPhP alone stimulated the enlargement of liver and gonad of fish (except the testis) by 1.25-2.12 fold, and the presence of NPS further aggravated this stimulation by 1.23-2.84 fold, while MPS did not. The gonadal histology indicated that comparing with TPhP alone, the addition of MPS and NPS further inhibited the process of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, even causing obvious lacunas in testis and atretic follicles oocytes in ovary. Meanwhile, TPhP did not significantly disturb the hormone homeostasis (E(2)/T) and vitellogenin (Vtg) content in fish, but the presence of NPS increased the E(2)/T ratio and Vtg content in male fish, while slightly decreased those in female fish, which implying that effects of PS was sex-dependent. As a result, the egg production, the fertilization rate and hatchability of eggs significantly reduced after combined TPhP+PS exposure, demonstrating that co-occurrence of TPhP and PS, especially NPS, could greatly impaired the reproductive performance of zebrafish.

TI  - Embryonic toxicity of epoxiconazole exposure to the early life stage of zebrafish.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Epoxiconazole (EPX), as a broad-spectrum triazole fungicide, is widely used in agriculture to resist pests and diseases, while it may have potential toxicity to non-target organisms. In the present study, early developmental stage zebrafish were used as the subject organisms to assess the toxicity of EPX, and the possible mechanism of toxicity was also discussed by biochemical and transcriptomic analysis. Through embryo toxicity test, we had made it clear that the 96 h LC(50) of embryo was 7.204 mg/L, and acute exposure to EPX effected hatching rate, heartbeats, body length and even morphological defects. Then, by being exposed to EPX for 7 days at concentrations of 175 (1/40 LC(50)), 350 (1/20 LC(50)) and 700 (1/10 LC(50)), biochemical parameters were affected, mainly manifested as increase of the triglyceride (TG) level and decrease of glucose content. Correspondingly, the transcription of genes related of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and cholesterol metabolism were also affected significantly in larval zebrafish. Moreover, some pathways, including lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism were affected through transcriptome sequencing analysis in the larval zebrafish. Further data analysis based on the sequencing, EPX exposure also affected the expression of genes related to cell apoptosis. We further conformed that the bright fluorescence on the liver and bright spots near the liver by acridine orange staining. In addition, the mRNA levels of apoptosis related genes were also significantly affected in the EPX exposed larval zebrafish. Taken together, the work could provide an insight into toxic effects of EPX on the zebrafish larvae at embryo toxicity and transcriptional levels, providing some evidences for the toxic effects of triazole fungicides on non-target organisms.

TI  - Toxic effects of broflanilide exposure on development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and its potential cardiotoxicity mechanism.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Diamide insecticides are a threat to aquatic organisms but the toxicity of broflanilide remains largely undefined. In this study, to clarify the risk of broflanilide to aquatic organisms and explore its possible mechanism, lethal and sub-lethal exposure of zebrafish embryos were performed. The acute toxicity LC(50) (50% lethal concentration) (96 h) of broflanilide to zebrafish embryos and larvae were 3.72 mg/L and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. It also caused toxic symptoms including reduced heart rate, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema and shortened larval body length at ≥ 0.2 mg/L. Understanding the cellular and molecular changes underlying developmental toxicity in early stages of zebrafish may be very important to further improvement of this study. Here, we found cell apoptosis in embryonic heart, significant up-regulation in expression of genes associated with apoptosis and increased activity of caspase-9. In particular, we detected the levels of genes and TBX5 (T-box protein 5) related to cardiac development, which were significantly increased in this study and may be contribution to the cardiotoxicity of embryos. In general, our results identified the aquatic toxicity of broflanilide to the early stage of zebrafish and provide insights into the underlying mechanism in developmental toxicity especially cardiotoxicity of embryos.

TI  - Lipid dynamics in zebrafish embryonic development observed by DESI-MS imaging and nanoelectrospray-MS.
T2  - Molecular bioSystems
AB  - The zebrafish Danio rerio is a model vertebrate organism for understanding biological mechanisms. Recent studies have explored using zebrafish as a model for lipid-related diseases, for in vivo fish bioassays, and for embryonic toxicity experiments. Mass spectrometry (MS) and MS imaging are established tools for lipid profiling and spatial mapping of biomolecules and offer rapid, sensitive, and simple analytical protocols for zebrafish analysis. When ambient ionization techniques are used, ions are generated in native environmental conditions, requiring neither sample preparation nor separation of molecules prior to MS. We used two direct MS techniques to describe the dynamics of the lipid profile during zebrafish embryonic development from 0 to 96 hours post-fertilization and to explore these analytical approaches as molecular diagnostic assays. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS imaging followed by nanoelectrospray (nESI) MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) were used in positive and negative ion modes, allowing the detection of a large variety of phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, ubiquinone, squalene, and other lipids, and revealed information on the spatial distributions of lipids within the embryo and on lipid molecular structure. Differences were observed in the relative ion abundances of free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and ubiquinone - essentially localized to the yolk - across developmental stages, whereas no relevant differences were found in the distribution of complex membrane glycerophospholipids, indicating conserved lipid constitution. Embryos exposed to trichloroethylene for 72 hours exhibited an altered lipid profile, indicating the potential utility of this technique for testing the effects of environmental contaminants.

TI  - Bis-GMA affects craniofacial development in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Estrogen is a steroid hormone that is vital in vertebrate development and plays a role in a variety of developmental processes including cartilage and craniofacial formation. The effects of estrogen can be mimicked by other compounds found in the environment known as xenoestrogens. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a known xenoestrogen and is combined with glycidyl methacrylate to make Bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (Bis-GMA), a major component in dental resin based composites (RBCs). Bis-GMA based RBCs can release their components into the saliva and bloodstream. Exposure to 1μM and 10μM Bis-GMA in Danio rerio embryos results in increased mortality of approximately 30% and 45% respectively. Changes to gross morphology, specifically craniofacial abnormalities, were seen at concentrations as low as 10nM. While the molecular pathways of Bis-GMA effects have not been studied extensively, more is known about one of the components, BPA. Further research of Bis-GMA could lead to a better understanding of xenoestrogenic activity resulting in improved public and environmental health.

TI  - Combined endocrine disruptive toxicity of malathion and cypermethrin to gene transcription and hormones of the HPG axis of male zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Cypermethrin (CYP) and malathion (MAT) have been widely used and are frequently detected in surface waters. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the endocrine disrupting toxicity of CYP, MAT, and CYP + MAT to 5-month-old male zebrafish (Danio rerio). After exposure, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI) did not change significantly. Following exposure to the combination of 0.1 μg/L CYP +25 μg/L MAT, the E2 and VTG levels of male zebrafish were significantly increased compared to those after individual pesticide treatments. The molecular level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in zebrafish was studied; it was found that the expression of the estrogen-related genes, especially the vtg1 gene, was significantly altered in 0.1 μg/L CYP + 25 μg/L MAT. Overall, our observation indicated that CYP or MAT could disturb the hormonal balance, and their combination of 0.1 μg/L CYP +25 μg/L MAT could significantly enhance the estrogenic effect.

TI  - Charge-specific adverse effects of polystyrene nanoplastics on zebrafish (Danio rerio) development and behavior.
T2  - Environment international
AB  - Nanoplastics are being detected with increasing frequency in aquatic environments. Although evidence suggests that nanoplastics can cause overt toxicity to biota across different trophic levels, but there is little understanding of how materials such as differently charged polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NP) impact fish development and behavior. Following exposure to amino-modified (positive charge) PS-NP, fluorescence accumulation was observed in the zebrafish brain and gastrointestinal tract. Positively charged PS-NP induced stronger developmental toxicity (decreased spontaneous movement, heartbeat, hatching rate, and length) and cell apoptosis in the brain and induced greater neurobehavioral impairment as compared to carboxyl-modified (negative charge) PS-NP. These findings correlated well with fluorescence differences indicating PS-NP presence. Targeted neuro-metabolite analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS reveals that positively charged PS-NP decreased levels of glycine, cysteine, glutathione, and glutamic acid, while the increased levels of spermine, spermidine, and tyramine were induced by negatively charged PS-NP. Positively charged PS-NP interacted with the neurotransmitter receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NMDA2B), whereas negatively charged PS-NP impacted the G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1), each with different binding energies that led to behavioral differences. These findings reveal the charge-specific toxicity of nanoplastics to fish and provide new perspective for understanding PS-NP neurotoxicity that is needed to accurately assess potential environmental and health risks of these emerging contaminants.

TI  - Neurodevelopmental toxicity assessments of alkyl phenanthrene and Dechlorane Plus co-exposure in zebrafish.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Alkyl phenanthrene (A-Phen) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that widely co-exist in the environment. It has been established that both A-Phen and DP elicit neurotoxicity, but the potential interactive toxicity of these contaminants is not well-known. To determine whether a mixture of A-Phen and DP would exhibit interactive effects on neurodevelopment, we co-exposed 3-methylphenanthrene (3-MP), a representative of A-Phen, with DP. Our results illustrated that exposure to 5 or 20 μg/L 3-MP alone or in combination with 60 μg/L DP caused neurobehavioral anomalies in zebrafish. In accordance with the behavioral deficits, 3-MP alone or co-exposed with DP significantly decreased axonal growth of secondary motoneurons, altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and induced cell apoptosis in the muscle of zebrafish. Additionally, 3-MP alone or co-exposed with DP significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes. These findings indicate that 3-MP alone or co-exposed with DP induces neurobehavioral deficits through the combined effects on neuronal connectivity and muscle function. Chemical analysis revealed significant increases in 3-MP and DP bioaccumulation in zebrafish co-exposed with 3-MP and DP. Elevated bioaccumulation resulting from mixture exposure may represent a significant contribution of the synergistic effects observed in combined chemical exposure.

TI  - Organophosphorus diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) intoxication in zebrafish larvae causes behavioral defects, neuronal hyperexcitation and neuronal death.
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - With millions of intoxications each year and over 200,000 deaths, organophosphorus (OP) compounds are an important public health issue worldwide. OP poisoning induces cholinergic syndrome, with respiratory distress, hypertension, and neuron damage that may lead to epileptic seizures and permanent cognitive deficits. Existing countermeasures are lifesaving but do not prevent long-lasting neuronal comorbidities, emphasizing the urgent need for animal models to better understand OP neurotoxicity and identify novel antidotes. Here, using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a prototypic and moderately toxic OP, combined with zebrafish larvae, we first showed that DFP poisoning caused major acetylcholinesterase inhibition, resulting in paralysis and CNS neuron hyperactivation, as indicated by increased neuronal calcium transients and overexpression of the immediate early genes fosab, junBa, npas4b, and atf3. In addition to these epileptiform seizure-like events, DFP-exposed larvae showed increased neuronal apoptosis, which were both partially alleviated by diazepam treatment, suggesting a causal link between neuronal hyperexcitation and cell death. Last, DFP poisoning induced an altered balance of glutamatergic/GABAergic synaptic activity with increased NR2B-NMDA receptor accumulation combined with decreased GAD65/67 and gephyrin protein accumulation. The zebrafish DFP model presented here thus provides important novel insights into the pathophysiology of OP intoxication, making it a promising model to identify novel antidotes.

TI  - Basagran(®) induces developmental malformations and changes the bacterial community of zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of Basagran(®) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. The embryos were exposed to Basagran(®) at concentrations ranging from 120.0 to 480.6 mg/L, and the effects on embryo development (up to 96 h) and bacterial communities of 96 h-larvae were assessed. The embryo development response was time-dependent and concentration-dependent (106.35 \textless EC(50) \textless 421.58 mg/L). The sensitivity of embryo-related endpoints decreased as follows: blood clotting in the head and/or around the yolk sac \textgreater delay or anomaly in yolk sac absorption \textgreater change in swimming equilibrium \textgreater development of pericardial and/or yolk sac oedema \textgreater scoliosis. A PCR-DGGE analysis was used to evaluate changes in the structure, richness, evenness and diversity of bacterial communities after herbicide exposure. A herbicide-induced structural adjustment of bacterial community was observed. In this study, it was successfully demonstrated that Basagran(®) affected zebrafish embryos and associated bacterial communities, showing time-dependent and concentration-dependent embryos' developmental response and structural changes in bacterial community. Thus, this work provides for the first time a complementary approach, which is useful to derive robust toxicity thresholds considering the embryo-microbiota system as a whole. The aquatic hazard assessment will be strengthened by combining current ecotoxicological tests with molecular microbiology tools.

TI  - Inhibition in growth and cardiotoxicity of tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate through down-regulating Wnt signaling pathway in early developmental stage of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - As a common organophosphorus flame retardant, tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) is detected in water environment and aquatic animals extensively. Despite previous researches have reported the developmental toxicity of TBOEP in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, few research focused on its underlying mechanisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 20, 200, 1000 and 2000 µg/L TBOEP from 2 until 120 h post-fertilization (hpf) to determine potential mechanisms of developmental toxicity of this compound. Early developmental stage parameters such as body length, survival rate, hatching rate and heart rate were decreased, while malformation rate was ascended. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was carried out at 12, 24, 72 and 120 hpf to demonstrate alterations in expression of genes of Wnt signaling pathway. The results indicated that axin1 was significantly up-regulated, while β-catenin, pkc and wnt11 were down-regulated. Correlation analysis indicated that expression of these genes was significantly correlated with body length. Furthermore, apoptosis was detected in heart region by acridine orange (AO) staining and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In addition, at 120 hpf, occurrence of oxidative stress was observed in zebrafish larvae. Moreover, 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO)， an activator of Wnt pathway, was found to alleviate the inhibiting effects of TBOEP on zebrafish growth. The overall outcomes offered novel viewpoints in toxic effects of TBOEP, and down-regulating Wnt signaling pathway were able to reveal some potential mechanisms of developmental toxicity of TBOEP in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Mitochondria Targeting Non-Isocyanate-Based Polyurethane Nanocapsules for Enzyme-Triggered Drug Release.
T2  - Bioconjugate chemistry
AB  - Surface engineering of nanocarriers allows fine-tuning of their interactions with biological organisms, potentially forming the basis of devices for the monitoring of intracellular events or for intracellular drug delivery. In this context, biodegradable nanocarriers or nanocapsules capable of carrying bioactive molecules or drugs into the mitochondrial matrix could offer new capabilities in treating mitochondrial diseases. Nanocapsules with a polymeric backbone that undergoes programmed rupture in response to a specific chemical or enzymatic stimulus with subsequent release of the bioactive molecule or drug at mitochondria would be particularly attractive for this function. With this goal in mind, we have developed biologically benign nanocapsules using polyurethane-based, polymeric backbone that incorporates repetitive ester functionalities. The resulting nanocapsules are found to be highly stable and monodispersed in size. Importantly, a new non-isocyanate route is adapted for the synthesis of these non-isocyanate polyurethane nanocapsules (NIPU). The embedded ester linkages of these capsules' shells have facilitated complete degradation of the polymeric backbone in response to a stimulus provided by an esterase enzyme. Hydrophilic payloads like rhodamine or doxorubicin can be loaded inside these nanocarriers during their synthesis by an interfacial polymerization reaction. The postgrafting of the nanocapsules with phosphonium ion, a mitochondria-targeting receptor functionality, has helped us achieve the site-specific release of the drug. Co-localization experiments with commercial mitotracker green as well as mitotracker deep red confirmed localization of the cargo in mitochondria. Our in vitro studies confirm that specific release of doxorubicin within mitochondria causes higher cytotoxicity and cell death compared to free doxorubicin. Endogenous enzyme triggered nanocapsule rupture and release of the encapsulated dye is also demonstrated in a zebrafish model. The results of this proof-of-concept study illustrate that NIPU nanocarriers can provide a site-specific delivery vehicle and improve the therapeutic efficacy of a drug or be used to produce organelle-specific imaging studies.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of microRNAs-mRNAs regulating innate immune response of zebrafish larvae against Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection.
T2  - Fish & shellfish immunology
AB  - In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in immunity. Analyses of the functions of miRNAs and their targets are useful in understanding the regulation of the immune response. To understand the relationships between miRNAs and their targets during infection, we used zebrafish as an infection model in which to characterize the miRNA and mRNA transcriptomes of zebrafish larvae infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. We identified the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Overall, 37 known zebrafish miRNAs were differentially expressed in the infection group and 107 predicted target genes of 26 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the mRNA transcriptome. These targets with specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms, such as peripheral nervous system neuron axonogenesis, organophosphate metabolic process, heme binding, protein binding, tetrapyrrole binding, protein dimerization activity, and aromatase activity, which regulate nerve conduction, energy metabolism, hematopoiesis, and protein synthesis. They were also associated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways such as phototransduction, tryptophan metabolism, notch signaling, and purine metabolism. Our findings indicate that miRNAs regulate the innate immune response via complex networks, and zebrafish (Danio rerio, dre)-miR-205-3p, dre-miR-141-5p, dre-miR-200a-5p, dre-miR-92a-2-5p, dre-miR-192, and dre-miR-1788 may play important roles in the innate immune response by regulating target genes.

TI  - Using passive sampling and zebrafish to identify developmental toxicants in complex mixtures.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Using effects-directed analysis, we investigated associations previously observed between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and embryotoxicity in field-deployed low-density polyethylene (LDPE). We conducted effects-directed analysis using a zebrafish embryo assay and iterative fractionation of extracts of LDPE that were deployed in the Portland Harbor superfund megasite, Oregon (USA). Whole extracts induced toxicity including mortality, edema, and notochord distortion at 20% effect concentration (EC20) values of approximately 100, 100, and 10 mg LDPE/mL, respectively. Through fractionation, we determined that PAHs at concentrations similar to previous research did not contribute markedly to toxicity. We also eliminated pesticides, phthalates, musks, and other substances identified in toxic fractions by testing surrogate mixtures. We identified free fatty acids as lethal components of LDPE extracts and confirmed their toxicity with authentic standards. We found chromatographic evidence that dithiocarbamates are responsible for notochord and other sublethal effects, although exact matches were not obtained. Fatty acids and dithiocarbamates were previously unrecorded components of LDPE extracts and likely contribute to the toxicity of the whole mixture. The present study demonstrates the success of effects-directed analysis in nontargeted hazard identification using the zebrafish embryo test as a self-contained battery of bioassays that allows identification of multiple chemicals with different modes of action. This is the first effects-directed analysis to combine LDPE and zebrafish, approaches that are widely applicable to identifying developmental hazards in the bioavailable fraction of hydrophobic organic compounds.

TI  - Synthesis and Characterization of Stimuli-Responsive Poly(2-dimethylamino-ethylmethacrylate)-Grafted Chitosan Microcapsule for Controlled Pyraclostrobin Release.
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - Controllable pesticide release in response to environmental stimuli is highly desirable for better efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Combining the merits of natural and synthetic polymers, pH and temperature dual-responsive chitosan copolymer (CS-g-PDMAEMA) was facilely prepared through free radical graft copolymerization with 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 2-methacrylate (DMAEMA) as the vinyl monomer. An emulsion chemical cross-linking method was used to expediently fabricate pyraclostrobin microcapsules in situ entrapping the pesticide. The loading content and encapsulation efficiency were 18.79% and 64.51%, respectively. The pyraclostrobin-loaded microcapsules showed pH-and thermo responsive release. Microcapsulation can address the inherent limitation of pyraclostrobin that is photo unstable and highly toxic on aquatic organisms. Compared to free pyraclostrobin, microcapsulation could dramatically improve its photostability under ultraviolet light irradiation. Lower acute toxicity against zebra fish on the first day and gradually similar toxicity over time with that of pyraclostrobin technical concentrate were in accordance with the release profiles of pyraclostrobin microcapsules. This stimuli-responsive pesticide delivery system may find promising application potential in sustainable plant protection.

TI  - High-dose acute exposure of paraquat induces injuries of swim bladder, gastrointestinal tract and liver via neutrophil-mediated ROS in zebrafish and their relevance for human health risk assessment.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The exact toxicological mechanisms of paraquat (PQ) poisoning are not entirely clear, especially on the high-level acute exposure. To assess the health risk of PQ, especially to suicidal individuals, accidental ingestion eaters, occupational groups, and special multitude, firstly we explored the acute toxic effect and the possible mechanisms of high-level exposure of PQ using zebrafish. The mainly target organs of PQ were swim bladder which is the homolog of the mammalian lung, followed by gastrointestinal tract and liver. Morphological malformations which were further defined by histopathologic examination include smaller size, fibrosis and inflammatory cell invasion for swim bladder; irregularly arranged or dissolved epithelial folds, loss of villous architecture, and ecclasis of mucosal cells in a smaller lumen for gastrointestinal tract; as well as smaller size, degeneration, fibrous proliferation, atrophy for liver. In addition, PQ enhanced leukocyte recruitment (neutrophil migrated first, followed by macrophage) into swim bladder and induced ROS which can be scavenged by glutathione. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed that PQ increased the expression level of genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as L-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TNF-β, IFN-1, TGF-β, and NF-kB. For the first time, our results demonstrated that acute exposure of PQ induced pulmonary toxicity which was followed by gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity via neutrophil-mediated ROS in zebrafish. In summary, these findings generated here will contribute to our better understanding of characteristics of PQ acute poisoning and can provide valuable information on better PQ poisoning treatments, occupational disease prevention, and providing theoretical foundation for risk management measures.

TI  - Warfarin-exposed zebrafish embryos resembles human warfarin embryopathy in a dose and developmental-time dependent manner - From molecular mechanisms to environmental concerns.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Warfarin is the most worldwide used anticoagulant drug and rodenticide. Since it crosses placental barrier it can induce warfarin embryopathy (WE), a fetal mortality in neonates characterized by skeletal deformities in addition to brain hemorrhages. Although the effects of warfarin exposure in aquatic off target species were already described, the particular molecular toxicological mechanisms during early development are still unclear. Here, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio) to describe and compare the developmental effects of warfarin exposure (0, 15.13, 75.68 and 378.43 mM) on two distinct early developmental phases (embryos and eleuthero-embryos). Although exposure to both developmental phases induced fish mortality, only embryos exposed to the highest warfarin level exhibited features mimicking mammalian WE, e.g. high mortality, higher incidence of hemorrhages and altered skeletal development, among other effects. To gain insights into the toxic mechanisms underlying warfarin exposure, the transcriptome of embryos exposed to warfarin was explored through RNA-Seq and compared to that of control embryos. 766 differentially expressed (564 up- and 202 down-regulated) genes were identified. Gene Ontology analysis revealed particular cellular components (cytoplasm, extracellular matrix, lysosome and vacuole), biological processes (mainly amino acid and lipid metabolism and response to stimulus) and pathways (oxidative stress response and apoptosis signaling pathways) being significantly overrepresented in zebrafish embryos upon warfarin exposure. Protein-protein interaction further evidenced an altered redox system, blood coagulation and vasculogenesis, visual phototransduction and collagen formation upon warfarin exposure. The present study not only describes for the first time the WE in zebrafish, it provides new insights for a better risk assessment, and highlights the need for programming the rat eradication actions outside the fish spawning season to avoid an impact on off target fish community. The urge for the development of more species-specific anticoagulants for rodent pest control is also highlighted.

TI  - Effects of ivermectin on Danio rerio: a multiple endpoint approach: behaviour, weight and subcellular markers.
T2  - Ecotoxicology (London, England)
AB  - Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad acting antihelmintic used in various veterinary pharmaceuticals. It has been shown that IVM enters the aquatic compartment and adversely affects organisms including fish. This study is based on the hypothesis that long term exposure to IVM affects fish and thus, the main objective was to assess the chronic effects of 0.25 and 25 µg IVM/L to zebrafish using multiple endpoints representative of several levels of biological organization: weight, behaviour (swimming and feeding) and subcellular markers including biomarkers for oestrogenicity (vitellogenin-VTG), oxidative stress (catalase-CAT and glutathione-S-transferase-GST) and neurotransmission (cholinesterase-ChE). Concentrations as low as 0.25 µg IVM/L disrupted the swimming behaviour, causing fish to spend more time at the bottom of aquaria. Such reduction of the swimming performance affected the feeding ability which is likely responsible for the weight loss. The effects on weight were gender differentiated, being more pronounced in males (0.25 µg IVM/L) than in females (25 µg IVM/L). Fish exposed to 25 µg/L exhibited darker coloration and mild curvature of the spine. No effects on VTG and AChE were observed, but a reduction on CAT and GST levels was observed in fish exposed to 25 µg IVM/L, although these alterations probably only reflect the general condition of the fish which was significantly compromised at this concentration. Despite that predicted environmental concentrations of IVM are below 0.25 µg/L, the behavioural effects may be translated into important ecological impacts, e.g. at predator-prey interactions where fish competitive advantage can be decreased. Future work should address the link between behaviour disruption and population fitness. The current study was based on a one experiment and multiple endpoint (anchored) approach, allowing the results to be integrated and linked towards a mechanistic understanding.

TI  - Knockdown of AHR1A but not AHR1B exacerbates PAH and PCB-126 toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Various environmental contaminants are known agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is highly conserved across vertebrate species. Due to gene duplication events before and after the divergence of ray- and lobe-finned fishes, many teleosts have multiple AHR isoforms. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has three identified AHRs: AHR1A and AHR1B, the roles of which are not yet well elucidated, and AHR2, which has been shown to mediate the toxicity of various anthropogenic compounds including dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, we sought to explore the role of the two AHR1 isoforms in PAH- and PCB-induced toxicity in zebrafish embryos utilizing morpholino gene knockdown of the AHR isoforms. Knockdown of AHR1B did not affect the toxicity of PAH mixtures or PCB-126, whereas knockdown of AHR1A exacerbated the cardiac toxicity caused by PAH mixtures and PCB-126. Knockdown of AHR1A did not impact the mRNA expression of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 in exposed embryos, but it did result in increased CYP1 activity in exposed embryos. As has been shown previously, knockdown of AHR2 resulted in protection from PAH- and PCB-induced cardiac deformities and prevented CYP1 enzyme activity in exposed embryos. Co-knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 resulted in an intermediate response compared to knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 individually; co-knockdown did not exacerbate nor protect from PAH-induced deformities and embryos exhibited an intermediate CYP1 enzyme activity response. In contrast, co-knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 did protect from PCB-126-induced deformities. These results suggest that AHR1A is not a nonfunctional receptor as previously thought and may play a role in the normal physiology of zebrafish during development and/or the toxicity of environmental contaminants in early life stages.

TI  - A comprehensive review on environmental toxicity of azole compounds to fish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azoles are considered as one of the most efficient fungicides for the treatment of humans, animals, and plant fungal pathogens. They are of significant clinical importance as antifungal drugs and are widely used in personal care products, ultraviolet stabilizers, and in aircraft for its anti-corrosive properties. The prevalence of azole compounds in the natural environment and its accumulation in fish raises questions about its impact on aquatic organisms. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to review the scientific studies on the effects of azole compounds in fish and to discuss future opportunities for the risk evaluation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to locate peer-reviewed scientific articles on occurrence, environmental fate, and toxicological impact of azole fungicides on fish. RESULTS: Studies included in this review provide ample evidence that azole compounds are not only commonly detected in the natural environment but also cause several detrimental effects on fish. Future studies with environmentally relevant concentrations of azole alone or in combination with other commonly occurring contaminants in a multigenerational study could provide a better understanding. CONCLUSION: Based on current knowledge and studies reporting adverse biological effects of azole on fish, considerable attention is required for better management and effective ecological risk assessment of these emerging contaminants.

TI  - Mixture toxicity of water contaminants-effect analysis using the zebrafish embryo assay (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Three water contaminants were selected to be tested in the zebrafish embryo toxicity test (DarT) in order to investigate the sensitivity of the zebrafish embryo toxicity test with respect to mixture effect detection. The concentration-response curves for the observed effects lethality and hypo-pigmentation were calculated after an exposure of the embryos for 96 h with a fungicide (carbendazim), a plasticizer or propellent precursor (2,4-DNT: 2,4- dinitrotoluene) and an aromatic compound (AαC: 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indol), respectively. Follow-up mixture tests were based on the calculated LC50 or EC50 of the single compounds and combined effects were predicted according to the mixture concepts of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). The order of toxicity for the single substances was carbendazim (LC50 = 1.25 μM) \textless AαC (LC50 = 8.16 μM) \textless 2,4-DNT (LC50 = 177.05 μM). For AαC and 2,4 DNT hypo-pigmentation was observed in addition (AαC EC50 = 1.81 μM; 2,4-DNT EC50 = 8.81 μM). Two binary and one ternary mixture were studied on lethality and one on hypo-pigmentation: 2,4-DNT/AαC (LC50 = 119.21 μM, EC50 = 5.37 μM), carbendazim/AαC (LC50 = 4.49 μM) and AαC/Carbendazim/2,4 DNT (LC50 = 108.62 μM). Results showed that the effects were in agreement with the CA model when substances were tested in mixtures. Therefore, in a reasonable worst case scenario substance combination effects in fish embryos were at maximum only prone to overestimation when using CA as the mixture concept.

TI  - Degradation evaluation and toxicity profile of bilobol, a promising eco-friendly larvicide.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main arbovirus vector transmitting chikungunya, Zika and dengue. The current vector control strategies are limited due to multiple insecticide resistance, deleterious impacts on the environment, and toxicity to non-target organisms. Bilobol, an alkylresorcinol isolated from the plant species Schinus terebinthifolia, demonstrated larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti (LC(50) 7.67 mg/L in less than 24 h). To ensure that bilobol presents a viable alternative as an eco-friendly larvicide, this study aimed to explore the degradation process and acute toxicity of this alkylresorcinol in zebrafish, a non-target organism. A quantification method with validated parameters was developed and used to evaluate bilobol degradation in water over time. The Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test was applied to evaluate the acute toxicity of bilobol together with its degradation derivates. Results demonstrated that bilobol gradually degrades over time and almost completely disappears after 96 h, turning into small aliphatic chains which are less toxic than bilobol in its fundamental form. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that bilobol does not present significant toxicity to zebrafish embryos nor does it show signs of persistence in the environment. Additionally, bilobol can be found in high quantities not only in S. terebinthifolia, but also in cashew nut industry waste. Thus, bilobol constitutes an alternative environmentally friendly insecticide because it is not persistent, has indications of low toxicity to non-target organisms and presents a way to exploit massive quantities of material discarded by the food industry.

TI  - Developmental toxicity, oxidative stress, and related gene expression induced by dioxin-like PCB 126 in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - 3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) cause multiple adverse effects in organisms including animals and humans. Although PCB toxicities are linked to oxidative damage in rodents, the mechanism in early life stages of zebrafish is not clear. To explore the developmental toxicity mechanism of PCB126, three paradigms (toxicological phenotypes, biochemical changes, and molecular changes) were studied in 3-h postfertilization (hpf) zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to different PCB126 concentrations (0, 16, 32, 64, and 128 μg/L) until 168 hpf. Developmental malformations, including pericardial and yolk sac edema, impaired lower jaw growth, spinal curvature, head edema and failure to inflate the swim bladder were observed, some as early as 72 hpf. Mortality was not apparent in early stages but significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner from 144 hpf onward. A dose-dependent significant increase in malformation rate was observed from 72 hpf onward with up to 100% at 132 hpf in embryos exposed to 128 μg/L of PCB126. Higher doses of PCB126 significantly decreased the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-Sod), catalase (Cat), and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) enzyme activities at 96, 132 hpf, but markedly declined from thereafter. PCB126 at 128 μg/L significantly increased the malondialdehyde content at 72, 96, and 132 hpf. The transcriptional gene expression of antioxidant enzymes Cat and Gpx was upregulated in embryos exposed to 64 μg/L of PCB126 at 24 and 96 hpf. Sod1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was low in embryos exposed to 32 μg/L at 72 and 96 hpf but was induced in embryos exposed to 64 and 128 μg/L doses at 132 hpf. Collectively, the results suggest oxidative stress as a major factor in the induction of multiple developmental abnormalities in early life stages of zebrafish exposed to PCB126. However, the relationship between the antioxidant enzyme activity and the mRNA expression was not clear and the potential reasons for this are discussed.

TI  - Influence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on enantioselective bioaccumulation and oxidative stress toxicity of indoxacarb in zebrafish(Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely used in various fields with the rapid development of nanotechnology. Pesticides have an irreplaceable role in agricultural production, which leads to their massive utilization and their inevitably penetrate into the aquatic environment. However, limited information is available regarding the impact of CNTs on the toxicity and enrichment of chiral compounds to organisms. Using zebrafish as a model to study whether the enantioselective bioaccumulation and oxidative stress of chiral pollutants may be altered in the presence of MWCNTs. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed in zebrafish with the preferential accumulation of R-(-)-indoxacarb during the 28-day bioaccumulation. The combined exposure of MWCNTs does not affect the enantioselectivity of zebrafish bioaccumulation, but increase the bioaccumulation amount of R-(-)-indoxacarb by 65%. Moreover, the average degradation half-life of indoxacarb enantiomers was 1.30 days. The indoxacarb causes oxidative stress toxicity in zebrafish liver and exhibited enantioselectivity, while the addition of MWCNTs did not significantly change the enantioselectivity of oxidative stress toxicity of indoxacarb, but enhanced the toxicity 20% with increased MWCNTs concentrations. This study suggests that the risk of the co-presence of nanomaterials and chiral pesticides in aquatic environments should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Forchlorfenuron (CPPU) causes disorganization of the cytoskeleton and dysfunction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and abnormal vascular development in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Forchlorfenuron (CPPU) has been used worldwide, to boost size and improve quality of various agricultural products. CPPU and its metabolites are persistent and have been detected frequently in fruits, water, sediments, and organisms in aquatic systems. Although the public became aware of CPPU through the exploding watermelon scandal of 2011 in Zhenjiang, China, little was known of its potential effects on the environment and wildlife. In this study, adverse effects of CPPU on developmental angiogenesis and vasculature, which is vulnerable to insults of persistent toxicants, were studied in vivo in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Exposure to 10 mg CPPU/L impaired survival and hatching, while development was hindered by exposure to 2.5 mg CPPU/L. Developing vascular structure, including common cardinal veins (CCVs), intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and sub-intestinal vessels (SIVs), were significantly restrained by exposure to CPPU, in a dose-dependent manner. Also, CPPU caused disorganization of the cytoskeleton. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), CPPU inhibited proliferation, migration and formation of tubular-like structures in vitro. Results of Western blot analyses revealed that exposure to CPPU increased phosphorylation of FLT-1, but inhibited phosphorylation of FAK and its downstream MAPK pathway in HUVECs. In summary, CPPU elicited developmental toxicity to the developing endothelial system of zebrafish and HUVECs. This was do, at least in part due to inhibition of the FAK/MAPK signaling pathway rather than direct interaction with the VEGF receptor (VEGFR).

TI  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles enhanced thyroid endocrine disruption of pentachlorophenol rather than neurobehavioral defects in zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - This study investigated the influences of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (n-TiO(2)) on the thyroid endocrine disruption and neurobehavioral defects induced by pentachlorophenol (PCP) in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Embryos (2 h post-fertilization) were exposed to PCP (0, 3, 10, and 30 μg/L) or in combination with n-TiO(2) (0.1 mg/L) until 6 days post-fertilization. The results showed that n-TiO(2) alone did not affect thyroid hormones levels or transcriptions of related genes. Exposure to PCP significantly decreased thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) content, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level and transcription of thyroglobulin (tg), but significantly increased 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) level and upregulation of deiodinase 2 (dio2). In comparison, the co-exposure with n-TiO(2) significantly reduced the content of T3 by depressing the potential targets, tg and dio2. For neurotoxicity, the single and co-exposure resulted in similar effects with significant downregulation of neurodevelopment-related genes (ELAV like RNA Binding Protein 3, elavl3; Growth associated protein-43, gap43; α-tubulin) and inhibited locomotor activity. The results indicated that the presence of n-TiO(2) significantly enhanced the PCP-induced thyroid endocrine disruption but not the neurobehavioral defects in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Organophosphorus-based chemical additives induced behavioral changes in zebrafish (Danio rerio): Swimming activity is a sensitive stress indicator.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - Organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) have been extensively used as chemical additives in polymer based consumer products. Among them, Isopropylphenyl phosphate (IPPP) and tripropyl phosphate (TPP) are predominant, which have potential to cause neuro-toxic effects on non-target organisms. As behavior (swimming activity) response is the first adjustment due to neurotoxic stress on the fitness of fish. In this study, the quantified swimming activity of zebrafish (Danio rerio) under IPPP and TPP exposure in an online monitoring system was investigated to assess the neurotoxin effects under long-term exposure periods, no swimming anomalies were observed in the control group. Whereas, in the OPFR exposures ((treatment I: 5 μg/L and treatment II: 25 μg/L), a series of anomalies were identified. Hyperactivity was shown in IPPP treatment I group (5 μg/L), whereas zebrafish swimming activity was declined throughout the study period in IPPP treatment II (25 μg/L), and TPP groups (5 μg/L and 25 μg/L) when compared to the control group. Circadian rhythm was not affected in the present study. The results of the present study indicated that the fitness of test individuals was a valid biomarker for eco-toxicity assessment under unescapable conditions. Hypoactivity of zebrafish signified the neurotoxic effects of IPPP and TPP. A concentration based improvement in swimming activity was observed under recovery conditions, which suggested that recovery capacity along with toxicity responses could be a comprehensive non-invasive technique to assess the eco-toxicity of waterborne chemicals.

TI  - Rescue of Pink1 Deficiency by Stress-Dependent Activation of Autophagy.
T2  - Cell chemical biology
AB  - Stimulating autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Neurons are insensitive to current approaches based on mTOR inhibition for activating autophagy, and instead may rely on the Parkinson's disease-associated proteins PINK1 and PARKIN to activate the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in response to mitochondrial damage. We developed a multifactorial zebrafish drug-screening platform combining Pink1 deficiency with an environmental toxin to compromise mitochondrial function and trigger dopaminergic neuron loss. Using a phenotypic screening strategy, we identified a series of piperazine phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, which rescued Pink1 deficiency by activating autophagy selectively in stressed zebrafish and human cells. We show that trifluoperazine acts downstream of, or parallel to, PINK1/PARKIN to stimulate transcription factor EB nuclear translocation and the expression of autophagy-lysosomal target genes. These data suggest that stress-dependent pharmacological reactivation of autophagy could prevent the loss of vulnerable neurons to slow neurodegeneration.

TI  - Arsenic alters behavioral parameters and brain ectonucleotidases activities in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Arsenic (As) exposure has been associated with serious chronic health risk to humans including cancer and neurological disturbances. However, there are limited studies about the mechanisms behind its toxicity. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to several concentrations of As (0.05, 5, and 15 mg As/L; Na(2)HAsO(4) as As(V)) during 96 h to evaluate the zebrafish locomotor activity, anxiety, and brain extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis. We showed that 5 mg/L As is able to promote significant decrease in the locomotor activity as evaluated by the number of line crossings. In addition, animals treated with 5mg/L As presented an increase in time spent in the lower zone of the tank test, suggesting an anxiogenic effect. Considering that behavioral parameters, such as anxiety and locomotion, might be modulated by the purinergic system, we also evaluated the ectonucleotidase activities in zebrafish brain after a 96-h As exposure. A significant decrease in ATP, ADP, and AMP hydrolysis was observed at 0.05, 5, and 15 mg/L when compared to control group. These findings demonstrated that As might affect behavioral parameters and the ectonucleotidase activities in zebrafish, suggesting this enzyme pathway is a target for neurotoxic effects induced by As.

TI  - Systemic Stereoselectivity Study of Etoxazole: Stereoselective Bioactivity, Acute Toxicity, and Environmental Behavior in Fruits and Soils.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - This is the first systemic assessment of the stereoselectivity of etoxazole enantiomers. Etoxazole's stereoselective bioactivity was assessed against target organisms ( Tetranychus urticae eggs and Tetranychus cinnabarinus eggs), and its acute toxicity was assessed toward nontarget aquatic organisms ( Daphnia magna and Danio rerio). Additionally, stereoselective elimination was investigated in three species of fruits (grape and strawberry grown in a greenhouse and apple grown in an open field) and in field soil. The ovicidal activity of (+)-( S)-etoxazole against Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus cinnabarinus eggs was about 16 and 24 times higher, respectively, than that of (-)-( R)-etoxazole. Inconsistent order of etoxazole isomer toxicity was found toward different aquatic organisms: (+)-( S)-etoxazole showed nearly 8.7 times higher acute toxicity than (-)-( R)-etoxazole toward Daphnia magna, whereas (-)-( R)-etoxazole was ∼4.5 times more toxic to Danio rerio than (+)-( S)-etoxazole. Stereoselective degradation of etoxazole enantiomers showed significant variation in various fruits and field soil. The (+)-( S)-etoxazole was preferentially dissipated in grape and strawberry fruits grown under greenhouse condition, whereas (-)-( R)-etoxazole degraded faster than its antipode in apple fruits and soils under open-field condition. Overall, the stereoselectivity of etoxazole enantiomers should be fully considered in comprehensive environmental health risk in future work.

TI  - Aclonifen causes developmental abnormalities in zebrafish embryos through mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The herbicide aclonifen is commonly used in agriculture. Aclonifen is toxic to experimental animals, causing developmental abnormalities, decreased energy production for survival, and impaired organogenesis. However, no studies have reported the functional defects and toxicity caused by aclonifen in embryonic development. We hypothesized that the mechanism underlying the toxicity of several herbicides in various organisms involves mitochondrial dysfunction, which subsequently promotes genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and acute organotoxicity. In the present study, we demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction during development results in decreased body length, delayed yolk sac absorption, malformed spinal cord, disrupted brain and eye formation, and the activation of apoptosis in zebrafish embryos. Aclonifen induced oxidative stress by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species, causing mitochondrial damage. Likewise, impaired embryonic vascularization can promote cardiovascular disorders. In this study, we characterized the toxicity of aclonifen in a non-target organism. These findings increase our understanding of the toxicological effects of herbicides in unexpected environments.

TI  - Effects of nanoplastic on toxicity of azole fungicides (ketoconazole and fluconazole) in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The ubiquity of nanoplastics (NPs) raises concerns about their interactions and combined toxicity with other common contaminants. Although azoles are present throughout the natural environment, their interactions with NP are not well known. We investigated the effects of polystyrene (PS) NP on the toxicity of ketoconazole (KCZ) and fluconazole (FCZ) in zebrafish embryos using the developmental toxicity, oxidative-stress-related biochemical parameters, and expression of genes related to neurotoxicity (ache), cardiotoxicity (gata4, bmp4), inflammation (il1b), oxidative stress (sod1, sod2, cyp1a), and apoptosis (bax, bcl2). Co-exposure to NP (1 mg/L) and KCZ/FCZ (1 mg/L) for 96 h reduced the hatching rate, survival rate, and heart rate and increased the malformation rate and catalase activity. The bax/bcl2 ratio, an apoptosis indicator, was higher after NP, KCZ, or FCZ treatment. However, the bax/bcl2 ratio after exposure to NP + KCZ or NP + FCZ was much higher than that after single exposure. Overall, the results indicated that NP aggravated the toxicity of azole by significantly increasing the reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and altering the expression of oxidative-stress- and apoptosis-related genes. The interactive toxicity of PS NP with KCZ/FCZ reported in this study emphasises the need for caution in the release of azole fungicides in the environment.

TI  - The sonic hedgehog signaling pathway is suppressed following PCB(1254) exposure during retinal development.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) has been reported to have detrimental effects on retinal development. In order to explore the role of Shh signaling in retinal development after PCB(1254) exposure in vivo and in vitro, zebrafish and RGC-5 retinal cell line were used. Compared with the controls, PCB exposure inhibited proliferation and increased the apoptosis levels. The expression of Shh mRNA decreased in the PCB(1254) -treated groups both in vivo and in vitro compared with that of the controls. The ptch2 mRNA expression increased in the experimental groups. The expression of gli2 mRNA decreased in the PCB(1254) -treated groups. Immunofluorescence and western blotting assays confirmed that the expression of Shh proteins decreased in PCB(1254) -treated groups compared with control groups. Moreover, ptch2 protein levels increased in the PCB(1254) -treated groups as well as the decreased protein expressions of gli1 and gli2. These results demonstrated that Shh signaling pathway may participate in the damage of retinal development caused by PCB(1254) exposure, providing evidence that eye diseases could be caused by environmental pollutants.

TI  - Disruption of Cxcr3 chemotactic signaling alters lysosomal function and renders macrophages more microbicidal.
T2  - Cell reports
AB  - Chemotaxis and lysosomal function are closely intertwined processes essential for the inflammatory response and clearance of intracellular bacteria. We used the zebrafish model to examine the link between chemotactic signaling and lysosome physiology in macrophages during mycobacterial infection and wound-induced inflammation in vivo. Macrophages from zebrafish larvae carrying a mutation in a chemokine receptor of the Cxcr3 family display upregulated expression of vesicle trafficking and lysosomal genes and possess enlarged lysosomes that enhance intracellular bacterial clearance. This increased microbicidal capacity is phenocopied by inhibiting the lysosomal transcription factor EC, while its overexpression counteracts the protective effect of chemokine receptor mutation. Tracking macrophage migration in zebrafish revealed that lysosomes of chemokine receptor mutants accumulate in the front half of cells, preventing macrophage polarization during chemotaxis and reaching sites of inflammation. Our work shows that chemotactic signaling affects the bactericidal properties and localization during chemotaxis, key aspects of the inflammatory response.

TI  - Oxidative stress intensity-related effects of cadmium (Cd) and paraquat (PQ) on UV-damaged-DNA binding and excision repair activities in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Our earlier studies showed the inhibitory effects of cadmium (Cd) and paraquat (PQ) on the gene expression of DNA mismatch recognition proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study explored the effects of Cd and PQ on nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity in zebrafish embryos. Exposure of embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to 3-5 μM Cd or 30-100 μM PQ for 9 h induced a 2-3-fold increase of oxidative stress, while a 6.5-fold increase of oxidative stress was induced by 200 μM PQ. Real-time RT-PCR detected a down-regulated xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) and an up-regulated UV-DDB2 gene expression in mildly-stressed embryos, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene expression increased with PQ exposure levels. NER of UV-damaged DNA was enhanced in weakly oxidant-stressed embryos as shown by a transcription-based DNA repair assay, yet repair activities of both UV and cisplatin-damaged DNA were inhibited in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ. Band shift assay showed a suppression of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) binding activity in all stressed embryos. In contrast, (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP) recognition activity was weakly stimulated except in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ, revealing a link of NER capacity to 6-4PP binding. Our results showed that Cd and PQ imposed similar inducing effects on UV-DDB2 gene expression, NER of UV-damaged DNA and 6-4PP binding activity in zebrafish embryo under low levels of oxidative stress and NER capacity could be inhibited if the intensity of oxidative stress increased to a critical level.

TI  - Direct analysis of metabolites in the liver tissue of zebrafish exposed to fiproles by internal extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
T2  - The Analyst
AB  - Exploring the metabolic disturbance of fipronil and its derivatives in aquatic organisms may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of fipronil on the ecological environment. In this work, internal extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (iEESI-MS) was used to directly analyze metabolites in the liver tissue of zebrafish exposed to fipronil and its three derivatives. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that 32 signals were considered as differential signals in zebrafish after the exposure treatment of fipronil and its derivatives, including phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), fatty acids and so on. The pathway analysis result showed that both fipronil and its derivatives have a significant impact on the glycerophospholipid metabolism of zebrafish. Besides, the intensities of PC signals in the liver samples of each group showed such a trend: mixed fiprole exposed group \textgreater fipronil sulfone exposed group ≈ fipronil sulfide exposed group \textgreater fipronil exposed group \textgreater fipronil desulfinyl exposed group \textgreater control group, indicating that mixed exposure of fipronil and its derivatives exhibited more significant metabolic disturbance in zebrafish. Taken together, iEESI-MS is applied to environmental toxicology and investigating the metabolic disturbance induced by fipronil and its derivatives in aquatic organisms, providing a new analytical method for this field.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of developmental toxicities of azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin toward zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos: Visualization of abnormal development using two transgenic lines.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Azoxystrobin (AZ) and pyraclostrobin (PY) are strobilurin fungicides that inhibit fungal mitochondrial respiration. In this study, a representative model, zebrafish (Danio rerio), was used as a test species for acute and developmental toxicity. Survival and malformation rates were observed only PY-treated embryos, with an LC(50) value of 77.75 ppb accompanied by a dramatic decrease in hatching rate, while AZ did not show great mortality. Morphological changes were observed in PY-treated embryos with the occurrence of pericadial edema at 25 ppb. A delay in growth was observed after treatment with pyraclostrobin at 50 ppb. Use of genetically engineered Tg(cmlc:EGFP) allowed fluorescence observation during heart development. PY interfered with normal heart development via upregulation of the nppa gene responsible for the expression of natriuretic peptides. Heart function was dramatically reduced as indicated by reduced heart rates. Increased expression of the nppa gene was also seen in AZ-treated embryos. The expression level of cyp24a1 was also up-regulated, while ugt1a1 and sult1st6 were down-regulated after treatment of zebrafish embryos with AZ or PY. Overall, strobilurin fungicides might inhibit normal heart formation and function within the range of concentrations tested.

TI  - Organophosphate pesticides induce morphological abnormalities and decrease locomotor activity and heart rate in Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Organophosphate pesticides (OPs), a class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, are used widely in agriculture to reduce insect populations. Because of the conservation of acetylcholinesterase between invertebrates and vertebrates, OPs also can adversely affect nontarget species, such as aquatic and terrestrial animals. This study used uniform conditions to analyze the morphological and physiological effects caused by developmental exposure to 3 commonly used OPs-chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, and diazinon-on 2 aquatic vertebrate species, Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Xenopus laevis. Survival, locomotor activity, heart rate, and gross anatomical abnormalities, including kyphosis and edema, were observed over a 5-d period in response to OP concentrations ranging from 0 µM to 1000 µM. Both zebrafish and Xenopus showed decreased survival for all 3 OPs at higher concentrations. However, Xenopus showed higher mortality than zebrafish at lower chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos concentrations. Both models showed a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate and free-swimming larval activity in response to chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. In addition, kyphosis and decreased spine length were prominent in Xenopus in response to 10 µM of chlorpyrifos and 0.1 µM dichlorvos. Although diazinon induced no effects on skeletal and cardiac motor activity in either species, it did induce cardiac edemas in zebrafish. Differences in the biological actions of OPs and their differential effects in these 2 vertebrate models demonstrate the importance of using common protocols and multiple models to evaluate the ecotoxicology of OPs.

TI  - A systems toxicology approach to elucidate the mechanisms involved in RDX species-specific sensitivity.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Interspecies uncertainty factors in ecological risk assessment provide conservative estimates of risk where limited or no toxicity data is available. We quantitatively examined the validity of interspecies uncertainty factors by comparing the responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to the energetic compound 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), a known neurotoxicant. Relative toxicity was measured through transcriptional, morphological, and behavioral end points in zebrafish and fathead minnow fry exposed for 96 h to RDX concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 27.7 mg/L. Spinal deformities and lethality occurred at 1.8 and 3.5 mg/L RDX respectively for fathead minnow and at 13.8 and 27.7 mg/L for zebrafish, indicating that zebrafish have an 8-fold greater tolerance for RDX than fathead minnow fry. The number and magnitude of differentially expressed transcripts increased with increasing RDX concentration for both species. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in functions related to neurological disease, oxidative-stress, acute-phase response, vitamin/mineral metabolism and skeletal/muscular disorders. Decreased expression of collagen-coding transcripts were associated with spinal deformity and likely involved in sensitivity to RDX. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for species-specific sensitivity to RDX where zebrafish responded at lower concentrations with greater numbers of functions related to RDX tolerance than fathead minnow. While the 10-fold interspecies uncertainty factor does provide a reasonable cross-species estimate of toxicity in the present study, the observation that the responses between ZF and FHM are markedly different does initiate a call for concern regarding establishment of broad ecotoxicological conclusions based on model species such as zebrafish.

TI  - Insights into the combined effects of environmental concentration of difenoconazole and tebuconazole on zebrafish early life stage.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Limited literature had focused on the combined effect of triazole fungicides on aquatic organisms at environmental concentrations. In this research, difenoconazole (DIF) and tebuconazole (TEB) mixture exhibited additive effect on the acute toxicity to zebrafish embryos. The transcriptomics and metabolomics demonstrated DIF and TEB mixtures at aquatic life benchmark and environmental concentration simultaneously influenced the lipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism, but showed diverse response patterns mediating the combined effects on zebrafish embryos after 120 h exposure. The DIF and TEB mixture at aquatic life benchmark caused combined effect on yolk sac resorption and metabolites, was less than the additive effect of individual DIF and TEB. It was found environmental concentration of DIF and TEB caused much lower levels of IFN and IL6, induced higher levels of PGE(2), l-kynurenine and formylanthranilate in zebrafish larvae, and their binary mixture caused synergistic effect on the accumulation of metabolites in metabolic pathways, which might cause more negative effect and risk on growth in zebrafish later life stages. Results further demonstrated that adding arachidonic acid (AA) increased the transcripts of Pla(2), Ptgs1, Cyp19a and Cxcl8b, allayed the accumulation of PLA(2) and 17β-E(2), and induced more PGF2α, IFN and IL6 levels in zebrafish larvae, indicated AA metabolism might play important regulatory roles on hormone synthesis and immune response caused by DIF and TEB mixtures. Current results indicated the risk assessment of mixtures based on single concentration may not precisely estimate the environmental risk and health effect, it is crucially important to consider the multi-concentration combinations, and more attention should be paid to the environmental concentration.

TI  - Binding difference of fipronil with GABAARs in fruitfly and zebrafish: insights from homology modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - Fipronil, which targets GABAA receptors (GABAARs), is the first phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used in crop protection and public hygiene. However, its high toxicity on fishes greatly limited its applications. In the present study, a series of computational methods including homology modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were integrated to explore the binding difference of fipronil with GABAARs from fruitfly and zebrafish systems. It was found that, in the zebrafish system, the H-bond between 6'Thr and fipronil exerted key effects on the recognition of fipronil, which was absent in the fruitfly system. On the other hand, in the fruitfly system, strong electrostatic interaction between 2'Ala and fipronil was favorable to the binding of fipronil but detrimental to the binding in the zebrafish system. These findings marked the binding difference of fipronil with different GABAARs, which might be helpful in designing selective insecticides against pests instead of fishes.

TI  - High-throughput preparation of radioprotective polymers via Hantzsch's reaction for in vivo X-ray damage determination.
T2  - Nature communications
AB  - Radioprotectors for acute injuries caused by large doses of ionizing radiation are vital to national security, public health and future development of humankind. Here, we develop a strategy to explore safe and efficient radioprotectors by combining Hantzsch's reaction, high-throughput methods and polymer chemistry. A water-soluble polymer with low-cytotoxicity and an excellent anti-radiation capability has been achieved. In in vivo experiments, this polymer is even better than amifostine, which is the only approved radioprotector for clinical applications, in effectively protecting zebrafish embryos from fatally large doses of ionizing radiation (80 Gy X-ray). A mechanistic study also reveals that the radioprotective ability of this polymer originates from its ability to efficiently prevent DNA damage due to high doses of radiation. This is an initial attempt to explore polymer radioprotectors via a multi-component reaction. It allows exploiting functional polymers and provides the underlying insights to guide the design of radioprotective polymers.

TI  - Determination and prediction of the binding interaction between organophosphate flame retardants and p53.
T2  - Chemical research in toxicology
AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have caused widespread concern because of the harm to the environment. In this study, to better explain the mechanism for the binding of OPFRs with the tumor suppressor gene p53, an integrated experimental and in silico approach was used. The binding constants of 10 OPFRs were measured by surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR). The effect of OPFRs on p53 gene and protein expression in ZF4 cells was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation were explored to find that the H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions were the dominant interaction between OPFRs and p53. On the basis of the observed interactions, proper molecular structural descriptors were used to build the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The current QSAR model provided robustness, predictive ability, and mechanism interpretability. The applicability domain of the QSAR was discussed by the Williams plot. The results showed that H-bonds and electrostatic interaction governed the binding affinities between OPFRs and p53.

TI  - Differential protein profile in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain under the joint exposure of methyl parathion and cadmium.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - As different chemicals, methyl parathion (MP) and cadmium (Cd) can induce neurotoxicity on the brain of aquatic ecosystems. This study aims to explore the differential expression proteins in the brain induced by their joint stress and their joint effects, which are poorly reported, and devotes finding novel biomarkers for monitoring their contamination in water and assessing their neurological effects. The bioaccumulation of MP and Cd in tissues after 96 h of exposure was first analyzed by GC and inductively coupled plasma-MS to provide insights into the interaction. Protein profile changes in the brains of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to MP and Cd were further investigated using the proteomic approach. The correlation of gene expression on the transcription level of mRNA and the translation level of protein was examined by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis. It showed that Cd and MP have an interaction on their bioaccumulation, which suggests that their joint effect over 96 h might be antagonistic. Proteomics revealed that 22 protein spots changed their expression levels under stress, of which 16 proteins were identified using MS. These proteins were involved in oxidation/reduction, metabolism, energy production, receptor activity, and cytoskeleton assembly. Among them, five proteins with a remarkable abundance change are significantly suggested to play important roles in the joint effect. This work demonstrates that there exists an interaction between MP and Cd toxicities, which may aid in our understanding of the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by joint stress. The results may also provide the possibility of the establishment of candidate biomarkers for monitoring MP and Cd contamination in water.

TI  - Maternal-to-zygotic transition as a potential target for niclosamide during early embryogenesis.
T2  - Toxicology and applied pharmacology
AB  - Niclosamide is an antihelminthic drug used worldwide for the treatment of tapeworm infections. Recent drug repurposing screens have highlighted the broad bioactivity of niclosamide across diverse mechanisms of action. As a result, niclosamide is being evaluated for a range of alternative drug-repurposing applications, including the treatment of cancer, bacterial infections, and Zika virus. As new applications of niclosamide will require non-oral delivery routes that may lead to exposure in utero, it is important to understand the mechanism of niclosamide toxicity during early stages of embryonic development. Previously, we showed that niclosamide induces a concentration-dependent delay in epiboly progression in the absence of effects on oxidative phosphorylation - a well-established target for niclosamide. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to further examine the mechanism of niclosamide-induced epiboly delay during zebrafish embryogenesis. Based on this study, we found that (1) niclosamide exposure during early zebrafish embryogenesis resulted in a decrease in yolk sac integrity with a concomitant decrease in the presence of yolk sac actin networks and increase in cell size; (2) within whole embryos, niclosamide exposure did not alter non-polar metabolites and lipids, but significantly altered amino acids specific to aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; (3) niclosamide significantly altered transcripts related to translation, transcription, and mRNA processing pathways; and (4) niclosamide did not significantly alter levels of rRNA and tRNA. Overall, our findings suggest that niclosamide may be causing a systemic delay in embryonic development by disrupting the translation of maternally-supplied mRNAs, an effect that may be mediated through disruption of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.

TI  - Modeling acetylcholine esterase inhibition resulting from exposure to a mixture of atrazine and chlorpyrifos using a physiologically-based kinetic model in fish.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Aquatic organisms are exposed to mixtures of chemicals that may interact. Mixtures of atrazine (ATR) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) may elicit synergic effects on the permanent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in certain aquatic organisms, causing severe damage. Mechanistic mathematical models of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (TD) may be used to better characterize and understand the interactions of these two chemicals. In this study, a previously published generic physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model for fish was adapted to ATR and CPF. A sub-model of the kinetics of one of the main metabolites of CPF, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-oxon), was included, as well as a TD model. Inhibition of two esterases, AChE and carboxylesterase, by ATR, CPF and CPF-oxon, was modeled using TD modeling of quantities of total and inactive esterases. Specific attention was given to the parameterization and calibration of the model to accurately predict the concentration and effects observed in the fish using Bayesian inference and published data from fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). A PBTK-TD for mixtures was used to predict dose-response relationships for comparison with available adult fish data. Synergistic effects of a joint exposure to ATR and CPF could not be demonstrated in adult fish.

TI  - Aroclor 1254 and BDE-47 inhibit dopaminergic function manifesting as changes in locomotion behaviors in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the environment is a major concern due to their persistent bioaccumulative toxicity that can disturb neurobehavioral functions including movements. Recently, it was reported that some PBDE including BDE-47 stimulates locomotor activities of zebrafish embryos by unknown mechanism. In this study, motor movements of the zebrafish embryo were used as a model system to evaluate the neuronal toxicity of a non-coplanar PCB-dominant mixture (Aroclor 1254) and BDE-47. Both organohalogens increased tail shaking and rotation of embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. Chemical inhibition and gene knock-down of tyrosine hydroxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) also induced hyperactivities. Hyperactivities induced by these treatments were all inhibited by supplementation of l-tyrosine and l-dopa, precursors of dopamine synthesis. Both organohalogens reduced dopamine contents and increased the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/dopamine ratio in whole embryos. The results suggest that functional inhibition of dopaminergic neurons is involved in hyperactivities of zebrafish embryos caused by Aroclor 1254 and BDE-47.

TI  - Toxicity effects of profenofos on embryonic and larval development of Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of profenofos to early developing Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (4h post fertilization) in a static system at 1.0 to 2.25mg/L. Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of profenofos at 24-h, 48-h, 72-h and 96-h were determined as 2.04, 1.58, 1.57 and 1.56 mg/L, respectively. The hatching of embryos were recorded at every 12h interval and the median hatching time (HT50) was also calculated for each concentration. In a separate set of experiments, 96-h LC10 (0.74 mg/L) and LC50 (1.56 mg/L) concentrations were used to assess the developmental toxicity in relation to behavior, morphology, and interactions with the targeted enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Live video-microscopy revealed that the profenofos exposed embryos exhibited an abnormal development, skeletal defects and altered heart morphology in a concentration-dependent manner, which leads to alterations in the swimming behavior of hatchlings at 144-h, which indicate that developing zebrafish are sensitive to profenofos.

TI  - Parental co-exposure to bisphenol A and nano-TiO(2) causes thyroid endocrine disruption and developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish offspring.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The coexistence of organic toxicants and nanoparticles in the environment influences pollutant bioavailability and toxicity. Using chronic co-exposure to an adult zebrafish model, this study investigated the transfer kinetics and transgenerational effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (n-TiO(2)) exposure in F1 offspring. When single and combined exposure to BPA (0, 2, and 20 μg/L) and n-TiO(2) (100 μg/L) were compared, combined exposure was found to reciprocally facilitate bioaccumulation in adult fish while enhancing maternal transfer to offspring. Thyroid endocrine disruption and developmental neurotoxicity were observed in larval offspring by parental exposure to BPA alone or in combination with n-TiO(2). Exposure to 20 μg/L BPA significantly decreased the thyroxine (T4) concentration in adult plasma, leading to less transfer into the eggs. The presence of 20 μg/L BPA with n-TiO(2) further decreased the level of T4 compared to BPA exposure alone. Additionally, offspring larvae derived from exposed parents exhibited lethargic swimming behavior. Overall, this study examined the interactions of BPA and n-TiO(2) with regard to their bioaccumulation, maternal transfer, and developmental effects, which highlighted that co-exposure dynamics are important and need to be considered for accurate environmental risk assessment.

TI  - In vivo cardiovascular toxicity induced by acetochlor in zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The risk of acetochlor to human health is still unclear, prompting concern over its risk, especially to pesticide suicides population, occupational population (farmers, retailers and pharmaceutical workers), and special population (young children and infants, pregnant women, older people, and those with compromised immune systems). This study was to explore the toxic effect and the possible mechanism of toxic action of acetochlor using zebrafish larvae whose toxicity profiles have been confirmed to be strikingly similar with mammalian. The result indicated that the toxic target organ of acetochlor was cardiovascular system. Thus, cardiovascular toxicity evaluation was investigated systematically. The main phenotypes of cardiovascular toxicity induced by acetochlor were bradycardia, pericardial edema, circulation defect, and thrombosis; Malformed heart was confirmed by histopathological examination. Thrombosis which maybe triggered by bradycardia was further studied using o-dianisidine for erythrocyte staining; Substantial thrombus in the caudal vein and significantly reduced heart red blood cells (RBCs) intensity which can reflect the thrombosis degree were observed in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the mRNA expression level of Nkx2.5 and Gata4 related to induction of cardiac program were down-regulated significantly by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which could cause defects in the cardiovascular system. For the first time, our results demonstrated that acetochlor induced cardiovascular toxicity, and down-regulation of Nkx2.5 and Gata4 might be its possible molecular basis. Our data generated here might provide novel insights into cardiovascular disease risk following acetochlor exposure to human, especially to pesticide suicides population, occupational population and special population.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the regenerative and mineralogenic performances of the zebrafish caudal fin.
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - The ability of zebrafish to fully regenerate its caudal fin has been explored to better understand the mechanisms underlying de novo bone formation and to develop screening methods towards the discovery of compounds with therapeutic potential. Quantifying caudal fin regeneration largely depends on successfully measuring new tissue formation through methods that require optimization and standardization. Here, we present an improved methodology to characterize and analyse overall caudal fin and bone regeneration in adult zebrafish. First, regenerated and mineralized areas are evaluated through broad, rapid and specific chronological and morphometric analysis in alizarin red stained fins. Then, following a more refined strategy, the intensity of the staining within a 2D longitudinal plane is determined through pixel intensity analysis, as an indicator of density or thickness/volume. The applicability of this methodology on live specimens, to reduce animal experimentation and provide a tool for in vivo tracking of the regenerative process, was successfully demonstrated. Finally, the methodology was validated on retinoic acid- and warfarin-treated specimens, and further confirmed by micro-computed tomography. Because it is easily implementable, accurate and does not require sophisticated equipment, the present methodology will certainly provide valuable technical standardization for research in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and skeletal biology.

TI  - Analysis of neurobehavioural data by chemometric methods in ecotoxicological studies.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Incorporation of chemometric tools in behavioural data management workflows allows for the early identification of most relevant endpoints complementarily to statistical confirmatory approaches. In this work, the effects of two model neurotoxicants, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and nicotine, exposures on behavioural profiles of adult zebrafish at three different times (2, 6 and 24h) were evaluated using open field test (OFT) paradigm experiments. Two chemometric methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Analysis of Variance-Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) have been used to interpret the changes observed in the obtained behavioural data. A decreased of the locomotor activity, an anxiolytic effect and an altered exploratory behaviour were the most affected behavioural endpoints in the CPF exposures. However, an increase of the locomotor activity and an anxiogenic effect were observed in the nicotine exposures. Finally, an excellent correlation between the ASCA results and the results obtained using traditional statistical procedures for both compounds were encountered.

TI  - Multilevel assessment of ivermectin effects using different zebrafish life stages.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Several studies have shown high toxicity of the veterinary pharmaceutical ivermectin (a semisynthetic avermectin) for aquatic invertebrates however, few data is found for fish species. The present study evaluated the toxicity of ivermectin, to embryos, juveniles, and adults of zebrafish at different levels of biological organization including developmental, behavioural and biochemical. Toxicity tests were performed based on OECD protocols and mortality and behavioural changes were assed for all stages. Biochemical responses were assessed in adults and embryos and included cholinesterases (ChEs), catalase (CAT) (only in embryos), glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and vitellogenin (VTG) like proteins (only in embryos). Genotoxicity was evaluated in adults. Results showed a higher sensitivity of juvenile and adults of zebrafish (96h-LC10 values of 14.0 and 55.4μg/L, respectively). For embryos a 96h-LC10 of 147.1μg/L was calculated, moreover developmental anomalies and hatching inhibition were observed only at high concentrations (\textgreater400μg/L), whereas biochemical and behavioural responses occurred at lower concentrations (\textless60μg/L). Behavioural responses (lethargy) occurred in all life stages. Biochemical responses were observed including the inhibition of GST in adults and changes in ChE, CAT, LDH activities and VTG levels in embryos. Ivermectin did not show to be genotoxic for adult fish. The species sensitivity distribution analysis, based on fish and invertebrate species, indicated a Hazardous Concentration for 5% of the population (HC5) value of 0.057μg/L; suggesting high sensitivity of both groups to ivermectin and a high risk of this compound to aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Graphene oxide nanosheets mitigate the developmental toxicity of TDCIPP in zebrafish via activating the mitochondrial respiratory chain and energy metabolism.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO), a novel two-dimension carbon nanomaterial, has showed tremendous potential for utilization in intelligent manufacturing and environmental protection. In parallel, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) is widely distributed in the water environment and represents a great threat to ecosystem health. However, the related knowledge remained absent regarding the impact of GO on the biological risks of TDCIPP. Herein, GO significantly reduced the mortality and malformation rates of zebrafish induced by TDCIPP maximumly by 28.6% and 41.8%, respectively. Decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) enzyme and ATP activity induced by TDCIPP were mitigated by GO. Integrating proteomics and metabolomics revealed TDCIPP obviously induced the downregulation of the proteins and metabolites involved in the cytoskeleton, mitochondrial function, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, and the TCA cycle, but the alterations were attenuated by GO. GO primarily promoted MRC activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and fatty acid β-oxidation, thus activating the energy metabolism of zebrafish and leading to antagonistic effects on the developmental toxicity of TDCIPP. These results provide a novel view on the co-exposure of GO with other pollutants and promote the reconsideration of the environmental risks of GO.

TI  - Effects of cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua isolates and cell free culture media on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo development.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The toxic effects of several species of fresh water cyanobacteria, notably Microcystis species and associated toxins, the microcystins, Anabaena species (anatoxin), Nodularia sp. (nodularin), and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (cylindrospermopsin), are well known. Little, however, is known about the effects of secondary metabolites other than alkaloids. Early life stage tests with zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to detect bioactive properties of compounds released by healthy cyanobacteria (Fischerella ambigua), particularly on the early developmental stages of fish. This approach, using F. ambigua is probably most valuable as it shows the toxicity of healthy growing cyanobacteria. The effects of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites on the embryonic stages of fish are of considerable interest as many aquatic creatures, particularly fish, are unable to avoid the potential toxins that may be released by undesirable algal blooms or as a result of allelopathic effects. In the current study, the zebrafish (D. rerio) was used as a model experimental system to investigate the effects of ambigols A and C, tjipanazole D and C, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, cell free culture media, and media extracts of a terrestrial/fresh water strain of the cyanobacterium F. ambigua on embryo development. Fish embryo tests performed with the cell free culture medium showed that after 3h of exposure to undiluted culture medium all fish embryos died. At a tenfold dilution the process of epiboly (formation of the gastrula) was retarded in all embryos, lesions were observed, and their general development was significantly arrested, finally followed by death. The same tests performed with extracts (dichloromethane, n-butanol, and residual cell free culture medium) of the cell free culture medium, ambigol A, ambigol C, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and tjipanazole D showed only ambigol A to have an influence on zebrafish development at concentrations\textgreateror=1 mg/l (2.06 microM). After 55 h all embryos showed pectoral oedema, irregularly shaped fin folds, bent tails, and unusual circular neoplasms in the dorsal tail fin fold. Due to the high concentration of ambigol A used in this assay these effects were considered to be of minor importance when compared to those of the culture medium.

TI  - Peptidomic analysis of zebrafish embryos exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls and their impact on eye development.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a class of persistent organic pollutant, are closely related to abnormal eye development in children. However, little is known regarding the role of peptides in the development of PCB-induced ocular dysplasia. To characterize the nature of PCB exposure on peptides involved in the development of the ocular system, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to detect differential expression of peptides between normal and PCB-exposed zebrafish embryos. A total of 7900 peptides were analyzed, 90 of which were differentially expressed, with 29 being up-regulated and 61 down-regulated. These peptides were investigated using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and gene ontology (GO) analysis to explore their role in eye development. This study identified 18 peptides associated with the development of the optic nerve and ocular system in the PCB-exposure group, as well as 10 peptides that are located in the functional domain of their precursor proteins. These peptides provide potential biomarkers for the treatment of ocular dysplasia caused by PCBs and may help us understand the mechanism of abnormal eye development caused by organic pollutants.

TI  - Cadmium(Cd)-induced oxidative stress down-regulates the gene expression of DNA mismatch recognition proteins MutS homolog 2 (MSH2) and MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - DNA mismatch repair (MMR) of simple base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 (MSH2)-MSH6 heterodimer to mismatched DNA. Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2, MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), d-mannitol or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 μM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM. Hence, Cd at sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Sp1). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos.

TI  - Disruption of Nuclear Receptor Signaling Alters Triphenyl Phosphate-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Zebrafish Embryos.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is an unsubstituted aryl phosphate ester used as a flame retardant and plasticizer within the United States. Using zebrafish as a model, the objectives of this study were to rely on (1) mRNA-sequencing to uncover pathways disrupted following embryonic TPHP exposure and (2) high-content screening to identify nuclear receptor ligands that enhance or mitigate TPHP-induced cardiotoxicity. Based on mRNA-sequencing, TPHP exposure from 24 to 72-h postfertilization (hpf) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the number of transcripts significantly affected at 72 hpf, and pathway analysis revealed that 5 out of 9 nuclear receptor pathways were associated with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Based on a screen of 74 unique nuclear receptor ligands as well as follow-up experiments, 2 compounds-ciglitazone (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, or PPARγ, agonist) and fenretinide (a pan-retinoic acid receptor, or RAR, agonist)-reliably mitigated TPHP-induced cardiotoxicity in the absence of effects on TPHP uptake or metabolism. As these data suggested that TPHP may be activating RXR (a heterodimer for both RARs and PPARγ), we coexposed embryos to HX 531-a pan-RXR antagonist-from 24 to 72 hpf and, contrary to our hypothesis, found that coexposure to HX 531 significantly enhanced TPHP-induced cardiotoxicity. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we also found that TPHP did not activate nor inhibit chimeric human RXRα, RXRβ, or RXRγ, suggesting that TPHP does not directly bind nor interact with RXRs. Overall, our data suggest that TPHP may interfere with RXR-dependent pathways involved in cardiac development.

TI  - Sub-chronic carbendazim exposure induces hepatic glycolipid metabolism disorder accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis in adult zebrafish (Daino rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Carbendazim (CBZ) as a broad spectrum fungicide is widely used in the whole world to contorl plant diseases. With the application of CBZ in the agriculture, it has been detected in vegetables and fruits. Nowadays, it even has been detected in the watercourse and indoor dust. However, the toxic effects of CBZ on aquatic organisms have received limited attention. In this study, male adult zebrafish were exposed at 0, 30 and 100 μg/L CBZ for 21 days to assess its effects on hepatic glycolipid metabolism. After exposure, the body weight and length decreased, but the condition factor increased significantly. Some hepatic biochemical parameters including the levels of glucose, pyruvate, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) decreased significantly in the liver of zebrafish after exposure with CBZ. Two transaminases alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) also increased significantly, indicating that subchronic CBZ exposure influenced the liver function. Moreover, the relative mRNA levels of some key genes related to the glycolysis and lipid metabolism in the liver also changed significantly. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis showed that the carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism and detoxification metabolism were also affected in the liver of CBZ exposed zebrafish. Interestingly, we also found the amounts of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at phylum level significantly decreased in the gut. Sequencing V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA also demonstrated gut microbiota composition changed significantly according to weighted UniFrac distance analysis. Consequently, subchronic CBZ exposure induced hepatic metabolic disorder accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis in adult male zebrafish.

TI  - Increased cell proliferation and neural activity by physostigmine in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish.
T2  - Neuroscience letters
AB  - Physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is known to affect the brain function in various aspects. This study was conducted to test whether physostigmine affects cell proliferation in the telencephalon of zebrafish. BrdU-labeled cells was prominently observed in the ventral zone of the ventral telencephalon of zebrafish. The increased number of BrdU- and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeled cells were shown in zebrafish treated with 200μM physostigmine, which was inhibited by pretreatment with 200μM scopolamine. iNOS mRNA expression was increased in the brain of zebrafish treated with 200μM physostigmine. Consistently, aminoguanidine, an iNOS inhibitor, attenuated the increase in the number of BrdU-labeled cells by physostigmine treatment. Zebrafish also showed seizure-like locomotor activity characterized by a rapid and abrupt movement during a 30min treatment with 200μM physostigmine. Neural activity in response to an electrical stimulus was increased in the isolated telencephalon of zebrafish continuously perfused with 200μM physostigmine. None of the number of BrdU-labeled cells, neural activity, or locomotor activity was affected by treatment with 20μM physostigmine. These results suggest that 200μM physostigmine increased neural activity and induced cell proliferation via nitric oxide production in zebrafish.

TI  - Synthetic resin acid derivatives selectively open the hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel and prevent epileptic seizures.
T2  - Epilepsia
AB  - Objective: About one third of all patients with epilepsy have pharmacoresistant seizures. Thus there is a need for better pharmacological treatments. The human voltage-gated potassium (hKV) channel hKV7.2/7.3 is a validated antiseizure target for compounds that activate this channel. In a previous study we have shown that resin acid derivatives can activate the hKV7.2/7.3 channel. In this study we investigated if these channel activators have the potential to be developed into a new type of antiseizure drug. Thus we examined their structure-activity relationships and the site of action on the hKV7.2/7.3 channel, if they have unwanted cardiac and cardiovascular effects, and their potential antiseizure effect. Methods: Ion channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines and explored with two-electrode voltage-clamp or automated patch-clamp techniques. Unwanted vascular side effects were investigated with isometric tension recordings. Antiseizure activity was studied in an electrophysiological zebrafish-larvae model. Results: Fourteen resin acid derivatives were tested on hKV7.2/7.3. The most efficient channel activators were halogenated and had a permanently negatively charged sulfonyl group. The compounds did not bind to the sites of other hKV7.2/7.3 channel activators, retigabine, or ICA-069673. Instead, they interacted with the most extracellular gating charge of the S4 voltage-sensing helix, and the effects are consistent with an electrostatic mechanism. The compounds altered the voltage dependence of hKV7.4, but in contrast to retigabine, there were no effects on the maximum conductance. Consistent with these data, the compounds had less smooth muscle–relaxing effect than retigabine. The compounds had almost no effect on the voltage dependence of hKV11.1, hNaV1.5, or hCaV1.2, or on the amplitude of hKV11.1. Finally, several resin acid derivatives had clear antiseizure effects in a zebrafish-larvae model. Significance: The described resin acid derivatives hold promise for new antiseizure medications, with reduced risk for adverse effects compared with retigabine. © 2021 The Authors.

T2  - Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)
AB  - The use of zebrafish for high throughput screening (HTS) for chemical bioactivity assessments is becoming routine in the fields of drug discovery and toxicology. Here we report current recommendations from our experiences in zebrafish HTS. We compared the effects of different high throughput chemical delivery methods on nominal water concentration, chemical sorption to multi-well polystyrene plates, transcription responses, and resulting whole animal responses. We demonstrate that digital dispensing consistently yields higher data quality and reproducibility compared to standard plastic tip-based liquid handling. Additionally, we illustrate the challenges in using this sensitive model for chemical assessment when test chemicals have trace impurities. Adaptation of these better practices for zebrafish HTS should increase reproducibility across laboratories.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase in zebrafish embryos as a tool to identify neurotoxic effects in sediments.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - In order to clarify the suitability of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos for the detection of neurotoxic compounds, the acetylcholinesterase assay was adapted and validated with a series of priority pollutants listed as relevant for the European water policy (Aroclor 1254, 2,3-benzofuran, bisphenol A, chlorpyrifos, paraoxon-methyl, quinoline, and methyl mercury chloride) as well as acetonic extracts from three sediments of known contamination. The acute toxicities of the model substances and the sediment extracts were determined by means of the fish embryo test as specified in OECD TG 236, and concentrations as low as the effective concentration at 10% inhibition (EC10) were used as the highest test concentration in the acetylcholinesterase test in order to avoid nonspecific systemic effects mimicking neurotoxicity. Among the model compounds, only the known acetylcholinesterase inhibitors paraoxon-methyl and chlorpyrifos produced a strong inhibition to about 20 and 33%, respectively, of the negative controls. For the sediment extracts, a reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity to about 60% could only be shown for the Vering Canal sediment extracts; this could be correlated to high contents of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as identified by chemical analyses. Co-incubation of the Vering Canal sediment extracts with chlorpyrifos at EC10 concentrations each did not significantly increase the inhibitory effect of chlorpyrifos, indicating that the mode of action of acetylcholinesterase inhibition by the sediment-borne PAHs is different to that of the typical acetylcholinesterase blocker chlorpyrifos. Overall, the study documents that zebrafish embryos represent a suitable model not only to reveal acetylcholinesterase inhibition, but also to investigate various modes of neurotoxic action.

TI  - Developmental Deltamethrin Exposure Causes Persistent Changes in Dopaminergic Gene Expression, Neurochemistry, and Locomotor Activity in Zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Pyrethroids are commonly used insecticides that are considered to pose little risk to human health. However, there is an increasing concern that children are more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. We used the zebrafish model to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to low doses of the pyrethroid deltamethrin results in persistent alterations in dopaminergic gene expression, neurochemistry, and locomotor activity. Zebrafish embryos were treated with deltamethrin (0.25-0.50 μg/l), at concentrations below the LOAEL, during the embryonic period [3-72 h postfertilization (hpf)], after which transferred to fresh water until the larval stage (2-weeks postfertilization). Deltamethrin exposure resulted in decreased transcript levels of the D1 dopamine (DA) receptor (drd1) and increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase at 72 hpf. The reduction in drd1 transcripts persisted to the larval stage and was associated with decreased D2 dopamine receptor transcripts. Larval fish, exposed developmentally to deltamethrin, had increased levels of homovanillic acid, a DA metabolite. Since the DA system is involved in locomotor activity, we measured the swim activity of larval fish following a transition to darkness. Developmental exposure to deltamethrin significantly increased larval swim activity which was attenuated by concomitant knockdown of the DA transporter. Acute exposure to methylphenidate, a DA transporter inhibitor, increased swim activity in control larva, while reducing swim activity in larva developmentally exposed to deltamethrin. Developmental exposure to deltamethrin causes locomotor deficits in larval zebrafish, which is likely mediated by dopaminergic dysfunction. This highlights the need to understand the persistent effects of low-dose neurotoxicant exposure during development.

TI  - Potential aquatic environmental risks of trifloxystrobin: Enhancement of virus susceptibility in zebrafish through initiation of autophagy.
T2  - Zoological research
AB  - Chronic pollution in aquatic ecosystems can lead to many adverse effects, including a greater susceptibility to pathogens among resident biota. Trifloxystrobin (TFS) is a strobilurin fungicide widely used in Asia to control soybean rust. However, it has the potential to enter aquatic ecosystems, where it may impair fish resistance to viral infections. To explore the potential environmental risks of TFS, we characterized the antiviral capacities of fish chronically exposed to TFS and subsequently infected with spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). Although TFS exhibited no significant cytotoxicity at the tested environmental concentrations during viral challenge, SVCV replication increased significantly in a time-dependent manner within epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and zebrafish exposed to 25 μg/L TFS. Results showed that the highest viral load was more than 100-fold that of the controls. Intracellular biochemical assays indicated that autophagy was induced by TFS, and associated changes included an increase in autophagosomes, conversion of LC3-II, accumulation of Beclin-1, and degradation of P62 in EPC cells and zebrafish. In addition, TFS markedly decreased the expression and phosphorylation of mTOR, indicating that activation of TFS may be associated with the mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of the immunosuppressive effects of TFS on non-target aquatic hosts and suggests that the existence of TFS in aquatic environments may contribute to outbreaks of viral diseases.

TI  - Regulation of TRAF6 by MicroRNA-146a in Zebrafish Embryos after Exposure to Di(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate at Different Concentrations.
T2  - Chemical research in toxicology
AB  - As an endocrine disruptor, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is ubiquitous in multiple environmental media, causing long-term toxic effects on organisms. MicroRNAs are a class of noncoding RNAs with only 20-24 nucleotides in length, which regulate the expression of many protein-coding genes when organisms are exposed to environmental chemicals. MiR-146a, a differentially expressed miRNA after DEHP exposure, was screened by miRNA sequencing. As its target, TRAF6 was predicted and identified by double fluorescent protein assay and double fluorescent gene reporting assay. It shows the contrary expression pattern with miR-146a when mimics and inhibitors were transfected into ZF4 cells. MiR-146a and TRAF6 were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in zebrafish embryos exposed to a low-dose concentration gradient of DEHP. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of DEHP toxicity and suggest that miR-146a can serve as a potential biomarker for DEHP exposure.

TI  - Gene knockdown by morpholino-modified oligonucleotides in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model: applications for developmental toxicology.
T2  - Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has long been used as a model for developmental biology, making it an excellent model to use also in developmental toxicology. The many advantages of zebrafish include their small size, prolific spawning, rapid development, and transparent embryos. They can be easily manipulated genetically through the use of transgenic technology and gene knockdown via morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides (MOs). Knocking down specific genes to assess their role in the response to toxicant exposure provides a way to further our knowledge of how developmental toxicants work on a molecular and mechanistic level while establishing a relationship between these molecular events and morphological, behavioral, and/or physiological effects (i.e., phenotypic anchoring). In this chapter, we address important considerations for using MOs to study developmental toxicology in zebrafish embryos and provide a protocol for their use.

TI  - Biomarker responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio) following long-term exposure to microplastic-associated chlorpyrifos and benzo(k)fluoranthene.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Continuously increasing plastic production causes a constant accumulation of microplastic particles (MPs) in the aquatic environment, especially in industrialized and urbanized areas with elevated wastewater discharges. This coincides with the release of persistent organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides) entering limnic ecosystems. Although the assessment of potential effects of environmental pollutants sorbed to MPs under chronic exposure scenarios seems vital, data on potential hazards and risk by combined exposure to pollutants and microplastics for aquatic vertebrates is still limited. Therefore, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed over 21 days to the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF; 10 and 100 ng/L) and the PAH benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF; 0.78 and 50 µg/L) either dissolved directly in water or sorbed to different MPs (irregular polystyrene, spherical polymethyl methacrylate; ≤ 100 µm), where CPF was sorbed to polystyrene MPs and BkF was sorbed to polymethyl methacrylate MPs. Contaminant sorption to MPs and leaching were documented using GC-EI-MS; potential accumulation was studied in cryosections of the gastrointestinal tract. Enzymatic biomarkers and biotransformation were measured in liver and brain. Overall, exposure to non-contaminated MPs did not induce any adverse effects. Results of fluorescence tracking, CYP1A modulation by BkF as well as changes in acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) by CPF were less pronounced when contaminants were sorbed to MPs, indicating reduced bioavailability of pollutants. Overall, following exposure to waterborne BkF, only minor amounts of parent BkF and biotransformation products were detected in zebrafish liver. Even high loads of MPs and sorbed contaminants did not induce adverse effects in zebrafish; thus, the potential threat of MPs as vectors for contaminant transfer in limnic ecosystems can be considered limited.

TI  - Expression and function of KCNQ channels in larval zebrafish.
T2  - Developmental neurobiology
AB  - Members of the K(v)7 family generate a subthreshold potassium current, termed M-current, that regulates the excitability of principal central neurons. Mutations in two members of this family, K(v)7.2 (KCNQ2) and K(v)7.3 (KCNQ3) are associated with a neurological disorder known as benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC). Despite their importance in normal and pathological brain function, developmental expression and function of these channels remains relatively unexplored. Here, we examined the temporal expression of K(v)7 channel subunits in zebrafish larvae using a real-time quantitative PCR approach. Spatial expression in the larval zebrafish brain was assessed using whole-mount in situ hybridization. The mRNA for three members of the K(v)7 family (KCNQ2, 3 and 5) is reported in zebrafish between two and seven days post-fertilization (dpf). Using electrophysiological techniques, we show that inhibitors of K(v)7 channels (linopirdine and XE991) induce burst discharge activity in immature zebrafish between 3 and 7 dpf. This abnormal electrical activity is blocked by a K(v)7 channel opener (retigabine) and was also shown to evoke convulsive behaviors in freely swimming zebrafish. Using morpholino oligonucleotides directed against KCNQ3, we confirmed a role for KCNQ channels in generation of electrical burst discharges. These results indicate that functional K(v)7 channels are expressed in the larval zebrafish nervous system and could play a direct role in generation of seizure activity.

TI  - Dinitroaniline herbicide pendimethalin affects development and induces biochemical and histological alterations in zebrafish early-life stages.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Pendimethalin (PND) is a dinitroaniline preemergent herbicide widely used to control grasses and weeds. The present study aimed to evaluate the PND potential effects on the development of zebrafish early-life stages. The research focuses first on acute toxicity, followed by the integration of toxicity results through histopathology, oxidative status, and neurotoxicity evaluation of sublethal and environmentally relevant concentrations. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PND showed mortality and developed sublethal alterations including impaired fin development, lordosis, scoliosis, blood congestion, impaired blood flow, and reduced heartbeat. PND exposure (0.5 mg/L) affects musculoskeletal development leading to delayed and reduced ossification of the vertebral centra in the developing vertebral column and disruption of muscle morphology. Herbicide exposure (0.5 mg/L and 0.05 mg/L) led also to biochemical changes of antioxidant enzymes, increasing the activity of CAT, GR, and GPx, while no effects were observed on the activity of SOD and GST in zebrafish larvae. Lastly, AChE activity, a biochemical marker of neurotoxicity, was also increased in zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.5 mg/L of PND. These results confirm the developmental toxicity of PND in zebrafish early-life stages, pointing out the potential role of oxidative stress in the onset of sublethal alterations.

TI  - 1H-NMR-based metabolomic study on toxicity of methomyl and methidathion in fish.
T2  - Journal of environmental science and health. Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes
AB  - A (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with multivariate analysis was applied to detect the toxicity of antiacetylcholinesterase insecticides, methomyl (methyl (1E)-N-(methylcarbamoyloxy)ethanimidothioate) and methidathion (3-(dimethoxyphosphinothioyl sulfanylmethyl)-5-methoxy-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-one), using zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Chinese bleak (Aphyocypris chinensis). Generally, methomyl and methidathion have been believed not to highly accumulate in fish tissues. However, these pesticides showed their toxicity by altering patterns of whole-body metabolites in neurotransmitter balance, energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and muscle maintenance in low concentrations. We used Pearson correlation analysis to contextualize the metabolic markers in pesticide treated groups. We observed that the positive correlations of choline with acetate and betaine in untreated control were shifted to null correlations showing acetylcholinesterase specific toxicity. This research demonstrated the applicability and potential of NMR metabolomics in detecting toxic effects of insecticide with a modicum of concentrations in aquatic environment.

TI  - Aryl organophosphate flame retardants induced cardiotoxicity during zebrafish embryogenesis: by disturbing expression of the transcriptional regulators.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - As a result of the ban on some brominated flame retardants (BFRs), the use of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) increases, and they are detected in multi-environment media at higher frequency and concentrations. However, the toxicity data of OPFRs, especially those on developmental toxicology are quite limited, which prevents an accurate evaluation of their environmental and health risk. Because a previous study reported that two aryl-OPFRs induced cardiotoxicity during zebrafish embryogenesis, we designed experiments to compare the heart developmental toxicity of a series of aryl-OPFRs with alkyl-OPFRs and explored possible internal mechanism. First, acute toxicity of 9 frequently used OPFRs were studied with zebrafish embryos (2-96 hpf). By comparing the LC50 and EC50 (pericardium edema) data, two aryl-OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) showed greater heart developmental toxicity than the others. It was also found that the acute toxicity of OPFRs varied mainly depending on their hydrophobicity. Further study on the cardiotoxicity of TPhP and CDP showed that the cardiac looping progress can be impeded by 0.10mg/L TPhP or CDP exposure. Bradycardia and reduction of myocardium were also observed in 0.50 and 1.0mg/L TPhP groups and 0.10, 0.50, and 1.0mg/L CDP groups. 0-48 hpf is the vulnerable window of zebrafish cardiogenesis that can be easily affected by TPhP and CDP. RT-qPCR measurement on the expressions of key transcriptional regulators in cardiogenesis showed that BMP4, NKX2-5, and TBX5 were significantly inhibited at the exposure points of 12 hpf and 24 hpf which may be the internal factors related to the heart developmental toxicity. As zebrafish is a good model organism for human health study, the present results call for a greater attention to the health risk of fetus in pregnant women exposed to such OPFRs.

TI  - Regulation of Ahr signaling by Nrf2 during development: Effects of Nrf2a deficiency on PCB126 embryotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - The embryotoxicity of co-planar PCBs is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), and has been reported to involve oxidative stress. Ahr participates in crosstalk with another transcription factor, Nfe2l2, or Nrf2. Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements to regulate the adaptive response to oxidative stress. To explore aspects of the crosstalk between Nrf2 and Ahr and its impact on development, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio) with a mutated DNA binding domain in Nrf2a (nrf2a(fh318/fh318)), rendering these embryos more sensitive to oxidative stress. Embryos were exposed to 2 nM or 5 nM PCB126 at 24 h post fertilization (prim-5 stage of pharyngula) and examined for gene expression and morphology at 4 days post fertilization (dpf; protruding - mouth stage). Nrf2a mutant eleutheroembryos were more sensitive to PCB126 toxicity at 4 dpf, and in the absence of treatment also displayed some subtle developmental differences from wildtype embryos, including delayed inflation of the swim bladder and smaller yolk sacs. We used qPCR to measure changes in expression of the nrf gene family, keap1a, keap1b, the ahr gene family, and known target genes. cyp1a induction by PCB126 was enhanced in the Nrf2a mutants (156-fold in wildtypes vs. 228-fold in mutants exposed to 5 nM). Decreased expression of heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (hmox1) in the Nrf2a mutants was accompanied by increased nrf2b expression. Target genes of Nrf2a and AhR2, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (nqo1) and glutathione S-transferase, alpha-like (gsta1), showed a 2-5-fold increase in expression in the Nrf2a mutants as compared to wildtype. This study elucidates the interaction between two important transcription factor pathways in the developmental toxicity of co-planar PCBs.

TI  - Acute exposure to 4-OH-A, not PCB(1254), alters brain aromatase activity but does not adversely affect growth in zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Acute developmental exposure to pharmaceuticals or environmental contaminants can have deleterious, long lasting effects. Many of these compounds are endocrine disruptors (EDCs) that target estrogen signaling, with effects on reproductive and non-reproductive tissues. We recently reported that zebrafish larvae transiently exposed to the pharmaceutical EDC 4-OH-A display visual deficits as adults. Here, we examine whether these long-term effects are due to compound-induced morphological and/or cellular changes. Zebrafish aged 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or 7 days post-fertilization (larvae) or 3-4mos (adults) were exposed to either 4-OH-A or PCB(1254) for 24 h. After that time, notochord length, eye diameter, inter-eye distance, and heart rate were measured from larvae; and aromatase (estrogen synthase) activity was measured in homogenates of adult brain tissue. In general, indices of larval growth and development were not altered by 24 h exposure to either compound. 4-OH-A potently inhibited aromatase activity, while PCB(1254) did not, with inhibition continuing even after removal from treatment. These results support differential function of EDCs and indicate that developmental exposure to 4-OH-A causes sustained inhibition of aromatase, which could be associated with altered adult behaviors.

TI  - PCB126 exposure disrupts zebrafish ventricular and branchial but not early neural crest development.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - We have used zebrafish and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) to investigate the developmental toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that exert their effects through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We found that cardiac and neural crest (NC)-derived jaw and branchial cartilages are specifically targeted early in development. The suite of malformations, which ultimately leads to circulatory failure, includes a severely dysmorphic heart with a reduced bulbus arteriosus and abnormal atrioventricular and outflow valve formation. Early NC migration and patterning of the jaw and branchial cartilages was normal. However, the jaw and branchial cartilages failed to grow to normal size. In the heart, the ventricular myocardium showed a reduction in cell number and size. The heart and jaw/branchial phenotype could be rescued by pifithrin-alpha, a blocker of p53. However, the function of pifithrin-alpha in this model may act as a competitive inhibitor of PCB at the AHR and is likely independent of p53. Morpholinos against p53 did not rescue the phenotype, nor were zebrafish with a mutant p53-null allele resistant to PCB126 toxicity. Morpholino knockdown of cardiac troponin T, which blocks the onset of cardiac function, prevented the PCB126-induced cardiac dysmorphogenesis but not the jaw/branchial phenotype. The cardiovascular characteristics appear to be similar to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and introduce the potential of zebrafish as a model to study this environmentally induced cardiovascular malformation. HLHS is a severe congenital cardiovascular malformation that has previously been linked to industrial releases of dioxins and PCBs.

TI  - CXCL20a, a Teleost-Specific Chemokine That Orchestrates Direct Bactericidal, Chemotactic, and Phagocytosis-Killing-Promoting Functions, Contributes to Clearance of Bacterial Infections.
T2  - Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)
AB  - The major role of chemokines is to act as a chemoattractant to guide the migration of immune cells to the infectious sites. In the current study, we found that CiCXCL20a, a teleost-specific chemokine from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), demonstrates broad-spectrum, potent, direct bactericidal activity and immunomodulatory functions to bacterial infections, apart from the chemotaxis. CiCXCL20a kills bacteria by binding, mainly targeting acid lipids, perforating bacterial membrane, resulting in bacterial cytoplasm leakage and death. CiCXCL20a aggregates and neutralizes LPS, agglutinates Gram-negative bacteria, and binds to peptidoglycan and Gram-positive bacteria, but not agglutinate them. All the complexes may be phagocytized and cleared away. CiCXCL20a chemoattracts leukocytes, facilitates phagocytosis of myeloid leukocytes, not lymphoid leukocytes, and enhances the bacteria-killing ability in leukocytes. We further identified its receptor CiCXCR3.1b1. Furthermore, we investigated the physiological roles of CiCXCL20a against Aeromonas hydrophila infection in vivo. The recombinant CiCXCL20a increases the survival rate and decreases the tissue bacterial loads, edema, and lesions. Then, we verified this function by purified CiCXCL20a Ab blockade, and the survival rate decreases, and the tissue bacterial burdens increase. In addition, zebrafish (Danio rerio) DrCXCL20, an ortholog of CiCXCL20a, was employed to verify the bactericidal function and mechanism. The results indicated that DrCXCL20 also possesses wide-spectrum, direct bactericidal activity through membrane rupture mechanism. The present study, to our knowledge, provides the first evidence that early vertebrate chemokine prevents from bacterial infections by direct bactericidal and phagocytosis-killing-promoting manners. The results also demonstrate the close functional relationship between chemokines and antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Fabrication of pH-responsive nanoparticles for high efficiency pyraclostrobin delivery and reducing environmental impact.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - In this work, a pH-responsive pesticide delivery system using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as the porous carriers and coordination complexes of Cu ions and tannic acid (TA-Cu) as the capping agent was established for controlling pyraclostrobin (PYR) release. The results showed the loading capacity of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles for pyraclostrobin was 15.7 ± 0.5% and the TA-Cu complexes deposited on the MSNs surface could protect pyraclostrobin against photodegradation effectively. The nanoparticles had excellent pH responsive release performance due to the decomposition of TA-Cu complexes under the acid condition, which showed 8.53 ± 0.37%, 82.38 ± 1.67% of the encapsulated pyraclostrobin were released at pH 7.4, pH 4.5 after 7 d respectively. The contact angle and adhesion work of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles on rice foliage were 86.3° ± 2.7° and 75.8 ± 3.1 mJ/m(2) after 360 s respectively, indicating that TA on the surface of the nanoparticles could improve deposition efficiency and adhesion ability on crop foliage. The control effect of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles against Rhizoctonia solani with 400 mg/L of pyraclostrobin was 85.82% after 7 d, while that of the same concentration of pyraclostrobin EC was 53.05%. The PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles did not show any phytotoxicity to the growth of rice plants. Meanwhile, the acute toxicity of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles to zebrafish was decreased more than 9-fold compared with that of pyraclostrobin EC. Thus, pH-responsive PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles have great potential for enhancing targeting and environmental safety of the active ingredient.

TI  - Muscarinic receptors mediate the endocrine-disrupting effects of an organophosphorus insecticide in zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - The glucocorticoid cortisol, the end product of hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio), is synthesized via steroidogenesis and promotes important physiological regulations in response to a stressor. The failure of this axis leads to inability to cope with environmental challenges preventing adaptive processes in order to restore homeostasis. Pesticides and agrichemicals are widely used, and may constitute an important class of environmental pollutants when reach aquatic ecosystems and nontarget species. These chemical compounds may disrupt hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis by altering synthesis, structure or function of its constituents. We present evidence that organophosphorus exposure disrupts stress response by altering the expression of key genes of the neural steroidogenesis, causing downregulation of star, hsp70, and pomc genes. This appears to be mediated via muscarinic receptors, since the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine blocked these effects.

TI  - Exposure to fenvalerate causes brain impairment during zebrafish development.
T2  - Toxicology letters
AB  - Compared with increasing evidence suggesting that fenvalerate is neurotoxic to adults, further information regarding developmental toxicity of this compound attracts more attention. In this study, we used zebrafish as an environmental monitoring model to further explore the potential toxicity of fenvalerate. Our results demonstrated that larvae exposed to fenvalerate for 24-96 h displayed obvious morphological abnormalities, and the LC50 concentrations were 131.95 microg/L (LC50-24h), 107.18 microg/L (LC50-48 h), 21.76 microg/L (LC50-72 h), and 6.25 microg/L (LC50-96 h). To further investigate the effects of fenvalerate on embryos and larvae, acridine orange staining was performed at a 50 microg/L concentration. Staining showed notable signs of apoptosis mainly in the brain. Further studies revealed that fenvalerate induced alterations in SOD activity in larvae were concentration dependent and also related to the length of exposure. Fenvalerate also down-regulated the expression of ogg1 and dlx2 genes in a concentration dependent manner, which indicated that the oxidative-DNA repair system as well as neurogenesis were impaired. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of fenvalerate using zebrafish, that provided new evidence of observable brain impairment during embryogenesis due to fenvalerate exposure and discussed their implications for the development of fenvalerate induced neurotoxicity.

TI  - Behavioral and physiological effects of RDX on adult zebrafish.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - 1,3,5-Trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) is a nitroamine explosive, with common toxic effects including seizures. Here, we explore the behavioral effects of acute RDX exposure in adult zebrafish Danio rerio, a rapidly developing model in neuroscience and neurotoxicology research. Overall, a 30-min exposure to RDX low dose of 0.1 mM evoked behavioral activation in zebrafish, while a higher dose of 1 mM markedly reduced exploration, increased freezing and evoked seizure-like responses (i.e., bouts of hyperactivity, spasms, and corkscrew swimming). Likewise, whole-body cortisol levels were also significantly elevated in fish exposed to 1 mM (but not 0.1 mM) RDX. In line with clinical and animal data, our study demonstrates the dose-dependent behavioral activation and pro-convulsant effects of RDX in zebrafish-based models.

TI  - The chlorine contents and chain lengths influence the neurobehavioral effects of commercial chlorinated paraffins on zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - Increasing concern has arisen regarding ubiquitous environmental distribution and potential ecological and health risks of chlorinated paraffins (CPs), especially short chain congeners. Four commercial CP products with different carbon chain lengths and chlorine contents were employed to investigate and compare the possible neurotoxic effects on zebrafish larvae at 5 days post fertilization using behavioral tests, including locomotion, path angle, and two-fish social interaction. The high-chlorinated short-chain CP-70 product resulted in the strongest effects in all three tests, while the low-chlorinated long-chain CP-42 product was on the other end of the spectrum. The consequences of the chain length of two CP-52 products could be clearly distinguished by the tests. Although exposure to the two products both caused inhibition in the locomotion test, they resulted in different kinds of effects in the path angle and interaction tests. Our results suggested, as evidenced by the sensitivity and resolution of the behavioral tests, that the influence of the chain length and chlorine content of CPs could be well characterized and that chlorine content consistently showed a more significant impact than chain length. The health threats of long-chain CPs could also not be overlooked when they contained relatively high chlorine contents.

TI  - The role of alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptors in the nicotine-induced anxiolytic effect in zebrafish.
T2  - Physiology & behavior
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been widely used to study the molecular mechanisms of development including neurodevelopment. More recently, they have begun to be used to study neuropharmacology and neurotoxicology. Critical for this line of research are methods to study behavioral function in zebrafish. Previous studies have compared zebrafish with mammalian models to determine similarities and differences in locomotor behavior, learning and memory. Relatively little research has been conducted on stress response and anxiety behavior as well as the pharmacologic response in zebrafish. We have developed a test for zebrafish to assess stress response and anxiety: the novel tank diving test. In this short test normally zebrafish dive to the bottom of a novel tank and then gradually over the 5-min test begin exploring higher levels of the tank. Nicotine, which has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans was found to diminish this novel tank diving response in zebrafish. The current study examined the nicotinic receptor subtype selectivity involved in the actions of nicotine. Two nicotinic receptor subtype selective antagonists were used: MLA (an alpha7 antagonist) and DHbetaE (an alpha4beta2 antagonist). We replicated our previous finding of the anxiolytic effect of nicotine with significantly less bottom dwelling by the fish after nicotine treatment. This nicotine-induced anxiolytic effect was reversed by both MLA and DHbetaE, indicating that both nicotinic alpha7 and alpha4beta2 receptors are involved in the nicotinic effect on anxiety in zebrafish.

TI  - Topographical analysis of reactive zinc in the central nervous system of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - Reactive zinc (Zn) is crucial for neuronal signaling and is largely distributed within presynaptic vesicles of some axon terminals of distinct vertebrates. However, the distribution of reactive Zn throughout the central nervous system (CNS) is not fully explored. We performed a topographical study of CNS structures containing reactive Zn in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Slices of CNS from zebrafish were stained by Neo-Timm and/or cresyl violet. The Zn specificity of Neo-Timm was evaluated with Zn chelants, N,N,N',N'-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), Zn sulfide washing solution, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Unfixed slices were also immersed in the fluorescent Zn probe (zinpyr-1). Yellow-to-brown-to-black granules were revealed by Neo-Timm in the zebrafish CNS. Telencephalon exhibited slightly stained regions, while rhombencephalic structures showed high levels of staining. Although stained granules were found on the cell bodies, rhombencephalic structures showed a neuropil staining profile. The TPEN produced a mild reduction in Neo-Timm staining, while HCl and mainly DEDTC abolished the staining, indicating a large Zn content. This result was also confirmed by the application of a Zn probe. The present topographical study revealed reactive Zn throughout the CNS in adult zebrafish that should be considered in future investigation of Zn in the brain on a larger scale.

TI  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate Reduces Growth Hormone Expression via Binding to Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone Receptors and Inhibits the Growth of Crucian Carp.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) has commonly been used as an additive flame retardant and frequently detected in the aquatic environment and in biological samples worldwide. Recently, it was found that exposure to TDCIPP inhibited the growth of zebrafish, but the relevant molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In this study, 5 day-old crucian carp (Carassius auratus) larvae were treated with 0.5, 5, or 50 μg/L TDCIPP for 90 days; the effect on growth was evaluated; and related molecular mechanisms were explored. Results demonstrated that 5 or 50 μg/L TDCIPP treatment significantly inhibited the growth of crucian carp and downregulated the expression of growth hormones (ghs), growth hormone receptor (ghr), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1). Molecular docking, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and in vitro experiments demonstrated that TDCIPP could bind to the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor protein of crucian carp and disturb the stimulation of growth hormone releasing hormone to the expression of ghs, resulting in the decrease of the mRNA level of gh1 and gh2 in pituitary cells. Our findings provide new perceptions into the molecular mechanisms of developmental toxicity of TDCIPP in fish.

TI  - Effects of Dechlorane Plus exposure on axonal growth, musculature and motor behavior in embryo-larval zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Developmental neurobehavioral toxicity of Dechlorane Plus (DP) was investigated using the embryo-larval stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Normal fertilized embryos were waterborne exposed to DP at 15, 30, 60 μg/L beginning from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf). Larval teratology, motor activity, motoneuron axonal growth and muscle morphology were assessed at different developmental stages. Results showed that DP exposure significantly altered embryonic spontaneous movement, reduced touch-induced movement and free-swimming speed and decreased swimming speed of larvae in response to dark stimulation. These changes occurred at DP doses that resulted no significant teratogenesis in zebrafish. Interestingly, in accord with these behavioral anomalies, DP exposure significantly inhibited axonal growth of primary motoneuron and induced apoptotic cell death and lesions in the muscle fibers of zebrafish. Furthermore, DP exposure at 30 μg/L and 60 μg/L significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, as well as the mRNA transcript levels of apoptosis-related genes bax and caspase-3. Together, our data indicate that DP induced neurobehavioral deficits may result from combined effects of altered neuronal connectivity and muscle injuries.

TI  - Effect of Pachybasin on General Toxicity and Developmental Toxicity in Vivo.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - To document the safety of pachybasin, a secondary metabolite of Trichoderma harzianum, for use as a bioagricultural agent, it was subjected to general toxicological testing in mice and developmental toxicity in zebrafish. With either 5 or 20 mg kg(-1) pachybasin i.p. injection, mice behavioral responses such as motor coordination, spontaneous locomotor activity, or nociceptive pain were not influenced. In long-term effect (daily injection for 14 days), the physiological, hematological, liver, and kidney functions were not altered either. Evidence for the developmental toxicity of pachybasin (10-100 μM) in 72-h exposure period was shown in zebrafish larvae, based on developmental retardation, impairment of chorion, and increase of mortality. In summary, there are no significant general toxicities presented in the pachybasin-treated adult male mice. However, the embryo-toxicity in aquatic biota should be taken into consideration during bioagricultural agent application.

TI  - FireMaster® 550 (FM 550) exposure during the perinatal period impacts partner preference behavior and nucleus accumbens core medium spiny neuron electrophysiology in adult male and female prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster.
T2  - Hormones and behavior
AB  - One of the most widely used flame retardant (FR) mixtures in household products is Firemaster 550 (FM 550). FM 550 leaches from items such as foam-based furniture and infant products, resulting in contamination of the household environment and biota. Previous studies indicate sex-specific behavioral deficits in rodents and zebrafish in response to developmental FM 550 exposure. These deficits include impacts on social and attachment behaviors in a prosocial rodent: the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). The prairie vole is a laboratory-acclimated rodent that exhibits spontaneous attachment behaviors including pair bonding. Here we extend previous work by addressing how developmental exposure to FM 550 impacts pair bonding strength via an extended-time partner preference test, as well as neuron electrophysiological properties in a region implicated in pair bond behavior, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core. Dams were exposed to vehicle or 1000 μg of FM 550 via subcutaneous injections throughout gestation, and female and male pups were directly exposed beginning the day after birth until weaning. Pair bond behavior of adult female and male offspring was assessed using a three hour-long partner preference test. Afterwards, acute brain slices of the NAcc core were produced and medium spiny neuron electrophysiological attributes recorded via whole cell patch-clamp. Behavioral impacts were sex-specific. Partner preference behavior was increased in exposed females but decreased in exposed males. Electrophysiological impacts were similar between sexes and specific to attributes related to input resistance. Input resistance was decreased in neurons recorded from both sexes exposed to FM 550 compared to vehicle. This study supports the hypothesis that developmental exposure to FM 550 impacts attachment behaviors and demonstrates a novel FM 550 effect on neural electrophysiology.

TI  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate Induces Genome-Wide Hypomethylation within Early Zebrafish Embryos.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) is a high-production volume organophosphate-based plasticizer and flame retardant widely used within the United States. Using zebrafish as a model, the objectives of this study were to determine whether (1) TDCIPP inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) within embryonic nuclear extracts; (2) uptake of TDCIPP from 0.75 h postfertilization (hpf, 2-cell) to 2 hpf (64-cell) or 6 hpf (shield stage) leads to impacts on the early embryonic DNA methylome; and (3) TDCIPP-induced impacts on cytosine methylation are localized to CpG islands within intergenic regions. Within this study, 5-azacytidine (5-azaC, a DNMT inhibitor) was used as a positive control. Although 5-azaC significantly inhibited zebrafish DNMT, TDCIPP did not affect DNMT activity in vitro at concentrations as high as 500 μM. However, rapid embryonic uptake of 5-azaC and TDCIPP from 0.75 to 2 hpf resulted in chemical- and chromosome-specific alterations in cytosine methylation at 2 hpf. Moreover, TDCIPP exposure predominantly resulted in hypomethylation of positions outside of CpG islands and within intragenic (exon) regions of the zebrafish genome. Overall, these findings provide the foundation for monitoring DNA methylation dynamics within zebrafish as well as identifying potential associations among TDCIPP exposure, adverse health outcomes, and DNA methylation status within human populations.

TI  - Toxicity of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine to larval zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, a cyclonitramine commonly known as RDX, is used in the production of military munitions. Contamination of soil, sediment, and ground and surface waters with RDX has been reported in different places around the world. Acute and subacute toxicities of RDX have been relatively well documented in terrestrial vertebrates, but among aquatic vertebrates the information available is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the acute toxicity of RDX to larval zebrafish. Mortality (LC50) and incidence of vertebral column deformities (EC50) were two of the end points measured in this study. The 96-h LC50 was estimated at 22.98 and 25.64 mgl(-1) in two different tests. The estimated no-observed-effective-concentration (NOEC) values of RDX on lethality were 13.27+/-0.05 and 15.32+/-0.30 mgl(-1); and the lowest-observed-effective-concentration (LOEC) values were 16.52+/-0.05 and 19.09+/-0.23 mgl(-1) in these two tests, respectively. The 96-h EC50 for vertebral deformities on survivors from one of the acute lethality tests was estimated at 20.84 mgl(-1), with NOEC and LOEC of 9.75+/-0.34 and 12.84+/-0.34 mgl(-1), respectively. Behavioral aberrations were also noted in this acute toxicity study, including the occurrence of whirling movement and lethargic behavior. The acute effects of RDX on survival, incidence of deformities, and behavior of larval zebrafish occurred at the high end of the most frequently reported concentrations of RDX in aquatic environments. The chronic effects of RDX in aquatic vertebrates need to be determined for an adequate assessment of the ecological risk of environmental RDX.

TI  - Toxic effects and mechanisms of common pesticides (Roundup and chlorpyrifos) and their mixtures in a zebrafish model (Danio rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Agrochemicals can adversely affect biodiversity, environment and human health, and commonly occur in mixtures with poorly characterized toxic mechanisms and health hazards. Here, we evaluated the individual and mixture toxicities of Roundup and chlorpyrifos in environmentally relevant concentrations to zebrafish using molecular and biochemical indices. Studied pesticides alone and in combination caused depletion of total antioxidant capacity and cellular thiols, overproduction of ROS, accumulation of oxidative lesions and elevated DNA damage in zebrafish liver. Notably, low concentration of Roundup induced a hormesis-like effect by stimulating the protective cellular mechanisms. Chlorpyrifos showed stronger prooxidant effects than Roundup and additionally caused nitrosative and carbonyl stress in zebrafish. At the organismal level, studied pesticides and their mixtures induced hepato- and neurotoxicity. The effects of the studied pesticides on biomarkers of apoptosis, endocrine disruption and immune disorders were generally weak and inconsistent. The multibiomarker assessment showed that chlorpyrifos is considerably more toxic than Roundup to zebrafish. The toxic effects of the pesticide mixtures were mostly driven by chlorpyrifos, with minimal or mitigating effects of Roundup addition. These findings elucidate the toxic mechanisms of common pesticides in a model vertebrate and demonstrate that health hazards of pesticide mixtures cannot be predicted from the effects of single pesticides.

TI  - Toxicologic evaluation of imazalil with particular reference to genotoxic and teratogenic potentials.
T2  - Toxicology and industrial health
AB  - Imazalil (IMA) is a fungicide that is used extensively in fruit plantations and post-harvest treatments. IMA is suspected to produce craniofacial malformations in vertebrates and scarce data are available about its genotoxicity. Therefore, toxicity tests on embryogenesis of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and genotoxicity biomonitoring assays on human lymphocytes were performed to assess the effects of IMA. For this aim, zebrafish embryos were continually exposed, from 0.5 to 144 h post-fertilization, to a range of concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 µM). IMA (0 to 672 µM) were also applied to the whole-blood cultures from two persons. We used chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronucleus (MN) tests to examine DNA damage by IMA in human peripheral lymphocytes. The fungicide significantly altered zebrafish development even at low concentrations and its effects were dose-dependent. Results of the experiment indicated that IMA concentrations of 10 µM and above negatively affected embryo survival and hatching success. Morphological analysis uncovered a large suite of abnormalities such as less melanin pigmentation, wavy notochord, crooked trunk, tail defect and cardiac edema. The cytogenetic results clearly showed that IMA caused increases of the frequencies of the structural chromosomal aberrations and the rates of MN as compared to controls in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, the present findings are of importance in the assessment of the potential risk of fungicides as IMA on aquatic ecosystems and humans.

TI  - Long-term dietary-exposure to non-coplanar PCBs induces behavioral disruptions in adult zebrafish and their offspring.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - The use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been banned for several decades. PCBs have a long biological half-life and high liposolubility which leads to their bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food chains over a wide range of trophic levels. Exposure can lead to changes in animal physiology and behavior and has been demonstrated in both experimental and field analyses. There are also potential risks to high trophic level predators, including humans. A maternal transfer has been demonstrated in fish as PCBs bind to lipids in eggs. In this study, behavioral traits (exploration and free swimming, with or without challenges) of contaminated zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults and their offspring (both as five-day-old larvae and as two-month-old fish reared under standard conditions) were measured using video-tracking. Long-term dietary exposure to a mixture of non-coplanar PCBs was used to mimic known environmental contamination levels and congener composition. Eight-week-old fish were exposed for eight months at 26-28 °C. Those exposed to an intermediate dose (equivalent to that found in the Loire Estuary, ∑(CB)=515 ng g⁻¹ dry weight in food) displayed behavioral disruption in exploration capacities. Fish exposed to the highest dose (equivalent to that found in the Seine Estuary, ∑(CB)=2302 ng g⁻¹ dry weight in food) displayed an increased swimming activity at the end of the night. In offspring, larval activity was increased and two-month-old fish occupied the bottom section of the tank less often. These findings call for more long-term experiments using the zebrafish model; the mechanisms underlying behavioral disruptions need to be understood due to their implications for both human health and their ecological relevance in terms of individual fitness and survival.

TI  - Swimming activity in zebrafish larvae exposed to veterinary antiparasitic pharmaceuticals.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Veterinary antiparasitic pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface waters and several of these pharmaceuticals act on the nervous system on the target organisms implying that neurological effects also might be of concern in non-target animals such as fish. We tested if exposure to antiparasitic pharmaceuticals affect swimming activity in 6 days old zebrafish larvae. The results revealed that most pharmaceuticals did not cause any effects in swimming activity. However, larvae exposed to 0.58 mg/L doramectin displayed reduced swimming activity even though they were classified as normal, having no morphological abnormalities.

TI  - Bioaccumulation, metabolism and endocrine-reproductive effects of metolachlor and its S-enantiomer in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the enantioselective bioaccumulation, metabolism, and toxic effects of metolachlor and S-metolachlor in zebrafish. Five-month-old zebrafish were exposed to metolachlor and S-metolachlor for 28 days, then transferred to clean water and purified for 7 days. In the uptake phase, S-metolachlor was preferentially accumulated at low concentrations, while metolachlor was preferentially accumulated at high concentrations. The two chemicals were metabolized by \textgreater70% in zebrafish on the first day and showed same metabolic process. At the accumulation endpoint, S-metolachlor had no significant inhibitory effect on the enzymes activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and developmental indicators of zebrafish. However, 300 μg/L metolachlor significantly inhibited the enzymes activities of SOD, CAT and GST and affected the liver development. The preferential enrichment of metolachlor at the high concentration may be the reason for its higher toxicity to zebrafish. Further research demonstrated that metolachlor significantly altered the expression of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis-related genes, including gnrh2, gnrh3, lhβ, 17βhsd and cyp19a, thereby reducing the levels of testosterone (T) in females and sex hormones (estradiol and testosterone) in males. S-metolachlor increased the levels of estradiol (E2) in females by altering the expression of HPG axis-related genes such as fshβ, cyp17, 17βhsd and cyp19a. The mechanism of metolachlor and S-metolachlor on the endocrine disrupting effects of zebrafish is different, which may be sex-specific. 7 days after transferring the exposed zebrafish to clean water, most of the enzymes activities, sex hormone levels and related gene expression levels returned to normal, which may be related to the rapid metabolism of the two chemicals.

T2  - Environment international
AB  - Early-life exposure to toxicants could affect health outcomes in adulthood. We determined the effects of early-life exposure to the organophosphorus flame-retardant tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) in adult zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to TDCIPP from early embryogenesis (2 h post-fertilization) to 10 days post-fertilization (dpf), and larvae were transferred to clean water until adulthood (150 dpf). TDCIPP showed accumulation in larvae, but returned to control levels after 7 days of depuration. In adult zebrafish exposed to TDCIPP in early life, vulnerability to anxiety-like behavior was observed in females but not males, suggesting gender-dependent neurotoxicity. Decreased dopamine (DA) concentration and down-regulation of dopaminergic signaling related genes were observed in the brains of adult females. Upregulation of DNA methylation transferases (dnmt1, dnmt3a, and dnmt3b) genes were observed in larvae and brains of adult females. Further, the promoter regions of the selected key genes (bdnf, drd4b, zc4h2 and th) showed increased DNA methylation status, accompanied by down-regulation of gene transcription in larvae and brains of adult females. Our results indicate that early-life exposure to TDCIPP could cause delayed neurotoxicity in adult zebrafish.

AB  - A fluorescence turn-on probe, 2-butyl-1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-6-yl 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate (NT-SH), has been constructed for sensing of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S). NT-SH exhibited excellent detection performance including favorable water solubility, low fluorescence background, high enhancement (45-fold), large linear response range (0-50 μM) and low detection limit (80.01 nM) for H(2)S in aqueous. In addition, the response mechanism of NT-SH for H(2)S was confirmed by the theoretical calculation and mass spectral analysis. More importantly, the imaging experiments of H(2)S in vitro and in vivo confirmed that NT-SH had low cytotoxicity, and favorable biocompatibility. In addition, it illustrated that NT-SH was able to detected exogenous H(2)S in living cells and zebrafish. These results suggested that NT-SH can be act as a potential molecular tool for detecting of H(2)S in aqueous solution, in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Ecotoxicological characterisation of a mycoherbicide mixture isolated from the fungus Ascochyta caulina.
T2  - Pest management science
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the possibility of using a mixture of three fungal toxins produced by Ascochyta caulina as a bioherbicide to control noxious weeds. However, to assess the commercial potential of this new bioherbicide, it is necessary to increase knowledge regarding the environmental behaviour of these toxins, and particularly their effects on non-target organisms. A negative ecotoxicological profile of this potential bioherbicide could eventually hinder its registration. RESULTS: In this study, acute and chronic effects of the A. caulina toxins (ACTs) on non-target organisms were evaluated in the laboratory. The (96 h) calculated algal Er C50 and NOEC were 142.7 and \textless12.5 mg L(-1) respectively. For daphnids, the EC50 (48 h, acute test) was 20.1 mg L(-1) , whereas the NOEC (21 day chronic reproduction test) was 6.3 µg L(-1) . No cases of mortality, sublethal effects or abnormalities were observed in the acute and chronic tests for Brachydanio rerio at a concentration of 100 mg L(-1) , indicating a low toxicity of ACTs for this organism. The calculated LC50 (14 days, acute test) and NOEC (56 day chronic reproduction) for earthworms were \textgreater1000 and ≥250 mg kg(-1) soil respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has provided baseline information needed to assess the potential hazard of the fungal toxins of A. caulina. In particular, the acute and chronic effects on aquatic (algae, Daphnia and fish) and terrestrial organisms (earthworms) have been highlighted. Finally, a comparison of the inherent toxicity of ACTs with other synthetic herbicides has shown comparative ecotoxicity of the tested mixture.

TI  - Early life exposure to PCB126 results in delayed mortality and growth impairment in the zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - The occurrence of chronic or delayed toxicity resulting from the exposure to sublethal chemical concentrations is an increasing concern in environmental risk assessment. The Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test with zebrafish provides a reliable prediction of acute toxicity in adult fish, but it cannot yet be applied to predict the occurrence of chronic or delayed toxicity. Identification of sublethal FET endpoints that can assist in predicting the occurrence of chronic or delayed toxicity would be advantageous. The present study characterized the occurrence of delayed toxicity in zebrafish larvae following early exposure to PCB126, previously described to cause delayed effects in the common sole. The first aim was to investigate the occurrence and temporal profiles of delayed toxicity during zebrafish larval development and compare them to those previously described for sole to evaluate the suitability of zebrafish as a model fish species for delayed toxicity assessment. The second aim was to examine the correlation between the sublethal endpoints assessed during embryonal and early larval development and the delayed effects observed during later larval development. After exposure to PCB126 (3-3000ng/L) until 5 days post fertilization (dpf), larvae were reared in clean water until 14 or 28 dpf. Mortality and sublethal morphological and behavioural endpoints were recorded daily, and growth was assessed at 28 dpf. Early life exposure to PCB126 caused delayed mortality (300 ng/L and 3000 ng/L) as well as growth impairment and delayed development (100 ng/L) during the clean water period. Effects on swim bladder inflation and cartilaginous tissues within 5 dpf were the most promising for predicting delayed mortality and sublethal effects, such as decreased standard length, delayed metamorphosis, reduced inflation of swim bladder and column malformations. The EC50 value for swim bladder inflation at 5 dpf (169 ng/L) was similar to the LC50 value at 8 dpf (188 and 202 ng/L in two experiments). Interestingly, the patterns of delayed mortality and delayed effects on growth and development were similar between sole and zebrafish. This indicates the comparability of critical developmental stages across divergent fish species such as a cold water marine flatfish and a tropical freshwater cyprinid. Additionally, sublethal effects in early embryo-larval stages were found promising for predicting delayed lethal and sublethal effects of PCB126. Therefore, the proposed method with zebrafish is expected to provide valuable information on delayed mortality and delayed sublethal effects of chemicals and environmental samples that may be extrapolated to other species.

TI  - Role of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on learning and memory in zebrafish.
T2  - Psychopharmacology
AB  - RATIONALE: Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a modulatory role in cognition, and zebrafish provide a preclinical model to study learning and memory. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of nicotine (NIC) and some new cytisine-derived partial agonists (CC4 and CC26) on spatial memory in zebrafish using a rapid assay on T-maze task. The role of α4/α6β2 and the α7 nAChRs in NIC-induced memory enhancement was evaluated using selective nAChR antagonists. RESULTS: Low and high doses of NIC, cytisine (CYT), CC4 and CC26 respectively improved and worsened the mean running time, showing an inverted U dose-response function. The effective dose (ED50) (×10⁻⁵ mg/kg) was 0.4 for CC4, 4.5 for CYT, 140 for NIC and 200 for CC26. NIC-induced cognitive enhancement was reduced by the selective nAChR subtype antagonists: methyllycaconitine (MLA) for α7, α-conotoxin (MII) for α6β2, dihydro-β-erythroidine (DhβE) for α4β2, the nonselective antagonist mecamylamine (MEC) and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (SCOP), with DhβE being more active than MLA or MII. All the partial agonists blocked the cognitive enhancement. The improvement with the maximal active dose of each partial agonist was blocked by low doses of DhβE (0.001 mg/kg) and MII (0.01 mg/kg). MLA reduced the effects of CC26 and CC4 at doses of 0.01 and 1 mg/kg, respectively, but did not antagonize CYT-induced memory improvement at any of the tested dose. No change in swimming activity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that zebrafish make a useful model for the rapid screening of the effect of new α4β2 nAChR compounds on spatial memory.

TI  - Toxicogenomic responses of zebrafish embryos/larvae to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) reveal possible molecular mechanisms of developmental toxicity.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) is frequently present in indoor dust and can be detected in human milk. In order to evaluate the effects of TDCPP on vertebrate development, zebrafish embryos/larvae were used as an animal model to examine developmental phenotypes and explore possible mechanisms of toxicity by employing microarrays and iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics. The results demonstrated that treatment with TDCPP (3 μM) from 0.75 h postfertilization (hpf) inhibited cell rearrangement at 4 hpf, caused delay in epiboly at 5.7 and 8.5 hpf, and led to abnormal development (e.g., short tail, reduced body size) and lethality between 14 and 45 hpf, which might be related with altered expression of genes regulating embryogenesis. Furthermore, trunk curvature was observed as the main phenotype in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae exposed to 1 or 3 μM TDCPP, possibly by changing somite formation and expression of proteins related to fast muscle and cartilage development. Collectively, our results suggest that exposure to TDCPP causes developmental toxicity in vertebrates and warrant the need for studies to evaluate the potential health risks of TDCPP to developing human embryos/infants/children, due to its frequent presence in indoor dust and potential for human exposure.

TI  - Pentachlorophenol exposure causes Warburg-like effects in zebrafish embryos at gastrulation stage.
T2  - Toxicology and applied pharmacology
AB  - Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a prevalent pollutant in the environment and has been demonstrated to be a serious toxicant to humans and animals. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism underlying its toxic effects on vertebrate early development. To explore the impacts and underlying mechanisms of PCP on early development, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to PCP at concentrations of 0, 20 and 50 μg/L, and microscopic observation and cDNA microarray analysis were subsequently conducted at gastrulation stage. The morphological observations revealed that PCP caused a developmental delay of zebrafish embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptomic data showed that 50 μg/L PCP treatment resulted in significant changes in gene expression level, and the genes involved in energy metabolism and cell behavior were identified based on gene functional enrichment analysis. The energy production of embryos was influenced by PCP via the activation of glycolysis along with the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The results suggested that PCP acts as an inhibitor of OXPHOS at 8 hpf (hours postfertilization). Consistent with the activated glycolysis, the cell cycle activity of PCP-treated embryos was higher than the controls. These characteristics are similar to the Warburg effect, which occurs in human tumors. The microinjection of exogenous ATP confirmed that an additional energy supply could rescue PCP-treated embryos from the developmental delay due to the energy deficit. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PCP causes a Warburg-like effect on zebrafish embryos during gastrulation, and the affected embryos had the phenotype of developmental delay.

TI  - Hematopoietic stem cell and immunotoxicity in zebrafish embryos induced by exposure to Metalaxyl-M.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Metalaxyl-M (MM), a protective and therapeutic fungicide, has been shown to be a promising candidate, but its toxicity toward aquatic organisms is unknown. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the immunotoxicity of MM in zebrafish embryos. Phenotypes (heart rate, body length, and yolk area) and the number of neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells in the thymus were analyzed in zebrafish embryo after exposure to MM. Our results showed that zebrafish embryos exposed to MM showed a concentration-dependent increase in the yolk area and a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils, macrophages, and thymus T cells. We detected upregulated expression of related immune signaling genes, such as tnfa, nfkb3, cxcl-c1c, il6, mmp9, and tgfb1. Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in HSCs in zebrafish larvae after exposure to MM. IWR-1 could restore the number of neutrophils and macrophages after exposure to MM. The results indicated that MM exerted developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity to zebrafish embryos, and these phenomena may be caused by MM's regulation of WNT signaling pathway.

TI  - Developmental and behavioral toxicity assessment of glyphosate and its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in zebrafish embryos/larvae.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - The relative toxicity of glyphosate (GLY) and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) to zebrafish were compared. Embryos/larvae were exposed to one dose of either GLY (0.1, 1, or 10 μM), AMPA (0.1, 1, or 10 μM), or a 1 μM mixture for 7-days post-fertilization. Survival, success of hatch, and deformity frequency were not different from controls. Neither chemical induced reactive oxygen species in larval fish. GLY increased superoxide dismutase 2 mRNA in larvae while AMPA increased catalase and superoxide dismutase 1 in a concentration-specific manner. GLY increased cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1 and citrate synthase mRNA in larvae while AMPA decreased cytochrome c oxidase I and increased 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase transcripts. Hyperactivity was noted in fish treated with GLY, but not AMPA nor the mixture. Anxiety-like behaviors were absent with exposure to GLY or AMPA. GLY and AMPA may exert different effects at the molecular and behavioral level.

TI  - Effects of embryonic exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on larval zebrafish behavior.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - Developmental disorders such as anxiety, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders have been linked to exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a ubiquitous anthropogenic pollutant. The zebrafish is widely recognized as an excellent model system for assessing the effects of toxicant exposure on behavior and neurodevelopment. In the present study, we examined the effect of sub-chronic embryonic exposure to the PCB mixture, Aroclor (A) 1254 on anxiety-related behaviors in zebrafish larvae at 7 days post-fertilization (dpf). We found that exposure to low concentrations of A1254, from 2 to 26 h post-fertilization (hpf) induced specific behavioral defects in two assays. In one assay with intermittent presentations of a moving visual stimulus, 5 ppm and 10 ppm PCB-exposed larvae displayed decreased avoidance behavior but no significant differences in thigmotaxis or freezing relative to controls. In the other assay with intermittent presentations of a moving visual stimulus and a stationary visual stimulus, 5 ppm and 10 ppm PCB-exposed larvae had elevated baseline levels of thigmotaxis but no significant differences in avoidance behavior relative to controls. The 5 ppm larvae also displayed higher terminal levels of freezing relative to controls. Collectively, our results show that exposure to ecologically valid PCB concentrations during embryonic development can induce functional deficits and alter behavioral responses to a visual threat.

TI  - Microglia Remodelling and Neuroinflammation Parallel Neuronal Hyperactivation Following Acute Organophosphate Poisoning.
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - Organophosphate (OP) compounds include highly toxic chemicals widely used both as pesticides and as warfare nerve agents. Existing countermeasures are lifesaving, but do not alleviate all long-term neurological sequelae, making OP poisoning a public health concern worldwide and the search for fully efficient antidotes an urgent need. OPs cause irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, inducing the so-called cholinergic syndrome characterized by peripheral manifestations and seizures associated with permanent psychomotor deficits. Besides immediate neurotoxicity, recent data have also identified neuroinflammation and microglia activation as two processes that likely play an important, albeit poorly understood, role in the physiopathology of OP intoxication and its long-term consequences. To gain insight into the response of microglia to OP poisoning, we used a previously described model of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) intoxication of zebrafish larvae. This model reproduces almost all the defects seen in poisoned humans and preclinical models, including AChE inhibition, neuronal epileptiform hyperexcitation, and increased neuronal death. Here, we investigated in vivo the consequences of acute DFP exposure on microglia morphology and behaviour, and on the expression of a set of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. We also used a genetic method of microglial ablation to evaluate the role in the OP-induced neuropathology. We first showed that DFP intoxication rapidly induced deep microglial phenotypic remodelling resembling that seen in M1-type activated macrophages and characterized by an amoeboid morphology, reduced branching, and increased mobility. DFP intoxication also caused massive expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines Il1β, Tnfα, Il8, and to a lesser extent, immuno-modulatory cytokine Il4, suggesting complex microglial reprogramming that included neuroinflammatory activities. Finally, microglia-depleted larvae were instrumental in showing that microglia were major actors in DFP-induced neuroinflammation and, more importantly, that OP-induced neuronal hyperactivation was markedly reduced in larvae fully devoid of microglia. DFP poisoning rapidly triggered massive microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, probably as a result of DFP-induced neuronal hyperexcitation, which in turn further exacerbated neuronal activation. Microglia are thus a relevant therapeutic target, and identifying substances reducing microglial activation could add efficacy to existing OP antidote cocktails.

TI  - Binary mixture of DDT and Arochlor1254: effects on sperm release by Danio rerio.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - A long-term toxicity test with zebrafish was carried out with different concentrations of DDT, Arochlor1254 (A54), and their 1:1 mixture under flow-through conditions. By collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously. Sperms are released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consist of bands of viscous material in which sperm are embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180 min after 24 h, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reductions in count, activity of sperm, and average life span of sperm trails were significant (P\textless0.05) at the tested concentrations, 5 and 50 microg/L after 1 month and 2 weeks of exposure to each chemical tested and to their mixture, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that DDT and A54 could react synergically and increase the alteration in sperm release and activity as well as the life span of their trails.

TI  - Scopolamine-induced learning impairment reversed by physostigmine in zebrafish.
T2  - Neuroscience research
AB  - In this study, the effects of scopolamine, an acetylcholine muscarinic receptor antagonist, and physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on the learning ability and memory of zebrafish were evaluated using a passive avoidance response test. The zebrafish were trained to stay in a dark compartment to avoid a weight dropping into an acryl shuttle chamber with a central sliding door. The crossing time was increased significantly, from 30.7+/-40.8s to 179.3+/-27.3s in the training session and 179.9+/-28.0s in the test session carried out 2h later in the controls. When treatment with 200 microM scopolamine was administered for 1h prior to the training session, the crossing time did not increase. The scopolamine-induced learning deficit was ameliorated by pretreatment with 20 microM physostigmine for 1h prior to scopolamine treatment; the crossing time was similarly increased, as shown with the controls (60.9+/-11.5s, 130.9+/-27.5s, and 183.4+/-26.6s in the training session and 108.1+/-23.9s in the test session). When scopolamine treatment was administered after the training session, the crossing time in the test session was reduced significantly as compared to that noted in the third trial of the training session, which was also ameliorated by physostigmine pretreatment. These results show that scopolamine impairs both the acquisition of passive avoidance response and retention of the learned response, and that physostigmine rescues the amnesic effects of scopolamine in zebrafish.

TI  - Pentachlorophenol has significant adverse effects on hematopoietic and immune system development in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - PloS one
AB  - In November 2018, the Camp Fire devastated the mountain community of Paradise, CA. The burning of plastic pipes, wiring, construction materials, paint, and car batteries released toxic chemicals into the environment, contaminating the air, soil, and local waterways. Examples of toxins that were identified in the creeks and waterways in and around Paradise included pentachlorophenol (PCP), chrysene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of some of these chemicals on embryonic development, hematopoiesis (blood formation), and the immune system have not been thoroughly studied. Defining safe levels and the long-term effects of exposure is imperative to understanding and mitigating potential negative future outcomes. To perform these studies, we utilized zebrafish (Danio rerio), a commonly used vertebrate model system to study development. We observed the adverse effects of PCP on the development of zebrafish by using fluorescence microscopy, and saw that increased concentrations of PCP decreased the numbers of normal red blood cells and myeloid cells. Additionally, we observed that animal survival decreased in response to increasing concentrations of PCP. Furthermore, the prevalence of characteristic physical deformities such as tail curvature were greater in the treatment groups. Lastly, runx1, cmyb, and cd41 expression was reduced in fish treated with PCP. These results suggest that PCP has a previously underappreciated effect on blood and immune cell development and future studies should be performed to determine the molecular mechanisms involved.

TI  - Imazalil and its metabolite imazalil-M caused developmental toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos via cell apoptosis mediated by metabolic disorders.
T2  - Pesticide biochemistry and physiology
AB  - Imazalil (IMZ) is a highly effective fungicide employed in crop production. It has been consistently detected in aquatic environments. The main environmental metabolite of IMZ is imazalil-M (IMZ-M). Limited studies have focused on the toxicity of IMZ and IMZ-M in aquatic organisms. This study systematically evaluated the developmental toxicity of IMZ and IMZ-M on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and explored the potential mechanisms involved. The results showed that IMZ and IMZ-M caused developmental toxicity, characterized by decreased heart rate, hatching inhibition, and pericardial cyst in zebrafish embryos. Subsequently, acridine orange (AO) staining revealed cell apoptosis in the area around the heart regions of zebrafish larvae. Besides, the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes also varied significantly. Furthermore, (1)H NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that IMZ and IMZ-M exposure could induce metabolic profiles disorder in zebrafish larvae. Importantly, zebrafish exposure to IMZ and IMZ-M significantly affected the metabolism of branched - chain amino acids, energy, and ketone bodies, which are related to cell apoptosis. Overall, the toxicity of IMZ and IMZ-M in zebrafish embryos and larvae was characterized, suggesting a theoretical basis for the potential environmental risks of IMZ and its metabolite IMZ-M on non-target organisms.

TI  - Dichloroacetate-induced developmental toxicity and production of reactive oxygen species in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology
AB  - Dichloroacetate (DCA) is one of the toxic by products that are formed during the chlorine disinfection process of drinking water. In this study, the developmental toxicity of DCA has been determined in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Embryos were exposed to different concentrations (4, 8, 16, and 32 mM) of the compound at the 4 h postfertilization (hpf) stage of development, and were observed for different developmental toxic effects at 8, 24, 32, 55, 80, and 144 hpf. Exposure of embryos to 8-32 mM of DCA resulted in significant increases in the heart rate and blood flow of the 55 and 80 hpf embryos that turned into significant decreases at the 144 hpf time point. At 144 hpf, malformations of mouth structure, notochord bending, yolk sac edema and behavioral effects including perturbed swimming and feeding behaviors were also observed. DCA was also found to produce time- and concentration-dependent increases in embryonic levels of superoxide anion (O2*-) and nitric oxide (NO), at various stages of development. The results of the study suggest that DCA-induced developmental toxic effects in zebrafish embryos are associated with production of reactive oxygen species in those embryos.

TI  - Locomotor activity in zebrafish embryos: a new method to assess developmental neurotoxicity.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - Currently, neurotoxicity testing defined by OECD and FDA is based solely on in vivo experiments, using large numbers of animals, being expensive, time-consuming and unsuitable for screening numerous chemicals. The great demand for thousands of chemicals yet to be evaluated, urges the development of alternative test methods which are cheaper, faster and highly predictive for developmental neurotoxicity. In this study, we developed a new method to assess locomotor activity in early life stage of zebrafish at 24 h post fertilization (hpf), in comparison to locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 96 to 192 hpf. We hypothesized that this endpoint at early life stages could be used to predict the developmental neurotoxic potential of chemicals and performed exposure studies with chlorpyrifos to demonstrate this. Furthermore, the case study with chlorpyrifos was used to critically evaluate behavioral data analysis and improve method sensitivity. The approach for data analysis using distribution plots for parameters on locomotor activity, next to mean values allowed to obtain more accurate information from the same set of behavioral data, both for embryos and larvae. Embryos exposed to chlorpyrifos, within the range 0.039 to 10 mg/l, exhibited a significant concentration-dependent increase in the frequency and total duration of their spontaneous tail coilings at 24-26 hpf. Larvae exhibited altered swimming activity, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the total duration of movement and an increase in mean turn angle in the range 0.18 to 0.75 mg/l chlorpyrifos. Methodological evaluation showed that locomotor effects in larvae were most pronounced and reproducible at 96 hpf, compared to older individuals (120, 144, 168 and 192 hpf). These new methods based on locomotor activity at early life stages of zebrafish allowed to classify chlorpyrifos as a developmental neurotoxicant. Further research to judge the validity of these alternative methods is currently performed with an extended set of expected positive or negative chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity.

TI  - A new RNase sheds light on the RNase/angiogenin subfamily from zebrafish.
T2  - The Biochemical journal
AB  - Recently, extracellular RNases of the RNase A superfamily, with the characteristic CKxxNTF sequence signature, have been identified in fish. This has led to the recognition that these RNases are present in the whole vertebrate subphylum. In fact, they comprise the only enzyme family unique to vertebrates. Four RNases from zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been previously reported and have a very low RNase activity; some of these are endowed, like human angiogenin, with powerful angiogenic and bactericidal activities. In the present paper, we report the three-dimensional structure, the thermodynamic behaviour and the biological properties of a novel zebrafish RNase, ZF-RNase-5. The investigation of its structural and functional properties, extended to all other subfamily members, provides an inclusive description of the whole zebrafish RNase subfamily.

TI  - Induction of developmental toxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos by Emamectin benzoate through oxidative stress.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Emamectin benzoate (EMB) is a widely used pesticide in agriculture, but its potential risks to the environment and health have not been fully evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the toxicity of Emamectin benzoate using zebrafish model, and found that it affected early embryonic development, such as malformations and delayed hatching. Mechanistically, Emamectin benzoate increased oxidative stress by excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal activities of the antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, Emamectin benzoate exposure caused abnormalities in zebrafish heart morphology and function, such as long SV-BA distance and slow heart rate. Alterations were induced in the transcription of heart development-related genes (nkx2.5, tbx5, gata4 and myl7). In summary, our data showed that Emamectin benzoate induces developmental toxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish. Our research provides new evidence on the Emamectin benzoate's toxicity and potential risk in human health.

TI  - Near-infrared ratiometric probe with a self-immolative spacer for rapid and sensitive detection of alkaline phosphatase activity and imaging in vivo.
T2  - Analytica chimica acta
AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate groups, is closely associated with many diseases, including bone disease, prostate cancer, and diabetes. Thus, new assays for ALP detection in live cells are needed to better understand its role in related biological processes. In this study, we constructed a novel near-infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe for detecting ALP activity with high sensitivity. The probe uses a new self-immolative mechanism that can achieve a rapid response (within 10 min) to ALP, detected as a spectral shift (from 580 to 650 nm). This method effectively avoids issues related to instrument variability, and the near-infrared fluorescence emission (650 nm) makes it more suitable for biological detection. Moreover, the high sensitivity (14-fold enhancement of the fluorescence ratio F(650)/F(580)) and low detection limit (0.89 U L(-1)) for ALP allows the probe to be adapted to complex biological environments. The assay was successfully performed using serum samples with a linear range of ALP of up to 150 U L(-1). We used the developed probe to detect and image endogenous ALP in cells with satisfactory results, and we successfully used the probes to detect changes in endogenous ALP levels in zebrafish caused by drug-induced organ damage.

Zebrafish embryos at ± 2 h post-fertilization were exposed to tebuconazole wettable powder concentrations (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg L(-1)) for 96 h with developmental toxicity assessed throughout the exposure period and biochemical parameters evaluated at the end of the exposure. Behavioural assessment (spatial exploration and response to stimuli) was conducted 24 h after the end of the exposure. While no developmental and physiological alterations were observed, exposure to tebuconazole resulted in an increased generation of reactive oxidative species at the 0.05 and 0.5 mg L(-1) concentrations and a decreased GPx activity at the 0.5 mg L(-1) concentration suggesting a potential protection mechanism. There was also a change in the avoidance-escape behaviour supporting an anxiolytic effect suggesting possible alterations in the central nervous system development demanding further studies.

TI  - Assessing the ecotoxicity of potentially neurotoxic substances - Evaluation of a behavioural parameter in the embryogenesis of Danio rerio.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The pollution of the aquatic environment is currently characterised by a large number of contaminants, especially by mixtures of micro-pollutants including neurotoxins. The ecotoxicological consequences of this burden are not yet assessable. Within the present study, a new test method was applied which evaluates behavioural changes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to quantify the neurotoxic effect of selected chemicals. Changes in the frequency of spontaneous tail movements - a parameter of locomotion - occurring during embryogenesis was assessed as parameter for neurotoxic effects. Embryos were exposed in 24-microwell plates to neurotoxic compounds. Behaviour was examined after 24 h of exposure by videotaping and quantifying spontaneous locomotion. Additionally, acute toxicity was determined after 48 h of exposure by utilising the fish embryo toxicity test. Abamectin, emamectin benzoate, chlorpyrifos-oxon and carbamazepine were analysed using both: the new and classic acute test methods. The results showed the neurotoxic effect of the substances. Furthermore, an increased sensitivity compared to acute toxicity data was shown. The aim of the present study, to illustrate the sensitivity and specificity of the established endpoint to reliably assess adverse, neurotoxic effects of compounds on the model organism Danio rerio and to apply a new test method was achieved. Therefore, the present study is a substantial contribution to an effect-based risk assessment of contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of selected xenoestrogens on liver peroxisomes, vitellogenin levels and spermatogenic cell proliferation in male zebrafish.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Environmental estrogenic compounds or xenoestrogens can mimic natural estrogens and cause a variety of adverse effects on aquatic wildlife. The purpose of the present work was to investigate if xenoestrogens are able to cause proliferation of liver peroxisomes using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. Adult male zebrafish were exposed for 15 days to 17beta-estradiol (E2) and the xenoestrogens dibutylphthalate (DBP), methoxychlor (MXC), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2). All five tested compounds caused significant proliferation of liver peroxisomes (p \textless 0.05) as indicated by increased peroxisomal surface and numerical densities and elevated activities of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX). In the case of DBP, MXC and E2, positive significant correlations between peroxisomal density parameters and AOX were found. The treatments did not produce gross alterations in testis histology, but spermatogenic cell proliferation was disturbed in E2 and EE2-treated groups and vitellogenin levels increased significantly in fish exposed to MXC, OP, EE2 and E2 with respect to controls. Furthermore, a significant correlation between vitellogenin levels and AOX activity was found for MXC, OP and EE2 treatments, suggesting that for the latter xenoestrogens early estrogenic effects are associated with liver peroxisome proliferation. No such association occurred with typical peroxisome proliferators such as DBP.

TI  - Simple, rapid zebrafish larva bioassay for assessing the potential of chemical pollutants and drugs to disrupt thyroid gland function.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Thyroid function may be altered by a very large number of chemicals routinely found in the environment Research evaluating potential thyroid disruption is ongoing, but there are thousands of synthetic and naturally occurring drugs and chemicals to be considered. European and United States policies call for the development of simple methodologies for screening endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Zebrafish are widely used as a model organism for assessing drug effects because of their small size, high fecundity, rapid organogenesis, morphological and physiological similarities to mammals, and easewithwhich large-scale phenotypic screening is performed. A zebrafish-based short-duration screening method was developed to detect the potential effect of chemicals and drugs on thyroid function. This method used a T4 immunofluorescence quantitative disruption test (TIQDT) to measure thyroid function. The 3 day exposure window protocol, from day 2 to day 5 postfertilization (dpf), avoided any potential side effects on thyroid gland morphogenesis. Methimazole, propylthiouracil, and potassium perchlorate, three well-known goitrogens, totally abolished T4 immunoreactivity in thyroid follicles in a dose-specific manner. Amiodarone, a human pharmaceutical with a reported cytotoxic effect on thyroid follicular cells, also decreased T4 levels. Moreover, exposure to 50 nM 3,3',5-triiodothyronine induced a significant decrease in T4 immunoreactivity as did DDT, 2,4-D, and 4-nonylphenol. In conclusion, these data indicated that TIQDT may be useful for obtaining initial information about the ability of environmental pollutants and drugs to impair thyroid gland function as well as assessing the combined effects of endocrine disruptors.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - A 4-day embryo-larval zebrafish test, from blastula stage to hatching included, was developed. The observations of embryo developmental were made at different development stages, for which morphological, physiological, and behavioral endpoints were selected and quantified for unexposed and exposed embryos. The sensitivity and the ability of these endpoints to inform about mode of action (MoA) were established in testing three model toxicants with well-known toxic effects (propranolol, malathion, cadmium). Lethal, sublethal (heart rate/edema, spontaneous movements, and hatching rate/time disturbance), and teratogenic effects were detected for all the studied compounds. This bioassay allows characterization of impairments at different biological levels: neuromuscular, physiological, morphological, and behavioral, and brings useful information about the toxic MoA of the chemicals on nontarget organisms. In this sense to answers the chemical industries and international organization (EMEA) requirements for the environmental risk assessment of new chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

TI  - Assessing sub-lethal effects of the dinitroaniline herbicide pendimethalin in zebrafish embryos/larvae (Danio rerio).
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - Pendimethalin is a dinitroaniline herbicide used to control broadleaf weeds by inhibiting the formation of microtubules during cell division. Its use on a variety of crops leads to its potential entry into aquatic environments, but little is known about its sub-lethal toxicity to early developmental stages of aquatic vertebrates. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the toxicity of pendimethalin to zebrafish embryos and larvae by measuring mortality, developmental abnormalities, oxidative respiration, reactive oxygen species, gene expression, and locomotor activity following exposure to the herbicide throughout early development. Embryos at \textasciitilde6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either a solvent control (0.1% DMSO, v/v), embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one dose of either 1, 2.5, 5, or 25 μM pendimethalin for up to 7-days post fertilization depending on the bioassay. Exposure to 25 μM pendimethalin resulted in high prevalence of spinal curvature, tail malformations, pericardial edema, and yolk sac edema at 4 dpf, while exposure to 5 μM pendimethalin induced pericardial edema and lordosis in the fish exposed over 7 dpf. Exposure to pendimethalin up to 5 μM did not negatively impact oxidative respiration (e.g., basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production) in embryos following a 24-h exposure. Pendimethalin did not induce reactive oxygen species at concentrations of 1-5 μM. Levels of transcripts associated with oxidative respiration and damage response were altered in 7d-larvae; cox1 mRNA was increased in larvae fish exposed to 1 μM while cox5a1 and sod2 mRNA were decreased with 2.5 μM exposure. The Visual Motor Response (VMR) test for light-dark response revealed that larval activity in the dark period was reduced for zebrafish exposed to \textgreater1 μM pendimethalin compared to ERM and DMSO solvent control groups. These data inform on the sub-lethal toxicity of pendimethalin to early stages of fish embryos and larvae.

TI  - Delayed effects of developmental exposure to low levels of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) on adult zebrafish behavior.
T2  - Neurotoxicology
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The most toxic PCBs are the non-ortho-substituted ("dioxin-like") congeners that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6, 1.2nM) for 20h (4-24h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126 resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation. Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior, suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the zebrafish model in detecting subtle and delayed behavioral effects resulting from developmental exposure to an environmental contaminant.

TI  - A Comparative Multi-System Approach to Characterizing Bioactivity of Commonly Occurring Chemicals.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
AB  - A 2019 retrospective study analyzed wristband personal samplers from fourteen different communities across three different continents for over 1530 organic chemicals. Investigators identified fourteen chemicals (G14) detected in over 50% of personal samplers. The G14 represent a group of chemicals that individuals are commonly exposed to, and are mainly associated with consumer products including plasticizers, fragrances, flame retardants, and pesticides. The high frequency of exposure to these chemicals raises questions of their potential adverse human health effects. Additionally, the possibility of exposure to mixtures of these chemicals is likely due to their co-occurrence; thus, the potential for mixtures to induce differential bioactivity warrants further investigation. This study describes a novel approach to broadly evaluate the hazards of personal chemical exposures by coupling data from personal sampling devices with high-throughput bioactivity screenings using in vitro and non-mammalian in vivo models. To account for species and sensitivity differences, screening was conducted using primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and early life-stage zebrafish. Mixtures of the G14 and most potent G14 chemicals were created to assess potential mixture effects. Chemical bioactivity was dependent on the model system, with five and eleven chemicals deemed bioactive in NHBE and zebrafish, respectively, supporting the use of a multi-system approach for bioactivity testing and highlighting sensitivity differences between the models. In both NHBE and zebrafish, mixture effects were observed when screening mixtures of the most potent chemicals. Observations of BMC-based mixtures in NHBE (NHBE BMC Mix) and zebrafish (ZF BMC Mix) suggested antagonistic effects. In this study, consumer product-related chemicals were prioritized for bioactivity screening using personal exposure data. High-throughput high-content screening was utilized to assess the chemical bioactivity and mixture effects of the most potent chemicals.

TI  - Zebrafish Oatp1d1 Acts as a Cellular Efflux Transporter of the Anionic Herbicide Bromoxynil.
T2  - Chemical research in toxicology
AB  - Toxicokinetics (TK) of ionic compounds in the toxico-/pharmacological model zebrafish embryo (Danio rerio) depend on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) processes. Previous research indicated involvement of transport proteins in the TK of the anionic pesticide bromoxynil in zebrafish embryos. We here explored the interaction of bromoxynil with the organic anion-transporting polypeptide zebrafish Oatp1d1. Mass spectrometry imaging revealed accumulation of bromoxynil in the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish embryos, a tissue known to express Oatp1d1. In contrast to the Oatp1d1 reference substrate bromosulfophthalein (BSP), which is actively taken up by transfected HEK293 cells overexpressing zebrafish Oatp1d1, those cells accumulated less bromoxynil than empty vector-transfected control cells. This indicates cellular efflux of bromoxynil by Oatp1d1. This was also seen for diclofenac but not for carbamazepine, examined for comparison. Correspondingly, internal concentrations of bromoxynil and diclofenac in the zebrafish embryo were increased when coexposed with BSP, inhibiting the activities of various transporter proteins, including Oatp1d1. The effect of BSP on accumulation of bromoxynil and diclofenac was enhanced in further advanced embryo stages, indicating increased efflux activity in those stages. An action of Oatp1d1 as an efflux transporter of ionic environmental compounds in zebrafish embryos should be considered in future TK assessments.

TI  - Tralopyril affects locomotor activity of zebrafish (Danio rerio) by impairing tail muscle tissue, the nervous system, and energy metabolism.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Tralopyril (TP), an antifouling biocide, is widely used to prevent heavy biofouling, and can have potential risks to aquatic organisms. In this study, the effect of TP on locomotor activity and related mechanisms were evaluated in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. TP significantly reduced locomotor activity after 168 -h exposure. Adverse modifications in tail muscle tissue, the nervous system, and energy metabolism were also observed in larvae. TP caused thinning of the muscle bundle in the tail of larvae. In conjunction with the metabolomics results, changes in dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment, indicate that TP may disrupt the nervous system in zebrafish larvae. The change in metabolites (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate, cis-Aconitic acid, acetoacetyl-CoA, coenzyme-A and 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA) involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism indicates that TP may disrupt energy metabolism. TP exposure may inhibit the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae by impairing tail muscle tissue, the nervous system, and energy metabolism.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of cartap on zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Cartap is a widely used insecticide which belongs to a member of nereistoxin derivatives and acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor site. Its effects on aquatic species are of grave concern. To explore the potential developmental toxicity of cartap, zebrafish embryos were continually exposed, from 0.5 to 144h post-fertilization, to a range of concentrations of 25-1000microg/l. Results of the experiment indicated that cartap concentrations of 100microg/l and above negatively affected embryo survival and hatching success. Morphological analysis uncovered a large suite of abnormalities such as less melanin pigmentation, wavy notochord, crooked trunk, fuzzy somites, neurogenesis defects and vasculature defects. The most sensitive organ was proved to be the notochord which displayed defects at concentrations as low as 25microg/l. Both sensitivity towards exposure and localization of the defect were stage specific. To elucidate mechanisms concerning notochord, pigmentation, and hatching defects, enzyme assay, RT Q-PCR, and different exposure strategies were performed. For embryos with hatching failure, chorion was verified not to be digested, while removing cartap from exposure at early pre-hatching stage could significantly increase the hatching success. However, cartap was proved, via vitro assay, to have no effect on proteolytic activity of hatching enzyme. These findings implied that the secretion of hatching enzyme might be blocked. We also revealed that cartap inhibited the activity of melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase and matrix enzyme lysyl oxidase and induced expression of their genes. These suggested that cartap could impaired melanin pigmentation of zebrafish embryos through inhibiting tyrosinase activity, while inhibition of lysyl oxidase activity was responsible for notochord undulation, which subsequently caused somite defect, and at least partially responsible for defects in vasculature and neurogenesis.

TI  - Exposure to difenoconazole induces reproductive toxicity in zebrafish by interfering with gamete maturation and reproductive behavior.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Difenoconazole (DCZ) is a triazole fungicide that negatively affects aquatic organisms and humans. However, data regarding the reproductive toxicity of DCZ are insufficient. In this study, we used zebrafish (from 2 h post-fertilization [hpf] to adulthood) as a model to evaluate whether DCZ at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μg/L) induces reproductive toxicity. After exposure to DCZ, egg production and fertilization rates were reduced by 1.0 and 10.0 μg/L. A significant decrease in gamete frequency (late vitellogenic oocytes and spermatozoa) was observed at 10.0 μg/L. The concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and vitellogenin (VTG) were disrupted in females and males by 1.0 and 10.0 μg/L. Exposure to 10.0 μg/L DCZ significantly inhibited the contact time between female and male fish, which was mainly achieved by affecting male fish. The transcription of genes involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis was significantly changed after treatment with DCZ. Overall, these data show that the endocrine-disrupting effect of DCZ on the zebrafish HPG axis inhibited gamete maturation and disrupted reproductive behavior, reducing fertility.

TI  - Zebrafish embryo neonicotinoid developmental neurotoxicity in the FET test and behavioral assays.
T2  - ALTEX
AB  - The need for reliable, sensitive (developmental) neurotoxicity testing of chemicals has steadily increased. Given the limited capacities for routine testing according to accepted regulatory guidelines, there is potential risk to human health and the environment. Most toxicity studies are based on mammalian test systems, which have been questioned for low sensitivity, limited relevance for humans, and animal welfare considerations. This increased the need for alternative models, one of which is the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo. This study assessed selected neonicotinoids at sub-lethal concentrations for their effects on embryonic development and behavior. The fish embryo acute toxicity test (OECD TG 236) determined the lowest observable effective concentrations, which were used as the highest test concentrations in subsequent behavioral assays. In the FET test, no severe compound-induced sublethal effects were seen at \textless 100 µM. In the coiling assay, exposure to ≥ 1.25 µM nicotine (positive control) affected both the burst duration and burst count per minute, whereas ≥ 50 µM thiacloprid affected the mean burst duration. Exposure to ≥ 50 µM acetamiprid and imidacloprid induced significant alterations in both mean burst duration and burst count per minute. In the swimming assay, 100 µM acetamiprid induced alterations in the frequency and extent of movements, whilst nicotine exposure only induced non-significant changes. All behavioral changes could be correlated to findings in mammalian studies. Given the quest for alternative test methods of (developmental) neurotoxicity, zebrafish embryo behavior testing could be integrated into a future tiered testing scheme.

TI  - Using metabolomic profiling to inform use of surrogate species in ecological risk assessment practices.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part D, Genomics & proteomics
AB  - The U.S. EPA frequently uses avian or fish toxicity data to set protective standards for amphibians in ecological risk assessments. However, this approach does not always adequately represent aquatic-dwelling and terrestrial-phase amphibian exposure data. For instance, it is accepted that early life stage tests for fish are typically sensitive enough to protect larval amphibians, however, metamorphosis from tadpole to a terrestrial-phase adult relies on endocrine cues that are less prevalent in fish but essential for amphibian life stage transitions. These differences suggest that more robust approaches are needed to adequately elucidate the impacts of pesticide exposure in amphibians across critical life stages. Therefore, in the current study, methodology is presented that can be applied to link the perturbations in the metabolomic response of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a surrogate species frequently used in ecotoxicological studies, to those of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles following exposure to three high-use pesticides, bifenthrin, chlorothalonil, or trifluralin. Generally, D. rerio exhibited greater metabolic perturbations in both number and magnitude across the pesticide exposures as opposed to X. laevis. This suggests that screening ecological risk assessment surrogate toxicity data would sufficiently protect amphibians at the single life stage studied but care needs to be taken to understand the suite of metabolic requirements of each developing species. Ultimately, methodology presented, and data gathered herein will help inform the applicability of metabolomic profiling in establishing the risk pesticide exposure poses to amphibians and potentially other non-target species.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Acute and long-term toxicity of 3,4-dichloroaniline and lindane to zebrafish were examined in tap water and water from the Rhine River and the toxicity of the binary mixture 3,4-dichloroaniline/lindane in tap water was investigated. The acute toxicity of 3,4-dichloroaniline and lindane was not influenced by the complex matrix of river water compared with tap water. The binary mixture of 3,4-dichloroaniline and lindane demonstrated an additive effect in the acute test. The survival rate of early life stages in river water was reduced by lindane (80 micrograms/liter), whereas the effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline on survival and growth were visible but not significant. The binary mixture of 2 micrograms/liter, 3,4-dichloroaniline and 40 micrograms/liter lindane in tap water had an influence on growth on the early life stages of zebrafish.

TI  - Brain zinc chelation by diethyldithiocarbamate increased the behavioral and mitochondrial damages in zebrafish subjected to hypoxia.
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - The increase in brain levels of chelatable zinc (Zn) in dysfunctions involving oxygen deprivation has stimulated the treatment with Zn chelators, such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC). However, DEDTC is a redox-active compound and it should be better evaluated during hypoxia. We use the hypoxia model in zebrafish to evaluate DEDTC effects. The exploratory behavior, chelatable Zn content, activities of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, reactive species levels (nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical scavenger capacity) and cellular antioxidants (sulfhydryl, superoxide dismutase) of zebrafish brain were assessed after recovery, with or without 0.2 mM DEDTC. The increased brain levels of chelatable Zn induced by hypoxia were mitigated by DEDTC. However, the novel tank task indicated that DEDTC did further enhance the exploratory deficit caused by hypoxia. Furthermore, these behavioral impairments caused by DEDTC were more associated with a negative action on mitochondrial activity and brain oxidative balance. Thus, due to apparent pro-oxidant action of DEDTC, our data do not support its use for neuroprotection in neuropathologies involving oxygen deprivation.

TI  - Discovery of a novel neuroprotectant, BHDPC, that protects against MPP+/MPTP-induced neuronal death in multiple experimental models.
T2  - Free radical biology & medicine
AB  - Progressive degeneration and death of neurons are main causes of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Although some current medicines may temporarily improve their symptoms, no treatments can slow or halt the progression of neuronal death. In this study, a pyrimidine derivative, benzyl 7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate (BHDPC), was found to attenuate dramatically the MPTP-induced death of dopaminergic neurons and improve behavior movement deficiency in zebrafish, supporting its potential neuroprotective activity in vivo. Further study in rat organotypic cerebellar cultures indicated that BHDPC was able to suppress MPP(+)-induced cell death of brain tissue slices ex vivo. The protective effect of BHDPC against MPP(+) toxicity was also effective in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells through restoring abnormal changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and numerous apoptotic regulators. Western blotting analysis indicated that BHDPC was able to activate PKA/CREB survival signaling and further up-regulate Bcl2 expression. However, BHDPC failed to suppress MPP(+)-induced cytotoxicity and the increase of caspase 3 activity in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89. Taken together, these results suggest that BHDPC is a potential neuroprotectant with prosurvival effects in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.

TI  - Endocrine, immune and renal toxicity in male largemouth bass after chronic exposure to glyphosate and Rodeo®.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Glyphosate is the most used herbicide worldwide, with no historical comparison. It is used for genetically modified crops, and particularly in Florida, it is used as a sugar cane ripener. An aquatic formulation (Rodeo®) is used to treat aquatic weeds in waterbodies and drainage canals. Because of its extended use, glyphosate can run off or be sprayed directly into waterbodies, and chronically expose aquatic wildlife. Exposure in animal models has been associated with kidney and liver damage and glyphosate has been suggested as an endocrine disruptor. We exposed adult male largemouth bass for 21 days to two doses of glyphosate and Rodeo® (chemically equivalent concentration of glyphosate) at 0.5 mg L(-1) and 10 mg L(-1) and to a clean water control (n=4 fish/tank in quadruplicate). Concentrations during the experiment were corroborated with UHPLC-MS/MS. Total RNA was isolated from the trunk kidney and head kidney. RNA-seq was performed for the high doses compared to controls. Transcripts were analyzed with fish and mammalian pathway analyses software. Transcripts mapped to Zebrafish metabolic pathways using PaintOmics showed steroid hormone biosynthesis in the trunk kidney as the most significantly enriched pathway. Steroid hormones were measured in plasma by UHPLC-MS/MS. Total androgens were significantly reduced at 0.5 mg L(-1) of glyphosate and at equivalent concentrations in Rodeo® compared to controls. 11-ketotestosterone and estrone concentrations were significantly reduced in all doses. A gene involved in the conversion of testosterone to 11-ketotestosterone was down-regulated by glyphosate. Using the mammalian pathway analysis algorithm, cellular processes associated with T-cell activation/development and intracellular pH were significantly enriched in the trunk kidney by glyphosate and Rodeo® exposure. Endocrine disruption was corroborated at the hormone and gene expression levels. Rodeo® and glyphosate share gene expression pathways, however, Rodeo® had more pronounced effects in largemouth bass.

TI  - Transcriptomic and targeted metabolomic analysis revealed the toxic effects of prochloraz on larval zebrafish.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Prochloraz (PCZ), an imidazole fungicide, has been extensively used in horticulture and agriculture to protect against pests and diseases. To investigate the potential toxicity of PCZ on aquatic organisms, larval zebrafish, as a model, were exposed to a series of concentrations (0, 20, 100, and 500 μg/L) of PCZ for 7 days. With transcriptomic analysis, we found that exposure to high dose PCZ could produce 76 downregulated and 345 upregulated differential expression genes (DEGs). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of the DEGs were characterized in the pathways of glycolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. Targeted metabolomic analysis was conducted to verify the effects of PCZ on the levels of acyl-carnitines and some amino acids in larval zebrafish. In addition, biochemical indicators related to glycolipid metabolism were affected obviously, manifested as elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and decreased glucose (Glu) levels in whole larvae. The expression levels of genes associated with glycolipid metabolism were affected in larvae after exposure to PCZ (PK, GK, PEPckc, SREBP, ACO). Interestingly, we further confirmed that PCZ could induce oxidative stress by the changing enzyme activities (T-GSH, GSSG) and upregulating several related genes levels in larval zebrafish. Generally, our results revealed that the endpoints related to glycolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress were influenced by PCZ in larval zebrafish.

TI  - Adverse outcome pathways during zebrafish embryogenesis: a case study with paraoxon.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Using paraoxon as a reference acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, the objective of this study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that provided quantitative linkages across levels of biological organization during zebrafish embryogenesis. Within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated that ache transcripts and AChE activity increased in a stage-dependent manner following segmentation. We then showed that static exposure of embryos to paraoxon (31.2-500 nM) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and concentration-dependent AChE inhibition, albeit these effects were fully reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the presence of significant AChE inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon concentrations (≤250 nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron development at 96 hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal AChE expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon concentrations as low as 31.2 nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal AChE activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that may be independent of AChE inhibition. Using a well-studied reference chemical, this study highlights the potential challenges in developing quantitative AOPs to support chemical screening and prioritization strategies.

TI  - Development and bioorthogonal activation of palladium-labile prodrugs of gemcitabine.
T2  - Journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - Bioorthogonal chemistry has become one of the main driving forces in current chemical biology, inspiring the search for novel biocompatible chemospecific reactions for the past decade. Alongside the well-established labeling strategies that originated the bioorthogonal paradigm, we have recently proposed the use of heterogeneous palladium chemistry and bioorthogonal Pd(0)-labile prodrugs to develop spatially targeted therapies. Herein, we report the generation of biologically inert precursors of cytotoxic gemcitabine by introducing Pd(0)-cleavable groups in positions that are mechanistically relevant for gemcitabine's pharmacological activity. Cell viability studies in pancreatic cancer cells showed that carbamate functionalization of the 4-amino group of gemcitabine significantly reduced (\textgreater23-fold) the prodrugs' cytotoxicity. The N-propargyloxycarbonyl (N-Poc) promoiety displayed the highest sensitivity to heterogeneous palladium catalysis under biocompatible conditions, with a reaction half-life of less than 6 h. Zebrafish studies with allyl, propargyl, and benzyl carbamate-protected rhodamines confirmed N-Poc as the most suitable masking group for implementing in vivo bioorthogonal organometallic chemistry.

TI  - Nano-TiO(2) aggravates bioaccumulation and developmental neurotoxicity of triphenyl phosphate in zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - This study explored the combined effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO(2)) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) on the neurodevelopment of zebrafish larvae as well as the underlying mechanisms. With this regard, zebrafish embryos were exposed to nano-TiO(2) of 100 μg·L(-1), TPhP of 0, 8, 24, 72, and 144 μg·L(-1), or their combinations until 120 h post-fertilization (hpf). Results indicated 100 μg·L(-1) nano-TiO(2) alone to be nontoxic to zebrafish larvae. However, obvious developmental toxicity manifested as inhibition of surviving rate, heart rate and body length as well as increased malformation was observed in the higher concentrations of TPhP (72 and 144 μg·L(-1)) alone and the co-exposure groups. Additionally, results suggested that nano-TiO(2) significantly enhanced the bioaccumulation of TPhP in zebtafish larvae, and thus aggravated the abnormities of spontaneous movement and swimming behavior in zebrafish larvae induced by TPhP. Nano-TiO(2) also exacerbated the TPhP-induced inhibition of the axonal growth on the secondary motor neuron, and aggravated the TPhP-induced decrease on expressions of neuron-specific green fluorescent protein (GFP) and neuronal marker genes (ngn1 and elavl3). Further, the content of neurotransmitter serotonin was not altered by TPhP alone exposure, but was decreased significantly in the co-exposure group of 144 μg·L(-1) TPhP and nano-TiO(2). Our data indicated that nano-TiO(2) might aggravate the neuron abnormities and serotonin system dysfunction by enhancing the TPhP accumulation, leading to exacerbated abnormal locomotors in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - MPTP and MPP+ target specific aminergic cell populations in larval zebrafish.
T2  - Journal of neurochemistry
AB  - Larval zebrafish offers a good model to approach brain disease mechanisms, as structural abnormalities of their small brains can be correlated to quantifiable behavior. In this study, the structural alterations in one diencephalic dopaminergic nucleus induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a toxin inducing Parkinson's disease in humans, and those found in several neuronal groups after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the pretoxin, were associated with decreased swimming speed. Detailed cell counts of dopaminergic groups indicated a transient decline of tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons up to about 50% after MPTP. The MPTP effect was partly sensitive to monoamine oxidase inhibitor deprenyl. Detailed analysis of the developing catecholaminergic cell groups suggests that the cell groups emerged at their final positions and no obvious significant migration from the original positions was seen. One 5-HT neuron group was also affected by MPTP treatment, whereas other groups remained intact, suggesting that the effect is selective. New nomenclature for developing catecholaminergic cell groups corresponding to adult groups is introduced. The diencephalic cell population consisting of groups 5,6 and 11 was sensitive to both MPTP and MPP+ and in this respect resembles mammalian substantia nigra. The results suggest that MPTP and MPP+ induce a transient functional deficit and motility disorder in larval zebrafish.

T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Mixed-sex populations of young adult zebrafish (\textasciitilde2-month-old) were exposed to measured RDX concentrations of 0, 1 or 9.6 ppm for up to 12 weeks followed by a 15-day rearing period in untreated water. RDX caused high mortality at 9.6 ppm, with most deaths occurring within the first 8 weeks of exposure. RDX at 9.6 ppm caused lower body weights at 4 and 8 weeks of exposure; and at 1 ppm, lower body weight was observed only at 4 weeks. Fish length was not affected by treatment at any time during the exposure period. The bioconcentration factor for RDX seemed to be influenced by time of exposure but not by water RDX concentration; its overall values were 1.01+/-0.13, 0.91+/-0.06 and 2.23+/-0.04 at 4, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. RDX was not detected in fish collected after the 15-day recovery period. In a separate experiment, adult females and males were separately exposed to RDX at measured concentrations of 0, 0.5 and 3.2 ppm for a period of 6 weeks. Reproductive performance was evaluated by biweekly breeding of the fish and measuring packed-egg volume (PEV) as index of fecundity. At 0.5 ppm, RDX caused elevated PEV levels relative to the control value at 2 weeks but not at 4 or 6 weeks, whereas no significant effects were noted at 3.2 ppm. Egg fertilization and embryo hatching rates were not affected by RDX at any of the concentrations tested. In conclusion, RDX at sublethal concentrations causes short-term negative effects on growth and, at 0.5 ppm, positive effects on fecundity.

TI  - Carboxyl-functionalized polyurethane nanoparticles with immunosuppressive properties as a new type of anti-inflammatory platform.
T2  - Nanoscale
AB  - The interaction of nanoparticles (NPs) with the body immune system is critically important for their biomedical applications. Most NPs stimulate the immune response of macrophages. Here we show that synthetic polyurethane nanoparticles (PU NPs, diameter 34-64 nm) with rich surface COO(-) functional groups (zeta potential -70 to -50 mV) can suppress the immune response of macrophages. The specially-designed PU NPs reduce the gene expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) for endotoxin-treated macrophages. The PU NPs increase the intracellular calcium of macrophages (4.5-6.5 fold) and activate autophagy. This is in contrast to the autophagy dysfunction generally observed upon NP exposure. These PU NPs may further decrease the nuclear factor-κB-related inflammation via autophagy pathways. The immunosuppressive activities of PU NPs can prevent animal death by inhibiting the macrophage recruitment and proinflammatory responses, confirmed by an in vivo zebrafish model. Therefore, the novel biodegradable PU NPs demonstrate COO(-) dependent immunosuppressive properties without carrying any anti-inflammatory agents. This study suggests that NP surface chemistry may regulate the immune response, which provides a new paradigm for potential applications of NPs in anti-inflammation and immunomodulation.

TI  - Surviving in a toxic world: transcriptomics and gene expression profiling in response to environmental pollution in the critically endangered European eel.
T2  - BMC genomics
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomic and transcriptomic approaches have the potential for unveiling the genome-wide response to environmental perturbations. The abundance of the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has been declining since the 1980s probably due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors. In this paper, we explore the transcriptomic dynamics between individuals from high (river Tiber, Italy) and low pollution (lake Bolsena, Italy) environments, which were measured for 36 PCBs, several organochlorine pesticides and brominated flame retardants and nine metals. RESULTS: To this end, we first (i) updated the European eel transcriptome using deep sequencing data with a total of 640,040 reads assembled into 44,896 contigs (Eeelbase release 2.0), and (ii) developed a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the critically endangered European eel of about 15,000 annotated contigs, which was applied to detect differentially expressed genes between polluted sites. Several detoxification genes related to metabolism of pollutants were upregulated in the highly polluted site, including genes that take part in phase I of the xenobiotic metabolism (CYP3A), phase II (glutathione-S-transferase) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase). In addition, key genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated at the Tiber site relative to the Bolsena site. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the induced high expression of detoxification genes, the suggested lowered expression of genes supposedly involved in metabolism suggests that pollution may also be associated with decreased respiratory and energy production.

TI  - Long term exposure to tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) causes alterations in reproductive hormones, vitellogenin, antioxidant enzymes, and histology of gonads in zebrafish (Danio rerio): In vivo and computational analysis.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - In aquatic milieus, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) was detected as an emerging environmental contaminant. In this study, in vivo experiment and in-silico docking was integrated systematically to explore the toxic mechanisms of TCEP using zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish (mean weight of 0.24 ± 0.02 g) were exposed to 100 and 1500 μg L(-1) concentrations of TCEP for 28 days under the static renewal method. During chronic exposure, plasma steroid hormones such as testosterone (T) and 17β estradiol (E2), plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in gonads were significantly (P \textless 0.05) altered in TCEP exposed group (1500 μg L(-1)) compared to the control group. However, the alterations of these parameters were not significant on the 14th day (except Vtg and GR in testis) in 100 μg L(-1) of TCEP exposed groups. There were no significant differences (p \textgreater 0.05) in the growth parameters comparing TCEP exposed groups with the control group. The gonads of fish exposed to TCEP showed significant histopathological changes when compared to the control groups. A docking study observed that TCEP possessed binding affinity with the estrogen receptor (ERβ) and androgen receptor (AR). These data indicate that TCEP at tested concentrations adversely affects the aquatic organisms.

TI  - Hepatic steatosis in zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio) induced by long-term exposure to gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - In a full life cycle test, newly hatched eggs of zebra fish, Brachydanio rerio, were reared to sexual maturity under continuous exposure to 40, 80, 110, 130, and 150 micrograms/liter lindane, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane. The effects of lindane were investigated by recording behavior and survival of the F0- and F1-generation as well as morphological alterations in liver ultrastructure of F0. Changes in peroxisomes were visualized by cytochemical staining for catalase activity with diaminobenzidine. Whereas behavioral changes can already be observed at 40 micrograms/liter, survival and number of eggs in F0 as well as survival and growth of F1 are unaffected by up to 80 micrograms/liter lindane. At concentrations greater than or equal to 110 micrograms/liter, survival of larvae is reduced already after 35 days, and mortality is 100% after 3 months. From 40 micrograms/liter, liver ultrastructure displays a microvesicular fatty vacuolation (steatosis) characterized by lipid deposition within the cisternae of the RER. At 40 micrograms/liter, this highly specific pathological change is accompanied by accumulation of hepatic macrovesicular triglyceride droplets, glycogen depletion, and the occurrence of club-shaped mitochondria. Additional alterations at 80 micrograms/liter comprise proliferation of SER in males and progressive fractionation of RER in females, stacking of club-shaped mitochondria, a conspicuous decrease in peroxisomal catalase activity, infiltration of macrophages into the liver parenchyma, and a significant stimulation of hepatocytic mitosis. Among several substances tested so far in zebra fish (4-nitrophenol, 4-chloroaniline 3,4-dichloroaniline, atrazine, lindane), lindane is the only compound inducing behavioral changes and hepatic steatosis in conjunction with a reduction in fertility. With regard to the relative sensitivity of the methods applied, behavioral and cytological studies appear more responsive to lindane exposure than survival studies.

TI  - Zebrafish as a neurotoxicological model.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - At a time when common regulatory pathways are being identified in several different species and genomics is beginning to allow comparisons of genes, how they are arranged on chromosomes and how they are regulated, zebrafish has emerged as a valuable and complementary vertebrate model. Some of the characteristics that prove of value are described and illustrated. Fluorescent transgenic lines of zebrafish embryos are presented for time-line studies with neurotoxicants. While genetic knockout technology has yet to be developed for the model, the anti-sense, morpholino approach allows for knockdown of expression of genes for the 3 day, embryonic period. This can provide for phenocopies of mutant genes for those genes essential to embryonic development or it can provide for a limited inhibition of gene expression that allows subsequent development of the fish. With the zebrafish genomic sequencing effort, microarray technology is now developing for the model system. These resources and technologies allow one to challenge the system with toxicants, and to view the immediate effects of the toxicants with transgenic embryos that fluoresce in part or all of the nervous system. Behavioral and learning protocols have been developed for the organism so that early exposures can be assayed for effects upon adult fish. Microarray technology should allow for one to identify specific genes and pathways affected by a neurotoxicant. In the future, these approaches should provide a working protocol for exploring molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicants. This type of complementary approach should then allow for more efficient examination and testing of mechanisms in mammalian models.

TI  - PCB1254 exposure contributes to the abnormalities of optomotor responses and influence of the photoreceptor cell development in zebrafish larvae.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of highly toxic environmental pollutants, have been report to influence the visual system development in children. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. The study was aim to investigate the effects of continuous PCBs exposure on optomotor response (OMR) and retinal photoreceptor cell development-related gene expression in zebrafish larvae. The fertilized zebrafish embryos were exposed to PCBs at concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1mg/L until 7 days post-fertilization. Control groups with blank and 0.01% methanol were also prepared. OMR test was used to detect the visual behavior. The mRNA expression of the CRX, RHO, SWS1, and SWS2 was assessed by the Quantitative Real-Time PCR. The OMR test showed that the visual behavior of the larvae was most sensitive when the grating spatial frequency was 0.20LP/mm and the moving speed was 25cm/s. Moreover, the proportion of positively swimming fish was significantly reduced in the 0.5 and 1mg/L PCB1254 treatment group (P\textless0.05) compared with the controls. In addition, the expression of SWS2 was significantly down-regulated in all PCB1254 treatment groups (P\textless0.05), whereas the decreased expression of the CRX, RHO and SWS1 was found in the 0.5 and 1mg/L PCB1254 groups (P\textless0.05). This is the first report to demonstrate that continue exposure of zebrafish larvae to PCBs causes photoreceptor cell development-related gene expression changes that lead to OMR behavioral alterations. Analysis of these visual behavioral paradigms may be useful in predicting the adverse effects of toxicants on visual function in fish.

TI  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate disrupts the trajectory of cytosine methylation within developing zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental research
AB  - Tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) is an organophosphate ester-based flame retardant widely used within the United States. Within zebrafish, initiation of TDCIPP exposure at 0.75 h post-fertilization (hpf) reliably disrupts cytosine methylation from cleavage (2 hpf) through early-gastrulation (6 hpf). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether TDCIPP-induced effects on cytosine methylation persist beyond 6 hpf. First, we exposed embryos to vehicle or TDCIPP from 0.75 hpf to 6, 24, or 48 hpf, and then conducted bisulfite amplicon sequencing of a target locus (lmo7b) using genomic DNA derived from whole embryos. Within both vehicle- and TDCIPP-treated embryos, CpG methylation was similar at 6 hpf and CHG/CHH methylation were similar at 24 and 48 hpf (relative to 6 hpf). However, relative to 6 hpf within the same treatment, CpG methylation was lower within vehicle-treated embryos at 48 hpf and TDCIPP-treated embryos at 24 and 48 hpf - an effect that was driven by acceleration of CpG hypomethylation. Similar to our previous findings with DNA methyltransferase, we found that, even at high μM concentrations, TDCIPP had no effect on zebrafish and human thymine DNA glycosylase activity (a key enzyme that decreases CpG methylation), suggesting that TDCIPP-induced effects on CpG methylation are not driven by direct interaction with thymine DNA glycosylase. Finally, using 5-methylcytosine (5-mC)-specific whole-mount immunochemistry and automated imaging, we found that exposure to TDCIPP increased 5-mC abundance within the yolk of blastula-stage embryos, suggesting that TDCIPP may impact cytosine methylation of maternally loaded mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Overall, our findings suggest that TDCIPP disrupts the trajectory of cytosine methylation during zebrafish embryogenesis, effects which do not appear to be driven by direct interaction of TDCIPP with key enzymes that regulate cytosine methylation.

TI  - Predicting adult fish acute lethality with the zebrafish embryo: relevance of test duration, endpoints, compound properties, and exposure concentration analysis.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - The zebrafish embryo toxicity test has been proposed as an alternative for the acute fish toxicity test, which is required by various regulations for environmental risk assessment of chemicals. We investigated the reliability of the embryo test by probing organic industrial chemicals with a wide range of physicochemical properties, toxicities, and modes of toxic action. Moreover, the relevance of using measured versus nominal (intended) exposure concentrations, inclusion of sublethal endpoints, and different exposure durations for the comparability with reported fish acute toxicity was explored. Our results confirm a very strong correlation of zebrafish embryo to fish acute toxicity. When toxicity values were calculated based on measured exposure concentrations, the slope of the type II regression line was 1 and nearly passed through the origin (1 to 1 correlation). Measured concentrations also explained several apparent outliers. Neither prolonged exposure (up to 120 h) nor consideration of sublethal effects led to a reduced number of outliers. Yet, two types of compounds were less lethal to embryos than to adult fish: a neurotoxic compound acting via sodium channels (permethrin) and a compound requiring metabolic activation (allyl alcohol).

TI  - Effects of microplastics and food particles on organic pollutants bioaccumulation in equi-fugacity and above-fugacity scenarios.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Microplastics (MPs), as emerging contaminants, sorb organic pollutants from the environment or leach out additives, thereby altering the fate of co-existing pollutants to organisms. We chose equi-fugacity and above-fugacity concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as background contamination and plastic additive concentrations, respectively, to investigate the effects of MPs on PCB bioaccumulation; we compared the effects of MPs with those of food-borne particles (FBPs). Co-exposure to MPs and FBPs at both the equi-fugacity and above-fugacity PCB concentrations had no obvious toxic effects (ROS generation and cyp1a expression) on zebrafish. When the zebrafish were exposed to the equi-fugacity PCB concentrations, the PCB concentrations reached 177.7-400.5 ng/g after a 7-d uptake; the presence of MPs did not significantly enhance PCB bioaccumulation. The remaining PCB concentrations in the fish after a 4-d depuration were 58.4-125.1 ng/g; the effects of MPs were the same as those during the uptake period. However, at the above-fugacity PCB concentrations, the MPs markedly increased the PCB bioaccumulation (by 1.8-fold) to 712.9 ng/g. This is because at above-fugacity concentrations, PCBs on MPs migrate to organisms as there were high fugacity gradients. The FBPs enhanced PCB bioaccumulation in zebrafish more effectively than the MPs, even after depuration. In the presence of FBPs, PCB bioaccumulation increased by 2.8- and 4.2- fold after uptake in the equi-fugacity and above-fugacity scenarios, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than that observed for the MPs. This is probably because FBPs are easily assimilated by fish, making the associated PCBs more bioavailable. Finally, during the co-existence of MPs and FBPs, MPs facilitate the depuration of PCBs accumulated via FBP vectors; conversely, FBPs did not affect PCB accumulation via MP vectors. Thus, this study elucidated the effects of MPs and FBPs on the bioaccumulation of pollutants at equi-fugacity or above-fugacity concentrations in aquatic environments.

TI  - 3D bioprinting of neural stem cell-laden thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane hydrogel and potential in central nervous system repair.
T2  - Biomaterials
AB  - The 3D bioprinting technology serves as a powerful tool for building tissue in the field of tissue engineering. Traditional 3D printing methods involve the use of heat, toxic organic solvents, or toxic photoinitiators for fabrication of synthetic scaffolds. In this study, two thermoresponsive water-based biodegradable polyurethane dispersions (PU1 and PU2) were synthesized which may form gel near 37 °C without any crosslinker. The stiffness of the hydrogel could be easily fine-tuned by the solid content of the dispersion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) were embedded into the polyurethane dispersions before gelation. The dispersions containing NSCs were subsequently printed and maintained at 37 °C. The NSCs in 25-30% PU2 hydrogels (∼680-2400 Pa) had excellent proliferation and differentiation but not in 25-30% PU1 hydrogels. Moreover, NSC-laden 25-30% PU2 hydrogels injected into the zebrafish embryo neural injury model could rescue the function of impaired nervous system. However, NSC-laden 25-30% PU1 hydrogels only showed a minor repair effect in the zebrafish model. In addition, the function of adult zebrafish with traumatic brain injury was rescued after implantation of the 3D-printed NSC-laden 25% PU2 constructs. Therefore, the newly developed 3D bioprinting technique involving NSCs embedded in the thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane ink offers new possibilities for future applications of 3D bioprinting in neural tissue engineering.

TI  - Triphenyl phosphate-induced pericardial edema is associated with elevated epidermal ionocytes within zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is an organophosphate ester-based plasticizer and flame retardant. The objective of this study was to identify the potential role of epidermal ionocytes in mediating TPHP-induced pericardial edema within zebrafish embryos. Exposure to TPHP from 24 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) resulted in a significant increase in pericardial edema and the number of ionocytes at 72 hpf relative to time-matched embryos treated with vehicle. In addition, co-exposure of embryos to mannitol (an osmotic diuretic) blocked TPHP-induced pericardial edema and effects on ionocyte abundance. However, knockdown of ATPase1a1.4 - an abundant Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase localized to epidermal ionocytes - mitigated TPHP-induced effects on ionocyte abundance but not pericardial edema, whereas co-exposure of embryos to ouabain - a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor - enhanced TPHP-induced pericardial edema but not ionocyte abundance. Overall, our findings suggest that TPHP may have multiple mechanisms of toxicity leading to an increase in ionocyte abundance and pericardial edema within developing zebrafish embryos.

TI  - Influence of microplastics on the bioconcentration of organic contaminants in fish: Is the "Trojan horse" effect a matter of concern?
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have been shown to act as sorbent phases and thus carriers of organic chemicals in the aquatic environment. Therefore, concerns exist that MP ingestion increases the uptake and accumulation of organic chemicals by aquatic organisms. However, it is unclear if this pathway is relevant compared to other exposure pathways. Here we compared the bioconcentration capacity of two hydrophobic organic chemicals (i.e., chlorpyrifos and hexachlorobenzene) in a freshwater fish (Danio rerio) when exposed to chemicals through water only and in combination with contaminated polyethylene MPs. Additionally, a suite of biomarker analyses (acetylcholine esterase, glutathione S-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, catalase) was carried out to test whether MPs can enhance the toxic stress caused by chemicals. Two 14-day semi-static experiments (one for each chemical) were carried out with adult fish. Each experiment consisted of (1) a control treatment (no chemicals, no MPs); (2) a treatment in which fish were exposed to chlorpyrifos or hexachlorobenzene only through water; (3) a treatment in which fish were exposed to the chemicals through water and contaminated polyethylene MPs (100 mg MP/L). Two additional treatments were included for the biomarker analysis. These contained MPs at two different concentrations (5 and 100 mg MP/L) but no chemicals. The presence of contaminated MPs in contaminated water did not enhance but rather decreased the bioconcentration of both chemicals in fish compared to the treatment that contained contaminated water in absence of MPs. This was more pronounced for hexachlorobenzene, which is more hydrophobic than chlorpyrifos. Enzyme activity levels in fish were only significantly altered in the presence of MPs for alkaline phosphatase. This study indicates that MP presence in freshwater ecosystems is not expected to increase the risks associated with chemical bioconcentration in aquatic organisms and that other exposure pathways (i.e., uptake via respiration, skin permeability) may be of higher importance.

TI  - Aging relieves the promotion effects of polyamide microplastics on parental transfer and developmental toxicity of TDCIPP to zebrafish offspring.
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - Understanding the role of microplastics (MPs) in the biological fate and toxicity of organic pollutants in food webs is vital for its risk assessment. However, contradictory results and the neglect of MP aging as a factor have led to a research gap, which needs to be filled. Our study discovered that polyamide (PA, a ubiquitous MP in water) MPs clearly facilitated bioaccumulation of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) in the F0 zebrafish gonads and parental transfer of TDCIPP to the F1 offspring. Rapid TDCIPP desorption in the gut and intestine barrier dysfunction triggered by MPs were the causes for the phenomenon. In contrast to the pristine forms, aged PA with higher hydrophilcity exhibited stronger binding and polar interactions with TDCIPP, and the intestine damage was neglectable, resulting in increased intestinal immobilization and prevented parental transfer of TDCIPP. Additionally, the aggravated body weight loss and decreased length of TDCIPP offspring were relieved after PA aging. The recovery of subintestinal venous plexus angiogenesis, yolk lipid utilization, and ATP synthesis were responsible for the mitigated transgenerational toxicity. Our results highlight the significance of aging on the role of MPs with respect to coexisting pollutants and have great implications for understanding MP-associated risks.

TI  - A Novel Gelatin-Based Sustained-Release Molluscicide for Control of the Invasive Agricultural Pest and Disease Vector Pomacea canaliculata.
T2  - Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Pomacea canaliculata, one of the 100 most destructive invasive species in the world, and it is an important intermediate host of Angiostrongylus cantonensis. The molluscicides in current use are an effective method for controlling snails. However, most molluscicides have no slow-release effect and are toxic to nontarget organisms. Thus, these molluscicides cannot be used on a large scale to effectively act on snails. In this study, gelatin, a safe and nontoxic substance, was combined with sustained-release molluscicide and was found to reduce the toxicity of niclosamide to nontarget organisms. We assessed the effects of gelatin and molluscicide in controlling P. canaliculata snails and eggs. The results demonstrated that the niclosamide retention time with 1.0% and 1.5% gelatin sustained-release agents reached 20 days. Additionally, the mortality rate of P. canaliculata and their eggs increased as the concentration of the niclosamide sustained-release agents increased. The adult mortality rate of P. canaliculata reached 50% after the snails were exposed to gelatin with 0.1 mg/L niclosamide for 48 h. The hatching rate of P. canaliculata was only 28.5% of the normal group after the treatment was applied. The sustained-release molluscicide at this concentration was less toxic to zebrafish, which means that this molluscicide can increase the safety of niclosamide to control P. canaliculata in aquatic environments. In this study, we explored the safety of using niclosamide sustained-release agents with gelatin against P. canaliculata. The results suggest that gelatin is an ideal sustained-release agent that can provide a foundation for subsequent improvements in control of P. canaliculata.

TI  - Desalting of phosphopeptides by tandem polypyrrole-c18 reverse phase micropipette tip (TMTip(PPY-C18)) based on hybrid electrostatic, Π-Π stacking and hydrophobic interactions for mass spectrometric analysis.
T2  - Analytica chimica acta
AB  - Desalting and concentration of peptides using reverse phase (RP) C18 chromatographic material based on hydrophobic interaction is a routine approach used in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. However, MS detection of small hydrophilic peptides, in particular, phosphopeptides that bear multiple negative charges, is challenging due to the insufficient binding to C18 stationary phase. We described here the development of a new desalting method that takes the unique properties of polypyrrole (PPY). The presence of positively charged nitrogen atoms under acidic conditions and polyunsaturated bonds in polypyrrole provide a prospect for enhanced adsorption of phosphopeptides or hydrophilic peptides through extra electrostatic and Π-Π stacking interactions in addition to hydrophobic interactions. In tandem with reversed phase C18 chromatographic material, the new type of desalting method termed as TMTip(PPY-C18) can significantly improve the MS detection of phosphopeptides with multiple phosphate groups and other small hydrophilic peptides. It has been applied to not only tryptic digest of model proteins but also the analysis of complex lysates of zebrafish eggs. The number of detected phosphate groups on a peptide ranged from 1 to 6. Particularly, polypyrrole based method can also be used in basic condition. Thus it provides a useful means to handle peptides that may not be detectable in acidic condition. It can be envisioned that the TMTip(PPY-C18) should be able to facilitate the exploration of large scale phosphoproteome.

TI  - [Exploration of developmental toxicity mechanism of pentachlorophenol using cDNA microarray].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
AB  - 0hpf zebrafish embryos were exposed to 50 microg/L pentachlorophenol(PCP) for 8h in vitro. Total RNA sample was extracted then and hybridized with Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array representing approximately 14 900 transcripts. A total of 1 149 transcripts was significantly up-regulated while 501 transcripts were down-regulated. Bioinformatic tools were used for further analysis. The result indicated that genes with significant expression changes were related to molecular functions including antioxidant activity, signal transducer activity, translation regulator activity, transcription regulator activity, et al. Genes regulated by BMP signals, FGF signals, and Nodal signals including smad2, smad5, bmp4, bmp7, flh, n-ras may involve in the developmental toxicity of PCP, with Signal log ratios of 4.6, 2.1, 1.6, 1.0, 1, 1.3, 1.0, respectively. This investigation may provide new biomarkers to further study of the developmental toxicity of PCP.

TI  - Functional Inhibition of Host Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) Enhances in vitro and in vivo Anti-mycobacterial Activity in Human Macrophages and in Zebrafish.
T2  - Frontiers in immunology
AB  - The rapid and persistent increase of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections poses increasing global problems in combatting tuberculosis (TB), prompting for the development of alternative strategies including host-directed therapy (HDT). Since Mtb is an intracellular pathogen with a remarkable ability to manipulate host intracellular signaling pathways to escape from host defense, pharmacological reprogramming of the immune system represents a novel, potentially powerful therapeutic strategy that should be effective also against drug-resistant Mtb. Here, we found that host-pathogen interactions in Mtb-infected primary human macrophages affected host epigenetic features by modifying histone deacetylase (HDAC) transcriptomic levels. In addition, broad spectrum inhibition of HDACs enhanced the antimicrobial response of both pro-inflammatory macrophages (Mϕ1) and anti-inflammatory macrophages (Mϕ2), while selective inhibition of class IIa HDACs mainly decreased bacterial outgrowth in Mϕ2. Moreover, chemical inhibition of HDAC activity during differentiation polarized macrophages into a more bactericidal phenotype with a concomitant decrease in the secretion levels of inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, in vivo chemical inhibition of HDAC activity in Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish embryos, a well-characterized animal model for tuberculosis, significantly reduced mycobacterial burden, validating our in vitro findings in primary human macrophages. Collectively, these data identify HDACs as druggable host targets for HDT against intracellular Mtb.

TI  - Identification of novel antiangiogenic anticancer activities of deguelin targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha.
T2  - International journal of cancer
AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays an essential role in tumor angiogenesis and growth by regulating the transcription of several genes in response to hypoxic stress and changes in growth factors. This study was designed to investigate the effects of deguelin on tumor growth and angiogenesis, and the mechanisms underlying the antitumor activities of deguelin. We show here that orally administered deguelin inhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor angiogenesis in mice. Deguelin decreased expression of HIF-1alpha protein and its target genes, such as VEGF, in a subset of cancer cell lines, including H1299 lung cancer cells, and vascular endothelial cells in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor by adenoviral vector infection abolished the antiangiogenic effects of deguelin on H1299 nonsmall cell lung cancer cells. Deguelin inhibited de novo synthesis of HIF-1alpha protein and reduced the half-life of the synthesized protein. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, protected the hypoxia- or IGF-induced HIF-1alpha protein from deguelin-mediated degradation. Our findings suggest that deguelin is a promising antiangiogenic therapeutic agent in cancer targeting HIF-1alpha. Considering that HIF-1alpha is overexpressed in a majority of human cancers, deguelin could offer a potent therapeutic agent for cancer.

TI  - Effects of cyhalofop-butyl on the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Cyhalofop-butyl is a kind of aromatic phenoxypropionic acid herbicide widely used in agriculture. However, studies on its immunotoxicity to aquatic organisms have not been reported. In this study paper, morphological, immunological, cytological, biochemical and molecular biology methods were used to study the effects of cyhalofop-butyl on the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity in zebrafish. After cyhalofop-butyl exposed, the results showed that the zebrafish embryos had shorter length, yolk sac edema, significantly reduced number of immune cells, inflammatory response and immunocytes apoptosis. In addition, we found that the expression of immune-related genes and pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway mediated the immunotoxicity induced by cyhalofop-butyl. Therefore, our results indicate that cyhalofop-butyl has developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity to zebrafish, and this study offer new contents for the effects of cyhalofop-butyl exposure on aquatic organisms.

TI  - Niclosamide Induces Epiboly Delay During Early Zebrafish Embryogenesis.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Niclosamide is an antihelminthic drug used worldwide for the treatment of tapeworm infections. Recent drug repurposing screens have revealed that niclosamide exhibits diverse mechanisms of action and, as a result, demonstrates promise for a number of applications, including the treatment of cancer, bacterial infections, and Zika virus. As new applications of niclosamide will require non-oral delivery routes that may lead to exposure in utero, the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of niclosamide toxicity during early stages of embryonic development. Using zebrafish as a model, we found that niclosamide induced a concentration-dependent delay in epiboly progression during late-blastula and early-gastrula, an effect that was dependent on exposure during the maternal-to-zygotic transition-a period characterized by degradation of maternally derived transcripts, zygotic genome activation, and initiation of cell motility. Moreover, we found that niclosamide did not affect embryonic oxygen consumption, suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation-a well-established target for niclosamide within intestinal parasites-may not play a role in niclosamide-induced epiboly delay. However, mRNA-sequencing revealed that niclosamide exposure during blastula and early-gastrula significantly impacted the timing of zygotic genome activation as well as the abundance of cytoskeleton- and cell cycle regulation-specific transcripts. In addition, we found that niclosamide inhibited tubulin polymerization in vitro, suggesting that niclosamide-induced delays in epiboly progression may, in part, be driven by disruption of microtubule formation and cell motility within the developing embryo.

TI  - The neuroprotective effects of Galectin-1 on Parkinson's Disease via regulation of Nrf2 expression.
T2  - European review for medical and pharmacological sciences
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is expressed in the central nervous system. Our study sought to explore the neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 in 1‑methyl‑4‑phenyl pyridine ion (MPP+)-induced cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in vitro, pretreated with Gal-1, and then exposed to MPP+. Thereafter, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells was investigated. The effects of Gal-1 on DNA breakage, cell damage (release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), viability, and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells were examined by comet assay, LDH assay, WST-1 assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. Additionally, the regulatory effect of Gal-1 on Nrf2 expression was examined by western blot. Zebrafish embryos were pretreated with Gal-1 and then exposed to MPP+. The locomotor ability of zebrafish larvae was then investigated. RESULTS: MPP+ induced the production of ROS in cells, which can be alleviated by pretreatment with Gal-1. Gal-1 protected cells from MPP+-induced cytotoxicity by preventing DNA breakage and cell injury. Gal-1 inhibited apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 could be abolished when Nrf2 expression knockdown. Moreover, exposure to MPP+ decreased the locomotor activity of zebrafish, which was attenuated by pretreatment with Gal-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the administration of Gal-1 could protect neurons from cellular stress by preventing apoptosis and eliminating ROS. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 in neuronal cells could be related to the activation of Nrf2 expression. Therefore, Gal-1 could be a promising strategy for treating PD.

TI  - Examining multi- and transgenerational behavioral and molecular alterations resulting from parental exposure to an environmental PCB and PBDE mixture.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent organic pollutants extensively used during the 20(th) century and still present in aquatic environments despite their ban. Effects of exposure to these compounds over generations are poorly documented. Therefore, our aims were to characterize behavioral responses and underlying molecular mechanisms in zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs and PBDEs as well as in four unexposed offspring generations. Zebrafish (F0) were chronically exposed from the first meal onward to a diet spiked with a mixture containing 22 PCB and 7 PBDE congeners in proportions and concentrations reflecting environmental situations (ΣPCBs = 1991 and ΣPBDEs = 411 ng/g). Four offspring generations (F1 to F4) were obtained from this F0 and were not further exposed. Behavior was assessed at both larval and adult stages. Mechanisms related to behavioral defects (habenula maturation and c-fos transcription) and methylation (dnmts transcription) were monitored in larvae. Exposed adult F0 as well as F1 and F3 adults displayed no behavioral change while F2 expressed anxiety-like behavior. Larval behavior was also disrupted, i.e. hyperactive after light to dark transition in F1 or hypoactive in F2, F3 and F4. Behavioral disruptions may be related to defect in habenula maturation (observed in F1) and change in c-fos transcription (observed in F1 and F2). Transcription of the gene encoding DNA methyltransferase (dnmt3ba) was also modified in all generations. Our results lead us to hypothesize that chronic dietary exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCB and PBDE triggers multigenerational and transgenerational molecular and behavioral disruptions in a vertebrate model.

TI  - Identification of Ly2 members as antimicrobial peptides from zebrafish Danio rerio.
T2  - Bioscience reports
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes caused by overuse of antibiotics leads to urgent demands for novel antibiotics exploration. Our recent data showed that Ly2.1-3 (a novel lymphocyte antigen 6 (Ly6) gene cluster) were proteins with cationic nature and rich in cysteine content, that are characteristic of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their expression were all significantly up-regulated after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These strongly suggested that Ly2.1-3 are potential AMPs, but firm evidence are lacking. Here, we clearly showed that the recombinant proteins of Ly2.1-3 were capable of killing Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli, while they had little bactericidal activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis We also showed that recombinant proteins Ly2.1-3 (rLy2.1-3) were able to bind to the Gram-negative bacteria A. hydrophila, E. coli and the microbial signature molecule LPS, but not to the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and B. subtilis as well as the microbial signature molecule LTA. Moreover, the Scatchard analysis revealed that rLy2.1-3 could specifically bind to LPS. Finally, we found that Ly2.1-3 were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. All these together indicate that Ly2.1-3 can function as AMPs.

TI  - Analysis of trace malachite green, crystal violet, and their metabolites in zebrafish by surface-coated probe nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
T2  - Talanta
AB  - Malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV) are the typical triphenylmethane dyes, which are recalcitrant molecules exerting mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on living organisms. Characterization of the residues of MG, CV, and their metabolites in biological organisms is of importance, especially for in vivo and in situ characterization. In this study, a method for determination of trace MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites in zebrafish by surface-coated probe nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SCP-nanoESI-MS) was developed. A microscale solid-phase microextraction (SPME) probe was developed and used for extraction and enrichment of trace MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites in zebrafish after exposure. After that, the loaded SPME probe was directly employed for nanoESI-MS analysis under ambient and open-air conditions. Under the optimum conditions, the method demonstrated good linearity, with correlation coefficient values (r(2)) no less than 0.9925. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.014-0.023 ng mL(-1) and 0.046-0.077 ng mL(-1), respectively. By using the proposed method, the bioaccumulation of MG and CV in zebrafish was investigated, and the distribution of MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites in different organs of zebrafish was studied. MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites were all found in zebrafish tissues including brain, muscle, heart, and kidney after exposure, with highest concentration in intestine followed in ovary.

TI  - Glucosamine regulates hepatic lipid accumulation by sensing glucose levels or feeding states of normal and excess.
T2  - Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular and cell biology of lipids
AB  - Dose-dependent lipid accumulation was induced by glucose in HepG2 cells. GlcN also exerted a promotory effect on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions (NG, 5 mM) and liver of normal fed zebrafish larvae. High glucose (HG, 25 mM)-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by l-glutamine-d-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitors. ER stress inhibitors did not suppress HG or GlcN-mediated lipid accumulation. HG and GlcN stimulated protein expression, DNA binding and O-GlcNAcylation of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). Furthermore, both HG and GlcN increased nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) levels in HepG2 cells. In contrast to its stimulatory effect under NG, GlcN suppressed lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under HG conditions. Similarly, GlcN suppressed lipid accumulation in livers of overfed zebrafish. In addition, GlcN activity on DNA binding and O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP was stimulatory under NG and inhibitory under HG conditions. Moreover, GlcN enhanced ChREBP, SREBP-1c, ACC, FAS, L-PK and SCD-1 mRNA expression under NG but inhibited HG-induced upregulation in HepG2 cells. The O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor, alloxan, reduced lipid accumulation by HG or GlcN while the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, PUGNAc, enhanced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and liver of zebrafish larvae. GlcN-induced lipid accumulation was inhibited by the AMPK activator, AICAR. Phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) was suppressed by GlcN under NG while increased by GlcN under HG. PUGNAc downregulated p-AMPK while alloxan restored GlcN- or HG-induced p-AMPK inhibition. Our results collectively suggest that GlcN regulates lipogenesis by sensing the glucose or energy states of normal and excess fuel through AMPK modulation.

TI  - HPLC-Based Activity Profiling for GABAA Receptor Modulators in Searsia pyroides Using a Larval Zebrafish Locomotor Assay.
T2  - Planta medica
AB  - A dichloromethane extract from leaves of Searsia pyroides potentiated gamma aminobutyric acid-induced chloride currents by 171.8 ± 54% when tested at 100 µg/mL in Xenopus oocytes transiently expressing gamma aminobutyric acid type A receptors composed of α(1)β(2)γ(2)s subunits. In zebrafish larvae, the extract significantly lowered pentylenetetrazol-provoked locomotion when tested at 4 µg/mL. Active compounds of the extract were tracked with the aid of HPLC-based activity profiling utilizing a previously validated zebrafish larval locomotor activity assay. From two active HPLC fractions, compounds 1 - 3 were isolated. Structurally related compounds 4 - 6 were purified from a later eluting inactive HPLC fraction. With the aid of (1)H and (13)C NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry, compounds 1 - 6 were identified as analogues of anacardic acid. Compounds 1 - 3 led to a concentration-dependent decrease of pentylenetetrazol-provoked locomotion in the zebrafish larvae model, while 4 - 6 were inactive. Compounds 1 - 3 enhanced gamma aminobutyric acid-induced chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, while 4 - 6 only showed marginal enhancements of gamma aminobutyric acid-induced chloride currents. Compounds 2, 3, and 5 have not been reported previously.

TI  - New insights into cardiotoxicity induced by chiral fluoxetine at environmental-level: Enantioselective arrhythmia in developmental zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Fluoxetine is frequently detected in aquatic environment, and chronic FLX exposure exhibits adverse effects on aquatic communities. Its chirality makes the adverse effects more complicated. This study aimed at the enantioselective cardiotoxicity in developmental zebrafish induced by racemic (rac-)/S-/R-fluoxetine. The accumulation profiles demonstrated that biotransformation of fluoxetine to norfluoxetine occurred during rac-fluoxetine exposure, with a higher enrichment of S-norfluoxetine than R-norfluoxetine. Heart malformations including pericardial edema, circulation abnormalities, and thrombosis were observed, and enantioselective changes also occurred. According to H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining, the loose severity of cardiac structure and cardiac fibrosis in rac-norfluoxetine treated group was worse than that in fluoxetine treated groups. Results of toxicity-associated parameters in our homochiral enantiomers' exposure also indicated that the toxicity induced by S-fluoxetine was more severe than R-fluoxetine. Enantioselective arrhythmia in developmental zebrafish after chiral fluoxetine exposure could be caused by myocardial fibrosis, abnormal developmental processes, and the biotransformation of fluoxetine to norfluoxetine could make that worse. Our findings can be used to assess the environmental risk of the two enantiomers of fluoxetine that induce cardiotoxicity in aquatic organisms.

TI  - Tolerance and efficacy of emamectin benzoate and ivermectin for the treatment of Pseudocapillaria tomentosa in laboratory zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - Tolerance of adult zebrafish and efficacy of emamectin benzoate and ivermectin in eliminating Pseudocapillaria tomentosa infection were evaluated. In the tolerance study, behavioral changes, fecundity, histopathology, and mortality were evaluated for in-feed administration of emamectin (0.05, 0.10, and 0.25 mg/kg) and ivermectin (0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg). All doses of emamectin were well tolerated. Ivermectin 0.05 mg/kg administration resulted in mild behavioral changes and a transient decrease in fecundity. Ivermectin 0.10 mg/kg administration resulted in severe behavioral changes and some mortality. In the efficacy study, emamectin (0.05 and 0.25 mg/kg) and ivermectin (0.05 mg/kg) were evaluated for their efficacy in eliminating P. tomentosa infection. Emamectin reduced parasite burden in infected zebrafish, and ivermectin eliminated intestinal nematode infections. Despite a small margin of safety, ivermectin 0.05 mg/kg was effective at eliminating P. tomentosa infection in adult zebrafish. Higher doses or a longer course of treatment may be needed for complete elimination of P. tomentosa infection using emamectin. In this study, we propose two possible treatments for intestinal nematode infections in zebrafish.

TI  - Colonizing microbiota protect zebrafish larvae against silver nanoparticle toxicity.
T2  - Nanotoxicology
AB  - Metal-based nanoparticles exhibiting antimicrobial activity are of emerging concern to human and environmental health. In addition to their direct adverse effects to plants and animals, indirect effects resulting from disruption of beneficial host-microbiota interactions may contribute to the toxicity of these particles. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the acute toxicity of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles (nAg and nZnO) to zebrafish larvae that were either germ-free or colonized by microbiota. Over two days of exposure, germ-free zebrafish larvae were more sensitive to nAg than microbially colonized larvae, whereas silver ion toxicity did not differ between germ-free and colonized larvae. Using response addition modeling, we confirmed that the protective effect of colonizing microbiota against nAg toxicity was particle-specific. Nearly all mortality among germ-free larvae occurred within the first day of exposure. In contrast, mortality among colonized larvae increased gradually over both exposure days. Concurrent with this gradual increase in mortality was a marked reduction in the numbers of live host-associated microbes, suggesting that bactericidal effects of nAg on protective microbes resulted in increased mortality among colonized larvae over time. No difference in sensitivity between germ-free and colonized larvae was observed for nZnO, which dissolved rapidly in the exposure medium. At sublethal concentrations, these particles moreover did not exert detectable bactericidal effects on larvae-associated microbes. Altogether, our study shows the importance of taking host-microbe interactions into account in assessing toxic effects of nanoparticles to microbially colonized hosts, and provides a method to screen for microbiota interference with nanomaterial toxicity.

TI  - Integrated thyroid endocrine disrupting effect on zebrafish (Danio rario) larvae via simultaneously repressing type II iodothyronine deiodinase and activating thyroid receptor-mediated signaling following waterborne exposure to trace azocyclotin.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - As a widely used organotin acaricide nowadays, azocyclotin (ACT) could induce thyroidal endocrine disruption in fishes and amphibians, but its dominant disrupting mode remains unknown. In this study, zebrafish were firstly exposed to ACT (0.18-0.36 ng/mL) from 2 hpf (hours post fertilization) to 30 dpf (days post fertilization), and a series of developmental toxicological endpoints and thyroid hormones were measured. Result showed that no developmental toxicity to zebrafish was found in 0.18 and 0.24 ng/mL groups except decreased body weight (30 dpf, 0.24 ng/mL). However, exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT led to reductions in heartbeat (48 hpf), hatching rate (72 hpf) and bodyweight (30 dpf). General tendencies of decreases in free T3 but increases in free T4 and reductions in ratio of free T3/T4 were also found, inferring that type II deiodinase (Dio2) was repressed. This inference was confirmed by Western analysis that Dio2 expression reduced by 42.7% after 0.36 ng/mL ACT treatment. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis implied that exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT altered the genome-wide gene expression profiles of zebrafish. Totally 5660 genes (involving 3154 down-regulated and 2596 up-regulated genes) were differentially expressed, and 13 deferentially expressed genes including down-regulated dio2 were significantly enriched in thyroid hormone signaling pathway. Subsequently, an in vitro thyroid receptor-reporter gene assay using GH3 cells was performed to further explore the potential disrupting mechanism. Result showed that luciferase activity slightly increased after exposure to ACT alone or ACT combined with low level T3, but was suppressed when combined with high level T3. It indicted there probably existed a competitive relationship in some extent between ACT and T3 in vivo. Overall, the present study provided preliminary evidences that long-term exposure to trace ACT repressed Dio2 expression, declined T3 and then activated thyroid receptor-mediated signaling, thereby leading to integrated thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Anticancer Agents: Does a Phosphonium Behave Like a Gold(I) Phosphine Complex? Let a "Smart" Probe Answer!
T2  - Journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - Gold phosphine complexes, such as auranofin, have been recognized for decades as antirheumatic agents. Clinical trials are now underway to validate their use in anticancer or anti-HIV treatments. However, their mechanisms of action remain unclear. A challenging question is whether the gold phosphine complex is a prodrug that is administered in an inactive precursor form or rather that the gold atom remains attached to the phosphine ligand during treatment. In this study, we present two novel gold complexes, which we compared to auranofin and to their phosphonium analogue. The chosen ligand is a phosphine-based smart probe, whose strong fluorescence depends on the presence of the gold atom. The in vitro biological action of the gold complexes and the phosphonium derivative were investigated, and a preliminary in vivo study in healthy zebrafish larvae allowed us to evaluate gold complex biodistribution and toxicity. The different analyses carried out showed that these gold complexes were stable and behaved differently from phosphonium and auranofin, both in vitro and in vivo. Two-photon microscopy experiments demonstrated that the cellular targets of these gold complexes are not the same as those of the phosphonium analogue. Moreover, despite similar IC50 values in some cancer cell lines, gold complexes displayed a low toxicity in vivo, in contrast to the phosphonium salt. They are therefore suitable for future in vivo investigations.

TI  - Using zebrafish embryo bioassays combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry screening to assess ecotoxicological water bodies quality status: A case study in Panama rivers.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Several studies show that many water bodies in developing countries are increasingly affected by anthropogenic pressure, such as agricultural activities, domestic and industrial wastewater. However, data is scarce in several of such countries, including Panama. Thus, in this work, the ecotoxicological status of selected rivers in Panama with distinct input sources were evaluated using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo bioassays combined with a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry screening of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), using a library of over 3200 chemicals. A total of 68 CECs, including pharmaceuticals and metabolites, pesticides and several industrial chemicals, could be tentatively identified. Additionally, the zebrafish embryo bioassays showed a significant increase (p \textless 0.05) in embryo mortality/abnormalities when incubated with water samples from two rivers, Matasnillo and Curundú (47.5% and 32%, respectively). Importantly, a positive correlation between ecotoxicological endpoints and some of the detected CECs was observed. The findings demonstrate that both rivers are under strong anthropogenic pressure, and therefore, management actions are urgently needed to decrease their level of contamination. Overall, this study further supports the use of the zebrafish embryo bioassay as a fast, high throughput approach for screening the toxicity of water samples, and highlights the advantages of combining ecotoxicological assays with high-resolution mass spectrometry to an expedite assessment of the ecotoxicological status of water bodies.

TI  - Pharmacological modulation of HDAC1 and HDAC6 in vivo in a zebrafish model: Therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease.
T2  - Pharmacological research
AB  - Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key epigenetic enzymes and emerging drug targets in cancer and neurodegeneration. Pan-HDAC inhibitors provided neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease (PD) models, however, the HDAC isoforms with highest neuroprotective potential remain unknown. Zebrafish larvae (powerful pharmacological testing tools bridging cellular and in vivo studies) have thus far been used in PD modelling with limited phenotypic characterization. Here we characterize the behavioural and metabolic phenotypes of a zebrafish PD model induced with MPP(+), assess the feasibility of targeting zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and test the in vivo effects of their selective inhibitors MS-275 and tubastatin A, respectively. MPP(+) induced a concentration-dependent decrease in metabolic activity and sensorimotor reflexes, and induced locomotor impairments rescuable by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. Zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms show high sequence identity with mammalian homologues at the deacetylase active sites, and pharmacological inhibition increased acetylation of their respective histone and tubulin targets. MS-275 and tubastatin rescued the MPP(+)-induced decrease in diencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence and in whole-larvae metabolic activity, without modifying mitochondrial complex activity or biogenesis. MS-275 or tubastatin alone modulated spontaneous locomotion. When combined with MPP(+), however, neither MS-275 nor tubastatin rescued locomotor impairments, although tubastatin did ameliorate the head-reflex impairment. This study demonstrates the feasibility of pharmacologically targeting the zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and indicates that their inhibition can rescue cellular metabolism in a PD model. Absence of improvement in locomotion, however, suggests that monotherapy with either HDAC1 or HDAC6 inhibitors is unlikely to provide strong benefits in PD. This study highlights parameters dependent on the integrity of zebrafish neuronal circuits as a valuable complement to cell-based studies. Also, the demonstrated feasibility of pharmacologically targeting HDAC1 and HDAC6 in this organism paves the way for future studies investigating HDAC inhibitors in other diseases modelled in zebrafish.

TI  - Fabrication of nano-mosquitocides using chitosan from crab shells: Impact on non-target organisms in the aquatic environment.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Mosquitoes are arthropods of huge medical and veterinary relevance, since they vector pathogens and parasites of public health importance, including malaria, dengue and Zika virus. Currently, nanotechnology is considered a potential eco-friendly approach in mosquito control research. We proposed a novel method of biofabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using chitosan (Ch) from crab shells. Ch-AgNP nanocomposite was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, EDX and XRD. Ch-AgNP were tested against larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi obtaining LC50 ranging from 3.18 ppm (I) to 6.54 ppm (pupae). The antibacterial properties of Ch-AgNP were proved against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi, while no growth inhibition was reported in assays conducted on Proteus vulgaris. Concerning non-target effects, in standard laboratory considtions the predation efficiency of Danio rerio zebrafishes was 68.8% and 61.6% against I and II instar larvae of A. stephensi, respectively. In a Ch-AgNP-contaminated environment, fish predation was boosted to 89.5% and 77.3%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and LPO from hepatopancreas of fresh water crabs Paratelphusa hydrodromous exposed for 16 days to a Ch-AgNP-contaminated aquatic environment were conducted. Notably, deleterious effects of Ch-AgNP contaminating aquatic enviroment on the non-target crab P. hydrodromous were observed, particularly when doses higher than 8-10ppm are tested. Overall, this research highlights the potential of Ch-AGNP for the development of newer control tools against young instar populations of malaria mosquitoes, also highlighting some risks concerned the employ of nanoparticles in aquatic environments.

TI  - Reduction of mitoferrin results in abnormal development and extended lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.
T2  - PloS one
AB  - Iron is essential for organisms. It is mainly utilized in mitochondria for biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, hemes and other cofactors. Mitoferrin 1 and mitoferrin 2, two homologues proteins belonging to the mitochondrial solute carrier family, are required for iron delivery into mitochondria. Mitoferrin 1 is highly expressed in developing erythrocytes which consume a large amount of iron during hemoglobinization. Mitoferrin 2 is ubiquitously expressed, whose functions are less known. Zebrafish with mitoferrin 1 mutation show profound hypochromic anaemia and erythroid maturation arrests, and yeast with defects in MRS3/4, the counterparts of mitoferrin 1/2, has low mitochondrial iron levels and grows poorly by iron depletion. Mitoferrin 1 expression is up-regulated in yeast and mouse models of Fiedreich's ataxia disease and in human cell culture models of Parkinson disease, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases with mitochondrial iron accumulation. In this study we found that reduced mitoferrin levels in C. elegans by RNAi treatment causes pleiotropic phenotypes such as small body size, reduced fecundity, slow movement and increased sensitivity to paraquat. Despite these abnormities, lifespan was increased by 50% to 80% in N2 wild type strain, and in further studies using the RNAi sensitive strain eri-1, more than doubled lifespan was observed. The pathways or mechanisms responsible for the lifespan extension and other phenotypes of mitoferrin RNAi worms are worth further study, which may contribute to our understanding of aging mechanisms and the pathogenesis of iron disorder related diseases.

TI  - Identification of a series of hair-cell MET channel blockers that protect against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.
T2  - JCI insight
AB  - To identify small molecules that shield mammalian sensory hair cells from the ototoxic side effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics, 10,240 compounds were initially screened in zebrafish larvae, selecting for those that protected lateral-line hair cells against neomycin and gentamicin. When the 64 hits from this screen were retested in mouse cochlear cultures, 8 protected outer hair cells (OHCs) from gentamicin in vitro without causing hair-bundle damage. These 8 hits shared structural features and blocked, to varying degrees, the OHC's mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel, a route of aminoglycoside entry into hair cells. Further characterization of one of the strongest MET channel blockers, UoS-7692, revealed it additionally protected against kanamycin and tobramycin and did not abrogate the bactericidal activity of gentamicin. UoS-7692 behaved, like the aminoglycosides, as a permeant blocker of the MET channel; significantly reduced gentamicin-Texas red loading into OHCs; and preserved lateral-line function in neomycin-treated zebrafish. Transtympanic injection of UoS-7692 protected mouse OHCs from furosemide/kanamycin exposure in vivo and partially preserved hearing. The results confirmed the hair-cell MET channel as a viable target for the identification of compounds that protect the cochlea from aminoglycosides and provide a series of hit compounds that will inform the design of future otoprotectants.

TI  - Effect of PCB Bioavailability Changes in Sediments on Bioaccumulation in Fish.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - In situ sediment amendment with sorbents such as activated carbon (AC) can effectively reduce the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). However, there is limited experimental or modeling assessment of how bioavailability changes in sediments impact bioaccumulation in fish - the primary risk driver for exposure to humans and top predators in the aquatic ecosystem. In the present study we performed laboratory aquarium experiments and modeling to explore how PCB sorption in sediments impacted exposure pathways and bioaccumulation in fish. Results showed that freely dissolved PCBs in porewater and overlying water measured by passive sampling were reduced by more than 95% upon amendment with 4.5% fine granular AC. The amendment also reduced the PCB uptake in fish by 87% after 90 days of exposure. Measured freely dissolved concentrations were incorporated in equilibrium and kinetic models for predicting uptake by fish. Predicted uptake using the kinetic model was generally within a factor of 2 for total PCBs measured in fish. The kinetic model output was most sensitive to overlying water PCBs, lipid fraction, and dissolved oxygen concentration (regulating gill ventilation). Our results indicate that by incorporating changes in freely dissolved PCB concentrations in bioaccumulation models it is possible to predict effectiveness of sediment remediation in reducing PCB uptake in fish.

TI  - Effects of low concentrations of triphenyltin on neurobehavior and the thyroid endocrine system in zebrafish.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - In the present study, to evaluate neurobehavioral toxicity and the thyroid-disrupting effects of environmental levels of triphenyltin (TPT), the zebrafish larvae were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 ng/l TPT. In the neurobehavioral assay, increased levels of dopamine and serotonin, decreased content of nitric oxide, inhibited activities of acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase were observed in the whole body of zebrafish larvae after TPT treatment, as well as the serious abnormal non-reproductive behavior. Moreover, the whole-body the T4 levels were markedly decreased significantly, whereas T3 levels were not significantly changed under TPT stress. In addition, TPT exposure significantly changed the expression levels of genes related to thyroid system, including corticotropin-releasing hormone gene crh, thyroid-stimulating hormone gene tshβ, thyroglobulin gene tg, sodium/iodide symporter gene nis, thyroid hormone nuclear receptor trα, isoform trβ, types I deiodinase gene dio1and types II deiodinase gene dio2. The regulated responsiveness of thyroid hormone and related genes expression levels suggested that TPT could induce the thyroid disrupting effects in zebrafish larvae. Therefore, our results provide new aspects of TPT as an endocrine disrupting chemical.

TI  - Interaction between the zebrafish (Danio rerio) organic cation transporter 1 (Oct1) and endo- and xenobiotics.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Organic cation transporters (OCTs) serve as uptake transporters of numerous endo- and xenobiotics. They have been in the focus of medical toxicological research for more than a decade due to their key role in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion due to their expression on basolateral membranes of various barrier tissues. OCTs belong to the SLC22A family within the SLC (Solute carrier) protein superfamily, with three co-orthologs identified in humans (OCT1, 2 and 3), and two Oct orthologs in zebrafish (Oct1 and Oct2). The structural and functional properties of zebrafish Octs, along with their toxicological relevance, have still not been explored. In this study, we performed a functional characterization of zebrafish Oct1 using transient and stable heterologous expression systems and model fluorescent substrates as the basis for interaction studies with a wide range of endo- and xenobiotics. We also conducted a basic topology analysis and homology modeling to determine the structure and membrane localization of Oct1. Finally, we performed an MTT assay to evaluate the toxic effects of the seven interactors identified - oxaliplatin, cisplatin, berberine, MPP(+), prazosin, paraquat and mitoxantrone - in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) stably expressing zebrafish Oct1 (HEK293T-drOct1 cells). Our results show that the zebrafish Oct1 structure consists of 12 transmembrane alpha helices, which form the active region with more than one active site. Five new fluorescent substrates of Oct1 were identified: ASP+ (K(m)=26μM), rhodamine 123 (K(m)=103.7nM), berberine (K(m)=3.96μM), DAPI (K(m)=780nM), and ethidium bromide (K(m)=97nM). Interaction studies revealed numerous interactors that inhibited the Oct1-dependent uptake of fluorescent substrates. The identified interactors ranged from physiological compounds (mainly steroid hormones) to different classes of xenobiotics, with IC(50) values in nanomolar (e.g., pyrimethamine and prazosin) to millimolar range (e.g., cimetidine). Cytotoxicity experiments with HEK293T-drOct1 cells enabled us to identify berberine, oxaliplatin and MPP+ as substrates of Oct1. The data presented in this study provide the first insights into the functional properties of zebrafish Oct1 and offer an important basis for more detailed molecular and ecotoxicological characterizations of this transporter.

TI  - Unraveling the anti-virulence potential and antifungal efficacy of 5-aminotetrazoles using the zebrafish model of disseminated candidiasis.
T2  - European journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - Candida albicans remains the main causal agent of candidiasis, the most common fungal infection with disturbingly high mortality rates worldwide. The limited diversity and efficacy of clinical antifungal drugs, exacerbated by emerging drug resistance, have resulted in the failure of current antifungal therapies. This imposes an urgent demand for the development of innovative strategies for effective eradication of candidal infections. While the existing clinical drugs display fungicidal or fungistatic activity, the strategy specifically targeting C. albicans filamentation, as the most important virulence trait, represents an attractive approach for overcoming the drawbacks related to clinical antifungals. The results acquired in this study revealed the significant potential of 5-aminotetrazoles as a new class of effective and safe anti-virulence agents. Moreover, these novel agents were active when applied both alone and in combination with clinically approved polyenes. Complete prevention of C. albicans morphogenetic yeast-to-hyphae transition was achieved at doses as low as 1.3 μM under conditions mimicking various filamentation-responsive stimuli in the human body, while no cardio- or hepatotoxicity was observed at doses as high as 200 μM. The treatment of C. albicans-infected zebrafish embryos with nystatin alone had low efficacy, while the combination of nystatin and selected 5-aminotetrazoles prevented fungal filamentation, successfully eliminating the infection and rescuing the infected embryos from lethal disseminated candidiasis. In addition, the most potent anti-virulence 5-aminotetrazole prevented C. albicans in developing the resistance to nystatin when applied in combination, keeping the fungus sensitive to the antifungal drug.

TI  - Mesoporous Mn-doped hydroxyapatite nanorods obtained via pyridinium chloride enabled microwave-assisted synthesis by utilizing Donax variabilis seashells for implant applications.
T2  - Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications
AB  - Manganese-doped mesoporous hydroxyapatite (MnHAp) nanorods, a bio-apatite were synthesized via pyridinium chloride mediated microwave approach using bio-waste Donax variabilis seashells to treat orthopedic infections. This is the first report on using pyridinium chloride mediated mesoporous MnHAp nanorods synthesis. Pure and Mn doped HAp samples were examined using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies to confirm the prepared HAp nanorods. Furthermore, the fabrication of manganese-doped HAp was successful with the formation of a hexagonal crystal lattice without disturbing the HAp phase. It is because, at the time of synthesis, PO(4)(3-) ions form an electrostatic interaction with the Mn ions. Furthermore, Mn-doped HAp samples showed a reduction in their sizes of 15, 10-15, 5-10 nm width, and 80-100, 10-15, 20-30 nm length with varied pore diameters and surface area. The pure HAp, MnHAp-1, MnHAp-2, and MnHAp-3 nanorods disclose the surface area of 39.4, 18.0, 49.2, and 80.4 m(2) g(-1), with a pore volume of 0.0102, 0.0047, 0.0143, and 0.0447 cm(3) g(-1), the corresponding pore diameter was estimated to be 6, 7, 6, and 4 nm, respectively. Moreover, antibacterial activity reveals effective bactericidal action against infections causing pathogens whereas cytotoxicity examination (MTT assay), and zebrafish results reveal their non-toxic behavior. Therefore, it is evident from the study, that rapid fabrication of mesoporous and diverse structured MnHAp nanorods could be convenient with pyridinium chloride enabled microwave-assisted method as a bactericidal biomaterial for implant applications.

TI  - Effective naked plasmid DNA delivery into stem cells by microextrusion-based transient-transfection system for in situ cardiac repair.
T2  - Cytotherapy
AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Combining the use of transfection reagents and physical methods can markedly improve the efficiency of gene delivery; however, such methods often cause cell damage. Additionally, naked plasmids without any vector or physical stimulation are difficult to deliver into stem cells. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and rapid method to simultaneously facilitate efficient in situ naked gene delivery and form a bioactive hydrogel scaffold. METHODS: Transfecting naked GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) plasmids into human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) by co-extruding naked plasmids and hUC-MSCs with a biomimetic and negatively charged water-based biodegradable thermo-responsive polyurethane (PU) hydrogel through a microextrusion-based transient-transfection system can upregulate the other cardiac marker genes. RESULTS: The PU hydrogels with optimized physicochemical properties (such as hard-soft segment composition, size, hardness and thermal gelation) induced GATA4-transfected hUC-MSCs to express the cardiac marker proteins and then differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells in 15 days. We further demonstrated that GATA4-transfected hUC-MSCs in PU hydrogel were capable of in situ revival of heart function in zebrafish in 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hUC-MSCs and naked plasmids encapsulated in PU hydrogels might represent a new strategy for in situ tissue therapy using the microextrusion-based transient-transfection system described here. This transfection system is simple, effective and safer than conventional technologies.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of low concentrations of bisphenol A and S exposure in zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The vulnerability to environmental insults is heightened at early stages of development. However, the neurotoxic potential of bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) at developmental windows remains unclear. To investigate the mechanisms mediating the developmental neurotoxicity, zebrafish embryos were treated with 0.01, 0.03, 0.01, 0.3, 1 μM BPA/BPS. Also, we used Tg(HuC:GFP) zebrafish to investigate whether BPA/BPS could induce neuron development. The reduction in body length, and increased heart rate were significant in 0.3 and 1 μM BPA/BPS groups. The green fluorescence protein (GFP) intensity increased at 72 hpf and 120 hpf in Tg(HuC:GFP) larvae which was consistent with the increased mRNA expression of elval3 following BPS treatments, an indication of the plausible effect of BPS on embryonic neuron development. Additionally, BPA/BPS treatments elicited hyperactivity and reduced static time in zebrafish larvae, suggesting behavioral alterations. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed that BPA and BPS could interfere with the normal expression of development-related genes vegfa, wnt8a, and mstn1 at the developmental stages. The expression of neurodevelopment-related genes (ngn1, elavl3, gfap, α1-tubulin, mbp, and gap43) were significantly upregulated in BPA and BPS treatments, except for the remarkable downregulation of mbp and gfap elicited by BPA at 48 (0.03 μM) and 120 hpf (0.3 μM) respectively; ngn1 at 48 hpf for 0.1 μM BPS. Overall, our results highlighted that embryonic exposure to low concentrations of BPA/BPS could be deleterious to the central nervous system development and elicit behavioral abnormalities in zebrafish at developmental stages.

TI  - Chronic Toxic Effects of Flutolanil on the Liver of Zebrafish ( Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemical research in toxicology
AB  - Flutolanil is a broad-spectrum amide fungicide that is widely used to prevent fungal pathogens in agriculture. However, its usage may have a potential environmental impact on organisms. So far, few literatures have investigated the chronic toxicity of flutolanil at concentrations relevant to environmental conditions in the nontarget aquatic organisms. This study was aimed at evaluating whether the long-term exposure of flutolanil affects oxidative stress, immune response, and apoptosis in the liver of zebrafish ( Danio rerio). The results showed that the activity of catalase (CAT) was significantly decreased in the liver in all flutolanil-treated groups. Interestingly, the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were remarkably increased following the flutolanil exposure. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage was increased with a concentration-dependent manner. The transcription level of genes involved in apoptosis and the immune system were significantly altered following flutolanil chronic exposure in zebrafish liver. Furthermore, the caspase-3 enzyme activity was significantly increased. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the resulting effects on oxidative stress, immune toxicity, and apoptosis may be responsible for the pathological alterations in zebrafish liver after flutolanil exposure at concentrations relevant to environmental conditions, advancing the knowledge of pesticide environmental risk assessment.

TI  - Reduced neuronal proliferation by proconvulsant drugs in the developing zebrafish brain.
T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - Seizures have been reported to modify neural development in the immature brain. In this study, we attempted to determine whether pentylenetetrazol (a GABAergic receptor antagonist, PTZ)-induced seizures influence cell proliferation in zebrafish larvae (5 and 15 days of post-fertilization), using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing cells. In the brains of 5 dpf larvae, PTZ treatment significantly reduced the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the telencephalic area (pallium and subpallium), diencephalic area (thalamus and preoptic area), medial tectal proliferation zone, and medial cerebellar proliferation zone to 52.4%, 62.9%, 47.2%, and 54.0% of the controls, respectively. In contrast, we noted no reductions in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the brains of the 15 dpf larvae. The double-label of BrdU and Hu, a neuronal marker, demonstrated that the majority of newborn cells showed the neuronal phenotype. Similarly, kainic acid (200 microM), a glutamatergic receptor agonist, significantly reduced the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the telencephalic area, diencephalic area, and medial tectal proliferation zone to 51.4%, 61.9%, and 40.4% of the controls, respectively. Physostigmine (500 microM), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, also reduced the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the telencephalic area, diencephalic area, medial tectal proliferation zone, and medial cerebellar proliferation zone to 52.8%, 35.9%, 30.5%, and 39.8% of the controls, respectively. All of these drugs resulted in electrographic seizures in the larval brain when perfused directly through artificial cerebrospinal fluid. These results indicated that seizures result in a massive reduction in cell proliferation in wide-ranging areas of the developing brain.

TI  - The EU-ToxRisk method documentation, data processing and chemical testing pipeline for the regulatory use of new approach methods.
T2  - Archives of toxicology
AB  - Hazard assessment, based on new approach methods (NAM), requires the use of batteries of assays, where individual tests may be contributed by different laboratories. A unified strategy for such collaborative testing is presented. It details all procedures required to allow test information to be usable for integrated hazard assessment, strategic project decisions and/or for regulatory purposes. The EU-ToxRisk project developed a strategy to provide regulatorily valid data, and exemplified this using a panel of \textgreater 20 assays (with \textgreater 50 individual endpoints), each exposed to 19 well-known test compounds (e.g. rotenone, colchicine, mercury, paracetamol, rifampicine, paraquat, taxol). Examples of strategy implementation are provided for all aspects required to ensure data validity: (i) documentation of test methods in a publicly accessible database; (ii) deposition of standard operating procedures (SOP) at the European Union DB-ALM repository; (iii) test readiness scoring accoding to defined criteria; (iv) disclosure of the pipeline for data processing; (v) link of uncertainty measures and metadata to the data; (vi) definition of test chemicals, their handling and their behavior in test media; (vii) specification of the test purpose and overall evaluation plans. Moreover, data generation was exemplified by providing results from 25 reporter assays. A complete evaluation of the entire test battery will be described elsewhere. A major learning from the retrospective analysis of this large testing project was the need for thorough definitions of the above strategy aspects, ideally in form of a study pre-registration, to allow adequate interpretation of the data and to ensure overall scientific/toxicological validity.

TI  - Early Life Exposure to Low Levels of AHR Agonist PCB126 (3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl) Reprograms Gene Expression in Adult Brain.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Early life exposure to environmental chemicals can have long-term consequences that are not always apparent until later in life. We recently demonstrated that developmental exposure of zebrafish to low, nonembryotoxic levels of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) did not affect larval behavior, but caused changes in adult behavior. The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying molecular basis for adult behavioral phenotypes resulting from early life exposure to PCB126. We exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 during early development and measured transcriptional profiles in whole embryos, larvae and adult male brains using RNA-sequencing. Early life exposure to 0.3 nM PCB126 induced cyp1a transcript levels in 2-dpf embryos, but not in 5-dpf larvae, suggesting transient activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor with this treatment. No significant induction of cyp1a was observed in the brains of adults exposed as embryos to PCB126. However, a total of 2209 and 1628 genes were differentially expressed in 0.3 and 1.2 nM PCB126-exposed groups, respectively. KEGG pathway analyses of upregulated genes in the brain suggest enrichment of calcium signaling, MAPK and notch signaling, and lysine degradation pathways. Calcium is an important signaling molecule in the brain and altered calcium homeostasis could affect neurobehavior. The downregulated genes in the brain were enriched with oxidative phosphorylation and various metabolic pathways, suggesting that the metabolic capacity of the brain is impaired. Overall, our results suggest that PCB exposure during sensitive periods of early development alters normal development of the brain by reprogramming gene expression patterns, which may result in alterations in adult behavior.

TI  - Natural component plumbagin as a potential antibacterial agent against Streptococcus agalactiae infection.
T2  - Journal of fish diseases
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), can infect humans, terrestrial animals and fish. The emergence of bacterial resistance of S. agalactiae to antibiotics leads to an urgent need of exploration of new antimicrobial agents. In the study, the antibacterial activity of natural component plumbagin (PLB) against S. agalactiae was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PLB against S. agalactiae was 8 mg/L. The growth curve assay revealed that PLB could inhibit the growth of S. agalactiae. In addition, the time-killing curve showed that S. agalactiae was killed almost completely by 2-fold MIC of PLB within 12 h. Transmission electron microscopy results showed obvious severe morphological destruction and abnormal cells of S. agalactiae after treated with PLB. The pathogenicity of S. agalactiae to zebrafish was significantly decreased after preincubation with PLB for 2 h in vitro, further indicating the bactericidal activity of PLB. Interestingly, PLB could kill S. agalactiae without inducing resistance development. Furthermore, pretreatment and post-treatment assays suggested that PLB also exhibited the antibacterial activity against S. agalactiae infection in vivo by effectively reducing the bacterial load and improving the survival rate of S. agalactiae-infected zebrafish. In summary, PLB had potent antibacterial activity against S. agalactiae in vitro and in vivo, and it could be an excellent antimicrobial candidate to prevent and control S. agalactiae infection.

TI  - Subchronic effects of plant alkaloids on anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish.
T2  - Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior
AB  - Zebrafish provide a valuable emerging complementary model for neurobehavioral research. They offer a powerful way to screen for the potential therapeutic effects of neuroactive drugs. A variety of behavioral tests for zebrafish have been developed and validated for assessing neurobehavioral function. The novel tank diving test is a straightforward, reproducible way of measuring anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish. When introduced into a novel tank, zebrafish normally dive to the bottom of the tank and then gradually explore the higher levels of the water column as time progresses. Buspirone is an effective anxiolytic drug in humans, which has been found, with acute administration, to reduce this anxiety-like response in zebrafish. The current study used the zebrafish model to evaluate the potential anxiolytic effects of alkaloids, commonly found in Solanaceae plants, with known neuropharmacology relevant to mood regulation. In line with previous findings, acute treatment with anxiolytic positive controls buspirone and the plant alkaloid nicotine reduced the anxiety-like diving response in the zebrafish novel tank diving test. Further, both buspirone and nicotine continued to produce anxiolytic-like effects in zebrafish after 5 days of exposure. In the same treatment paradigm, the effects of five other alkaloids-cotinine, anatabine, anabasine, harmane, and norharmane-were investigated. Cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, also caused anxiolytic-like effects, albeit at a dose higher than the effective dose of nicotine. Nicotine's anxiolytic-like effect was not shared by the other nicotinic alkaloids, anabasine and anatabine, or by the naturally present monoamine oxidase inhibitors harmane and norharmane. We conclude that nicotine uniquely induces anxiolytic-like effects after acute and subchronic treatment in zebrafish. The zebrafish model with the novel tank diving test could be a useful complement to rodent models for screening candidate compounds for anxiolytic effects in nonclinical studies.

TI  - Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) volatizes and cross-contaminates wells in a common 96-well plate format used in zebrafish larvae toxicology studies.
T2  - Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods
AB  - Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) is an organophosphate (OP) that is commonly used as a surrogate of OP nerve agents to study the neurotoxic effects of acute OP intoxication. In preliminary studies, we discovered abnormally high incidence of deaths in DMSO control zebrafish larvae housed in the same 96-well plate as DFP-exposed larvae and hypothesized that DFP volatilizes and cross-contaminates wells when using static waterborne exposures. Survivability and acetylcholinesterase activity assays were indicative of the presence of DFP in the tissues of zebrafish ostensibly exposed to DMSO only. These findings are consistent with DFP cross-contamination, which raises concerns for the experimental design of studies evaluating the toxicity of volatile and semi-volatile substances in zebrafish using medium-to-high throughput approaches.

TI  - Differential immune responses of immunoglobulin Z subclass members in antibacterial immunity in a zebrafish model.
T2  - Immunology
AB  - Immunoglobulin Z (IgZ) or its equivalent immunoglobulin T (IgT) is a newly identified immunoglobulin (Ig) class from teleost fish. This Ig class is characterized by its involvement in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) for mucosal defence against pathogen infection. Recently, several subclass members of IgZ/IgT, such as IgZ, IgZ2, Igτ1, Igτ2 and Igτ3, have been further identified from zebrafish, common carp and rainbow trout. However, the functional diversity and correlation among these subclasses remain uncertain. Here, we explored the differential immune reactions of the IgZ and IgZ2 subclasses in antibacterial immunity in a zebrafish model. IgZ was extensively distributed in the peripheral serum and skin/gill MALTs and showed a rapid induction upon bacterial infection. IgZ2 was specialized in skin/gill MALTs and showed a strong induction following IgZ production. Correspondingly, the IgZ(+) B cells had a wider distribution in the systemic primary/secondary lymphoid tissues and MALTs than the IgZ2(+) B cells, which were predominant in MALTs. IgZ and IgZ2 exhibited a complementary effect in antibacterial immunity by possessing differential abilities. That is, IgZ is preferentially involved in bactericidal reaction that is in part C1q-dependent, and IgZ2 participates in neutralization action through bacteria-coating activity. The production of IgZ largely depended on the αβ T/CD4(+) T cells, whereas that of IgZ2 did not, suggesting the different dependencies of IgZ and IgZ2 on systemic immunity. Our findings demonstrate that the functional behaviour and mechanism of the IgZ/IgT family are more diverse than previously recognized and thus improve the current knowledge about this ancient Ig class.

TI  - Aurora kinase B regulates axonal outgrowth and regeneration in the spinal motor neurons of developing zebrafish.
T2  - Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS
AB  - Aurora kinase B (AurkB) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with a well-characterised role in orchestrating cell division and cytokinesis, and is prominently expressed in healthy proliferating and cancerous cells. However, the role of AurkB in differentiated and non-dividing cells has not been extensively explored. Previously, we have described a significant upregulation of AurkB expression in cultured cortical neurons following an experimental axonal transection. This is somewhat surprising, as AurkB expression is generally associated only with dividing cells Frangini et al. (Mol Cell 51:647-661, 2013); Hegarat et al. (J Cell Biol 195:1103-1113, 2011); Lu et al. (J Biol Chem 283:31785-31790, 2008); Trakala et al. (Cell Cycle 12:1030-1041, 2014). Herein, we present the first description of a role for AurkB in terminally differentiated neurons. AurkB was prominently expressed within post-mitotic neurons of the zebrafish brain and spinal cord. The expression of AurkB varied during the development of the zebrafish spinal motor neurons. Utilising pharmacological and genetic manipulation to impair AurkB activity resulted in truncation and aberrant motor axon morphology, while overexpression of AurkB resulted in extended axonal outgrowth. Further pharmacological inhibition of AurkB activity in regenerating axons delayed their recovery following UV laser-mediated injury. Collectively, these results suggest a hitherto unreported role of AurkB in regulating neuronal development and axonal outgrowth.

TI  - The fabrication and assessment of mosquito repellent cream for outdoor protection.
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Mosquito-borne infections like dengue, malaria, chikungunya, etc. are a nuisance and can cause profound discomfort to people. Due to the objectional side effects and toxicity associated with synthetic pyrethroids, N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), N,N-diethyl phenylacetamide (DEPA), and N,N-di ethyl benzamide (DEBA) based mosquito repellent products, we developed an essential oil (EO) based mosquito repellent cream (EO-MRC) using clove, citronella and lemongrass oil. Subsequently, a formulation characterization, bio-efficacy, and safety study of EO-MRC were carried out. Expression of Anti-OBP2A and TRPV1 proteins on mosquito head parts were studied by western blotting. In-silico screening was also conducted for the specific proteins. An FT-IR study confirmed the chemical compatibility of the EOs and excipients used in EO-MRC. The thermal behaviour of the best EOs and their mixture was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). GC-MS examination revealed various chemical components present in EOs. Efficacy of EO-MRC was correlated with 12% N,N-diethyl benzamide (DEBA) based marketed cream (DBMC). Complete protection time (CPT) of EO-MRC was determined as 228 min. Cytotoxicity study on L-132 cell line confirmed the non-toxic nature of EO-MRC upon inhalation. Acute dermal irritation study, acute dermal dose toxicity study, and acute eye irritation study revealed the non-toxic nature of EO-MRC. Non-target toxicity study on Danio rerio confirmed EO-MRC as safer for aquatic non-target animals. A decrease in the concentration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was observed in transfluthrin (TNSF) exposed Wistar rats. While EO-MRC did not alter the AChE concentrations in the exposed animals. Results from western blotting confirmed that Anti-OBP2A and TRPV1 proteins were inhibited in TNSF exposed mosquitoes. Mosquitoes exposed to EO-MRC showed a similar expression pattern for Anti-OBP2A and TRPV1 as the control group. In silico study revealed eight identified compounds of the EOs play significant roles in the overall repellency property of the developed product. The study emphasizes the mosquito repellent activity of EO-MRC, which could be an effective, eco-friendly, and safer alternative to the existing synthetic repellents for personal protection against mosquitoes during field conditions.

TI  - An adverse outcome pathway framework for neural tube and axial defects mediated by modulation of retinoic acid homeostasis.
T2  - Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)
AB  - Developmental toxicity can be caused through a multitude of mechanisms and can therefore not be captured through a single simple mechanistic paradigm. However, it may be possible to define a selected group of overarching mechanisms that might allow detection of the vast majority of developmental toxicants. Against this background, we have explored the usefulness of retinoic acid mediated regulation of neural tube and axial patterning as a general mechanism that, when perturbed, may result in manifestations of developmental toxicity that may cover a large part of malformations known to occur in experimental animals and in man. Through a literature survey, we have identified key genes in the regulation of retinoic acid homeostasis, as well as marker genes of neural tube and axial patterning, that may be used to detect developmental toxicants in in vitro systems. A retinoic acid-neural tube/axial patterning adverse outcome pathway (RA-NTA AOP) framework was designed. The framework was tested against existing data of flusilazole exposure in the rat whole embryo culture, the zebrafish embryotoxicity test, and the embryonic stem cell test. Flusilazole is known to interact with retinoic acid homeostasis, and induced common and unique NTA marker gene changes in the three test systems. Flusilazole-induced changes were similar in directionality to gene expression responses after retinoic acid exposure. It is suggested that the RA-NTA framework may provide a general tool to define mechanistic pathways and biomarkers of developmental toxicity that may be used in alternative in vitro assays for the detection of embryotoxic compounds.

TI  - Unexpected neuronal protection of SU5416 against 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion-induced toxicity via inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase.
T2  - PloS one
AB  - SU5416 was originally designed as a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) for cancer therapy. In this study, we have found for the first time that SU5416 unexpectedly prevented 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-induced neuronal apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons, and decreased 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and impairment of swimming behavior in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner. However, VEGFR-2 kinase inhibitor II, another specific VEGFR-2 inhibitor, failed to reverse neurotoxicity at the concentration exhibiting anti-angiogenic activity, strongly suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of SU5416 is independent from its anti-angiogenic action. SU5416 potently reversed MPP(+)-increased intracellular nitric oxide level with an efficacy similar to 7-nitroindazole, a specific neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor. Western blotting analysis showed that SU5416 reduced the elevation of nNOS protein expression induced by MPP(+). Furthermore, SU5416 directly inhibited the enzyme activity of rat cerebellum nNOS with an IC(50) value of 22.7 µM. In addition, knock-down of nNOS expression using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) abolished the neuroprotective effects of SU5416 against MPP(+)-induced neuronal loss. Our results strongly demonstrate that SU5416 might exert its unexpected neuroprotective effects by concurrently reducing nNOS protein expression and directly inhibiting nNOS enzyme activity. In view of the capability of SU5416 to cross the blood-brain barrier and the safety for human use, our findings further indicate that SU5416 might be a novel drug candidate for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those associated with NO-mediated neurotoxicity.

TI  - Tolerated doses in zebrafish of cytochalasins and jasplakinolide for comparison with tolerated doses in mice in the evaluation of pre-clinical activity of microfilament-directed agents in tumor model systems in vivo.
T2  - In vivo (Athens, Greece)
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemotherapeutic approaches involving microtubule-directed agents such as the vinca alkaloids and taxanes are used extensively and effectively in clinical cancer therapy. There is abundant evidence of critical cytoskeletal differences involving microfilaments between normal and neoplastic cells, and a variety of natural products and semi-synthetic derivatives are available to exploit these differences in vitro. In spite of the availability of such potential anti-neoplastic agents, there has yet to be an effective microfilament-directed agent approved for clinical use. Cytochalasins are mycogenic toxins derived from a variety of fungal sources that have shown promising in vitro efficacy in disrupting microfilaments and producing remarkable cell enlargement and multi-nucleation in cancer cells without producing enlargement and multi-nucleation in normal blood cells. Jasplakinolide is a sponge toxin that stabilizes and rigidifies microfilaments. Insufficient in vivo data has been acquired to determine whether any of the microfilament-directed agents have valuable preferential anticancer activity in pre-clinical tumor model systems. This is partly because the limited availability of these agents precludes their initial use in large-scale mammalian pre-clinical studies. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the tolerated in vivo doses of cytochalasins and jasplakinolide in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a well-studied fish cancer model that is 1.5% the size of mice. We also determined the tolerated levels of a variety of clinically active anti-neoplastic agents in zebrafish for comparison with tolerated murine doses as a means to allow comparison of toxicities in zebrafish expressed as μM concentrations with toxicities in mice expressed in mg/kg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tolerated doses in zebrafish with various cytochalasins or jasplakinolide were determined by adding the solubilized test agent to water in which the fish were maintained for 24 h, then restored to their normal tanks and monitored for a total of 96 h. RESULTS: Cytochalasin D at 0.2 μM gave an approximate LD50 in zebrafish, while cytochalasin B was fully-tolerated at 5 μM, and gave an LD50 of 10 μM. 21,22-dihydrocytochalasin B was fully-tolerated at 10 μM. Cytochalasin C was tolerated fully at 1 μM, ten-fold higher than the level for cytochalasin D that was tolerated. Jasplakinolide at 0.5 μM did not exhibit any apparent acute toxicity or affect fish behavior for four days, but delayed toxicity was evident at days 4 and 6 when the fish died. Further, the addition of 5 μM glutathione (GSH) at the time of treatment substantially decreased the toxicity of 10 μM cytochalasin B, a level of cytochalasin B that not otherwise tolerated in vivo. Such observations were likely due to GSH-mediated alkylation of C-20 in cytochalasin B, thereby reducing the rate of oxidation to the highly toxic congener, cytochalasin A, and reacting with any cytochalazin A formed. The protective effects of GSH are further supported by its ability to react with α, β-unsaturated ketone moieties, as is found in cytochalasin A. GSH at 0.8 uM was able to reduce the toxicity of 0.8 μM cytochalasin D, but it took 20 μM GSH to fully protect against the toxicity of 0.8 μM cytochalasin D. CONCLUSION: Pre-clinical evaluation of rare natural products such as microfilamented-directed agents for efficacy in vivo in tumor-bearing zebrafish is a feasible prospect. Dose-limiting toxicities in zebrafish expressed as μM concentrations in water can be used to estimate in vivo toxicities in mice expressed as mg/kg.

TI  - Identification of modulators of hair cell regeneration in the zebrafish lateral line.
T2  - The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience
AB  - The external location of the zebrafish lateral line makes it a powerful model for studying mechanosensory hair cell regeneration. We have developed a chemical screen to identify FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds that modulate hair cell regeneration in zebrafish. Of the 1680 compounds evaluated, we identified two enhancers and six inhibitors of regeneration. The two enhancers, dexamethasone and prednisolone, are synthetic glucocorticoids that potentiated hair cell numbers during regeneration and also induced hair cell addition in the absence of damage. BrdU analysis confirmed that the extra hair cells arose from mitotic activity. We found that dexamethasone and prednisolone, like other glucocorticoids, suppress zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, indicating that hair cell regeneration occurs by a distinctly different process. Further analyses of the regeneration inhibitors revealed that two of the six, flubendazole and topotecan, significantly suppress hair cell regeneration by preventing proliferation of hair cell precursors. Flubendazole halted support cell division in M-phase, possibly by interfering with normal microtubule activity. Topotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor, killed both hair cells and proliferating hair cell precursors. A third inhibitor, fulvestrant, moderately delayed hair cell regeneration by reducing support cell proliferation. Our observation that hair cells do not regenerate when support cell proliferation is impeded confirms previous observations that cell division is the primary route for hair cell regeneration after neomycin treatment in zebrafish.

T2  - Journal of materials chemistry. B
AB  - IR780 as a commercially available dye with near-infrared emission has been extensively applied in fluorescent probes and bioimaging. In this work, to further intensify the optical behavior, a tetrahydropyridine ring was used to replace the cyclohexene ring at the center of IR780, forming a cyanine dye Cy-NH with near-infrared emission. Photophysical properties demonstrated that Cy-NH exhibits good optical performance. In particular, Cy-NH contains two functional reaction sites (e.g. Cl and NH sites on the tetrahydropyridine ring) and can be used to construct functional cyanine dyes. Investigation on imaging showed that these cyanines can be used as near-infrared fluorescent imaging agents in living cells and in vivo.

TI  - Synthesis and Antibacterial Study of Sulfobetaine/Quaternary Ammonium-Modified Star-Shaped Poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-Based Copolymers with an Inorganic Core.
T2  - Biomacromolecules
AB  - Cationic polymethacrylates are interesting candidates for bacterial disinfectants since they can be made in large-scale by various well-established polymerization techniques such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). However, they are usually toxic or ineffective in serum and various strategies to improve their biocompatibility or nonfouling property have often resulted in compromised bactericidal activity. Also, star-shaped polymers are less explored than linear polymers for application as antibacterial compounds. In this paper, star polymers with poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDMA) as the arms and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) as the core (POSS-g-PDMA) were successfully synthesized by ATRP. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of the synthesized POSS-g-PDMA are in the range of 10-20 μg/mL. POSS-g-PDMA was further modified by various hydrophilization strategies in attempting to reduce hemolysis. With quaternization of POSS-g-PDMA, the antibacterial activities of the obtained quaternary polymers are almost unchanged and the copolymers become relatively nonhemolytic. We also copolymerized sulfobetaine (SB) with POSS-g-PDMA to obtain random and block PDMA-co-PSB arm structures, where the PDMA and poly(sulfobetaine) were the cationic and zwitterionic blocks, respectively. The random cationic-zwitterionic POSS-g-(PDMA-r-PSB) copolymers showed poor antibacterial activity, while the block POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) copolymers retained the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of the pristine POSS-g-PDMA. Further, the block copolymers of POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) showed enhanced antifouling property and serum stability as seen by their nanoparticle size stability in the presence of serum and reduced red blood cell aggregation; the POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) also somewhat retained its MIC in blood unlike the quaternized or random zwitterionic copolymers. The antibacterial kinetics study showed that Escherichia coli can be killed within 30 min by both random and block copolymers of POSS-g-(PDMA-co-PSB). Finally, our POSS star polymers showed low toxicity to zebrafish embryo and could be potentially used in aquaculture antibacterial applications.

TI  - Transcriptional analysis of endocrine disruption using zebrafish and massively parallel sequencing.
T2  - Journal of molecular endocrinology
AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including plasticizers, pesticides, detergents, and pharmaceuticals, affect a variety of hormone-regulated physiological pathways in humans and wildlife. Many EDCs are lipophilic molecules and bind to hydrophobic pockets in steroid receptors, such as the estrogen receptor and androgen receptor, which are important in vertebrate reproduction and development. Indeed, health effects attributed to EDCs include reproductive dysfunction (e.g. reduced fertility, reproductive tract abnormalities, and skewed male:female sex ratios in fish), early puberty, various cancers, and obesity. A major concern is the effects of exposure to low concentrations of endocrine disruptors in utero and post partum, which may increase the incidence of cancer and diabetes in adults. EDCs affect transcription of hundreds and even thousands of genes, which has created the need for new tools to monitor the global effects of EDCs. The emergence of massive parallel sequencing for investigating gene transcription provides a sensitive tool for monitoring the effects of EDCs on humans and other vertebrates, as well as elucidating the mechanism of action of EDCs. Zebrafish conserve many developmental pathways found in humans, which makes zebrafish a valuable model system for studying EDCs, especially on early organ development because their embryos are translucent. In this article, we review recent advances in massive parallel sequencing approaches with a focus on zebrafish. We make the case that zebrafish exposed to EDCs at different stages of development can provide important insights on EDC effects on human health.

TI  - Assessing the effects of an acute exposure to worst-case concentration of Cry proteins on zebrafish using the embryotoxicity test and proteomics analysis.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Cry1C, Cry1F and Cry1Ab are insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) which are expressed in transgenic crops. Given the entry of these proteins into aquatic environments, it is relevant to evaluate their impacts on aquatic organisms. In this work, we sought to evaluate the effects of Cry1C, Cry1F and Cry1Ab on zebrafish embryos and larvae of a predicted worst-case scenario concentration of these proteins (set to 1.1 mg/L). For that, we coupled a traditional toxicity approach (the zebrafish embryotoxicity test and dosage of enzymatic biomarkers) to gel free proteomics analysis. At the concentration tested, these proteins did not cause adverse effects in the zebrafish early life stages, either by verifying phenotypic endpoints of toxicity or alterations in representative enzymatic biomarkers (catalase, glutathione-S-tranferase and lactate-dehydrogenase). At the molecular level, the Cry proteins tested lead to very small changes in the proteome of zebrafish larvae. In a global way, these proteins upregulated the expression of vitellogenins. Besides that, Cry1C e Cry1F deregulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (Hnrnpa0l and Hnrnpaba, respectively), implicated in mRNA processing and gene regulation. Overall, these data lead to the conclusion that Cry1C, Cry1F and Cry1Ab proteins, even at a very high concentration, have limited effects in the early stages of zebrafish life.

TI  - Protective effects of vitamin E against 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) induced toxicity in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - 3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorinated biphenyls 126 (PCB126) is a global environmental contaminant that can induce cellular oxidative stress. We investigated whether vitamin E can protect against toxicity from PCB126 during zebrafish (Danio rerio) development. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 100nM PCB126 and compared with a second group that was co-exposed with 100muM vitamin E until 5 days post fertilization. PCB126 induced pericardial sac edema, yolk sac edema, and growth retardation in zebrafish embyos. In contrast, vitamin E co-exposure group did not show any gross changes. Real-time PCR results showed that vitamin E co-exposure group were restored to control group for the expression levels of heat shock protein 70 Cognate, aryl hydrocarbon receptor type-2, cytochrome P450 1A, and superoxide dismutase-1. These data give insights into the use of vitamin E to reduce PCB126-mediated toxicity and into the use of zebrafish embryos for exploring mechanisms underlying the oxidative potential of AHR agonists.

TI  - IC-4, a new irreversible EGFR inhibitor, exhibits prominent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis activities.
T2  - Cancer letters
AB  - Accumulating evidence suggested that the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have potential to override the acquired resistance to target-based therapies. Herein, we reported IC-4 as a novel irreversible TKI for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). IC-4 potentially suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis and a G2/M cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells, correlating with inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR activation, but independent of DNA damage. In addition, IC-4 exhibited anti-angiogenetic activities both in vitro and in vivo. It suppressed cell viability and proliferation induced by various growth factors in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). IC-4 also inhibited HUVECs migration and tube formation. In transgenic zebrafish embryo model, IC-4 was shown to suppress formation of intersegmental vessel and development of subintestinal vessels. Taken together, these results demonstrated that IC-4 is a new irreversible EGFR-TKI, exhibiting potent anti-breast cancer and anti-angiogenetic effects.

TI  - Phenotypic and biomarker evaluation of zebrafish larvae as an alternative model to predict mammalian hepatotoxicity.
T2  - Journal of applied toxicology : JAT
AB  - Zebrafish phenotypic assays have shown promise to assess human hepatotoxicity, though scoring of liver morphology remains subjective and difficult to standardize. Liver toxicity in zebrafish larvae at 5 days was assessed using gene expression as the biomarker approach, complementary to phenotypic analysis and analytical data on compound uptake. This approach aimed to contribute to improved hepatotoxicity prediction, with the goal of identifying biomarker(s) as a step towards the development of transgenic models for prioritization. Morphological effects of hepatotoxic compounds (acetaminophen, amiodarone, coumarin, methapyrilene and myclobutanil) and saccharin as the negative control were assessed after exposure in zebrafish larvae. The hepatotoxic compounds induced the expected zebrafish liver degeneration or changes in size, whereas saccharin did not have any phenotypic adverse effect. Analytical methods based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were optimized to measure stability of selected compounds in exposure medium and internal concentration in larvae. All compounds were stable, except amiodarone for which precipitation was observed. There was a wide variation between the levels of compound in the zebrafish larvae with a higher uptake of amiodarone, methapyrilene and myclobutanil. Detection of hepatocyte markers (CP, CYP3A65, GC and TF) was accomplished by in situ hybridization of larvae to coumarin and myclobutanil and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Experiments showed decreased expression of all markers. Next, other liver-specific biomarkers (i.e. FABP10a and NR1H4) and apoptosis (i.e. CASP-3 A and TP53) or cytochrome P450-related (CYP2K19) and oxidoreductase activity-related (ZGC163022) genes, were screened. Links between basic mechanisms of liver injury and results of biomarker responses are described. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The anti-cancer agent SU4312 unexpectedly protects against MPP(+) -induced neurotoxicity via selective and direct inhibition of neuronal NOS.
T2  - British journal of pharmacology
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: SU4312, a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), has been designed to treat cancer. Recent studies have suggested that SU4312 can also be useful in treating neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we assessed neuroprotection by SU4312 against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+) )-induced neurotoxicity and further explored the underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: MPP(+) -treated neurons and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated zebrafish were used to study neuroprotection by SU4312. NOS activity was assayed in vitro to examine direct interactions between SU4312 and NOS isoforms. KEY RESULTS: SU4312 unexpectedly prevented MPP(+) -induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and decreased MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, reduced expression of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase and impaired swimming behaviour in zebrafish. In contrast, PTK787/ZK222584, a well-studied VEGFR-2 inhibitor, failed to prevent neurotoxicity, suggesting that the neuroprotective actions of SU4312 were independent of its anti-angiogenic action. Furthermore, SU4312 exhibited non-competitive inhibition of purified neuronal NOS (nNOS) with an IC(50) value of 19.0 μM but showed little or no effects on inducible and endothelial NOS. Molecular docking simulations suggested an interaction between SU4312 and the haem group within the active centre of nNOS. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION: SU4312 exhibited neuroprotection against MPP(+) at least partly via selective and direct inhibition of nNOS. Because SU4312 could reach the brain in rats, our study also offered a support for further development of SU4312 to treat neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those associated with NO-mediated neurotoxicity.

TI  - A High-Content Screen Identifies Drugs That Restrict Tumor Cell Extravasation across the Endothelial Barrier.
T2  - Cancer research
AB  - Metastases largely rely on hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells via the vascular system and significantly limit prognosis of patients with solid tumors. To colonize distant sites, circulating tumor cells must destabilize the endothelial barrier and transmigrate across the vessel wall. Here we performed a high-content screen to identify drugs that block tumor cell extravasation by testing 3,520 compounds on a transendothelial invasion coculture assay. Hits were further characterized and validated using a series of in vitro assays, a zebrafish model enabling three-dimensional (3D) visualization of tumor cell extravasation, and mouse models of lung metastasis. The initial screen advanced 38 compounds as potential hits, of which, four compounds enhanced endothelial barrier stability while concurrently suppressing tumor cell motility. Two compounds niclosamide and forskolin significantly reduced tumor cell extravasation in zebrafish, and niclosamide drastically impaired metastasis in mice. Because niclosamide had not previously been linked with effects on barrier function, single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered mechanistic effects of the drug on both tumor and endothelial cells. Importantly, niclosamide affected homotypic and heterotypic signaling critical to intercellular junctions, cell-matrix interactions, and cytoskeletal regulation. Proteomic analysis indicated that niclosamide-treated mice also showed reduced levels of kininogen, the precursor to the permeability mediator bradykinin. Our findings designate niclosamide as an effective drug that restricts tumor cell extravasation through modulation of signaling pathways, chemokines, and tumor-endothelial cell interactions. SIGNIFICANCE: A high-content screen identified niclosamide as an effective drug that restricts tumor cell extravasation by enhancing endothelial barrier stability through modulation of molecular signaling, chemokines, and tumor-endothelial cell interactions.

TI  - Cadmium exposure increases the risk of juvenile obesity: a human and zebrafish comparative study.
T2  - International journal of obesity (2005)
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human obesity is a complex metabolic disorder disproportionately affecting people of lower socioeconomic strata, and ethnic minorities, especially African Americans and Hispanics. Although genetic predisposition and a positive energy balance are implicated in obesity, these factors alone do not account for the excess prevalence of obesity in lower socioeconomic populations. Therefore, environmental factors, including exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants, are agents widely suspected to have obesogenic activity, and they also are spatially correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Our study investigates the causal relationship between exposure to the heavy metal, cadmium (Cd), and obesity in a cohort of children and in a zebrafish model of adipogenesis. DESIGN: An extensive collection of first trimester maternal blood samples obtained as part of the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) was analyzed for the presence of Cd, and these results were cross analyzed with the weight-gain trajectory of the children through age 5 years. Next, the role of Cd as a potential obesogen was analyzed in an in vivo zebrafish model. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the presence of Cd in maternal blood during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of juvenile obesity in the offspring, independent of other variables, including lead (Pb) and smoking status. Our results are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, in which exposure to Cd at levels approximating those observed in the NEST study is associated with increased adiposity. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify Cd as a potential human obesogen. Moreover, these observations are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved, and that zebrafish may be a valuable model for uncovering pathways leading to Cd-mediated obesity in human populations.

TI  - A novel dual-ratiometric-response fluorescent probe for SO(2)/ClO(-) detection in cells and in vivo and its application in exploring the dichotomous role of SO(2) under the ClO(-) induced oxidative stress.
T2  - Biomaterials
AB  - Intracellular reactive sulfur species and reactive oxygen species play vital roles in immunologic mechanism. As an emerging signal transmitter, SO(2) can be generated as the anti-oxidant, while SO(2) is also a potential oxidative stress-inducer in organism. Aiming to elucidate in-depth the dichotomous role of SO(2) under oxidative stress, we designed a dual-response fluorescent probe that enabled the respective or successive detection of SO(2) and ClO(-). The probe itself emits the red fluorescence (625 nm) which can largely switch to blue (410 nm) and green fluorescence (500 nm) respectively in response to SO(2) and ClO(-), allowing the highly selective and accurate ratiometric quantification for both SO(2) and ClO(-) in cells. Moreover the ultrafast (SO(2): \textless60 s; ClO(-): within sec) and highly sensitive (detection limits: SO(2): 3.5 nM; ClO(-): 12.5 nM) detection were achieved. With the robust applicability, the developed probe was successfully used to quantify SO(2) and endogenous ClO(-) in respectively the HeLa cells and the RAW 264.7 cells, as well as to visualize the dynamic of SO(2)/ClO(-) in zebrafish. The fluorescent imaging studies and flow cytometry analysis confirmed the burst-and-depletion and meanwhile the oxidative-and-antioxidative effects of intracellular SO(2) under the NaClO induced oxidative stress.

TI  - Glutathione transferase pi class 2 (GSTp2) protects against the cardiac deformities caused by exposure to PAHs but not PCB-126 in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are phase II enzymes that detoxify a wide range of toxicants and reactive intermediates. One such class of toxicants is the ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Certain PAHs are known to cause developmental cardiac toxicity in fish. Herein, we explored the role of GST pi class 2 (GSTp2) in PAH- and PCB-induced cardiac toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. We measured expression of GSTp2 in embryos exposed to individual and co-exposures of the PAHs benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and fluoranthene (FL) as well as 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126). GSTp2 mRNA expression was induced by exposure to BkF, BaP, PCB-126, and BaP+FL and BkF+FL co-exposure. A splice junction morpholino was then used to knockdown GSTp2 in developing zebrafish. GSTp2 knockdown exacerbated the toxicity caused by co-exposures to BkF+FL and BaP+FL. However, GSTp2 knockdown did not affect PCB-126 toxicity. These results further suggest that pi class GSTs serve a protective function against the synergistic toxicity caused by PAHs in developing zebrafish.

TI  - Antimetastatic Therapies of the Polysulfide Diallyl Trisulfide against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) via Suppressing MMP2/9 by Blocking NF-κB and ERK/MAPK Signaling Pathways.
T2  - PloS one
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migration and invasion are two crucial steps of tumor metastasis. Blockage of these steps may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfuric compound with most sulfur atoms found in garlic, on migration and invasion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DATS were further investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 cells and HS 578t breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of DATS. DATS obviously suppressed the migration and invasion of two cell lines and changed the morphological. Moreover, DATS inhibited the mRNA/protein/ enzymes activities of MMP2/9 via attenuating the NF-κB pathway. DATS also inhibited ERK/MAPK rather than p38 and JNK. CONCLUSION: DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of TNBC cells, and emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent. The inhibitory effects are associated with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways.

TI  - Cardiovascular Effects of PCB 126 (3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl) in Zebrafish Embryos and Impact of Co-Exposure to Redox Modulating Chemicals.
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - The developing cardiovascular system of zebrafish is a sensitive target for many environmental pollutants, including dioxin-like compounds and pesticides. Some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can compromise the cardiovascular endothelial function by activating oxidative stress-sensitive signaling pathways. Therefore, we exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 or to several redox-modulating chemicals to study their ability to modulate the dysmorphogenesis produced by PCB126. PCB126 produced a concentration-dependent induction of pericardial edema and circulatory failure, and a concentration-dependent reduction of cardiac output and body length at 80 hours post fertilization (hpf). Among several modulators tested, the effects of PCB126 could be both positively and negatively modulated by different compounds; co-treatment with α-tocopherol (vitamin E liposoluble) prevented the adverse effects of PCB126 in pericardial edema, whereas co-treatment with sodium nitroprusside (a vasodilator compound) significantly worsened PCB126 effects. Gene expression analysis showed an up-regulation of cyp1a, hsp70, and gstp1, indicative of PCB126 interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), while the transcription of antioxidant genes (sod1, sod2; cat and gpx1a) was not affected. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of oxidative stress in the developmental toxicity of low concentrations of PCB126 (25 nM). Our results give insights into the use of zebrafish embryos for exploring mechanisms underlying the oxidative potential of environmental pollutants.

TI  - Comprehensive characterization of neurochemicals in three zebrafish chemical models of human acute organophosphorus poisoning using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
T2  - Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry
AB  - There is a growing interest in biological models to investigate the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on the structure and function of the central nervous system (CNS) at different stages of development. Zebrafish, a vertebrate model increasingly used in neurobiology and neurotoxicology, shares the common neurotransmitter systems with mammals, including glutamate, GABA, glycine, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine. In this study, we have evaluated the performance of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the multiresidue determination of neurotransmitters and related metabolites. In a first step, ionization conditions were tested in positive electrospray mode and optimum fragmentation patterns were determined to optimize two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions. Chromatographic conditions were optimized considering the chemical structure and chromatographic behavior of the analyzed compounds. The best performance was obtained with a Synergy Polar-RP column, which allowed the separation of the 38 compounds in 30 min. In addition, the performance of LC-MS/MS was studied in terms of linearity, sensitivity, intra- and inter-day precision, and overall robustness. The developed analytical method was able to quantify 27 of these neurochemicals in zebrafish chemical models for mild (P1), moderate (P2), and severe (P3) acute organophosphorus poisoning (OPP). The results show a general depression of synaptic-related neurochemicals, including the excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, as well as altered phospholipid metabolism, with specific neurochemical profiles associated to the different grades of severity. These results confirmed that the developed analytical method is a new tool for neurotoxicology research using the zebrafish model.

TI  - A novel reaction-based fluorescence probe for rapid imaging of HClO in live cells, animals, and injured liver tissues.
T2  - Talanta
AB  - Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is an important bioactive molecule, playing vital roles in a large number of physiological and pathological processes. Abnormal concentration of HClO in vivo has close contact with many diseases including inflammatory diseases and cancer. For bioimaging HClO, a new colorimetric and turn-on near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe (DDAO-ClO) was designed and synthesized in this work through a specific reaction of HClO with dimethylthiocarbamate. DDAO-ClO proved to show distinct and highly selective colorimetric and NIR fluorescence responses for HClO with fast response time (\textless3 s) and high sensitivity (LOD = 7.3 nM) in vitro. After confirming the excellent in vitro sensing ability, imaging HClO with DDAO-ClO in living HeLa cells, MCF-7 cells, zebrafish, and mice was all successfully demonstrated. And with this probe, it was further discovered that more endogenous HClO was produced in injured mice liver tissues, which demonstrates that DDAO-ClO not only is effective for in vivo detection of HClO but also has a broad application prospect.

TI  - Toxicological interactions of microplastics/nanoplastics and environmental contaminants: Current knowledge and future perspectives.
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - The co-occurrence of microplastics/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) with other environmental contaminants has stimulated a focus shift of its skyrocketed research publications (more than 3000 papers during 2016-2020, Web of Science) from ubiquitous occurrence to interactive toxicity. Here, in this review, we provided the current state of knowledge on toxicological interaction of MPs/NPs with co-contaminants (heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, nanoparticles, organohalogens, plastic additives, and organotins). We discussed the possible interactions (aggregation, adsorption, accumulation, transformation, desorption) that played a role in influencing the toxicity of the mixture. Besides, the type of interactions such as synergistic, antagonistic, potentiating was expounded to get a deeper mechanistic understanding. Despite the wide occurrence and usage, scant studies were available on polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate. Our analysis shows a dearth of research on common occurring heavy metals (mercury, lead, chromium), phthalates, personal care products. Considerations for environmental factors such as the presence of dissolved organic matter, pH, salinity, temperature, and effects of different colors and types of polymer are recommended.

TI  - Avoidance responses by Danio rerio reveal interactive effects of warming, pesticides and their mixtures.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Temperature variations and thermal extremes events caused by climate change can have profound implications for the toxicity of pesticides in aquatic organisms. Using an innovative system (Heterogeneous Multi-Habitat Test System - HeMHAS) that allows the simulation of different scenarios within a spatially heterogeneous landscape, the effects on the habitat selection of Danio rerio fish caused by the pesticides fipronil and 2,4-D were studied as single compounds and in mixture and integrated with air temperature variation (20, 24 and 28 °C). As a result, D. rerio detected and avoided both pesticides at air temperatures of 20 and 24 °C; however, at 28 °C no significant difference was observed in habitat choice by fish. Additionally, when pesticides were mixed in a heterogeneously contaminated landscape, it was observed that D. rerio detected contamination and preferred the clean zone at 20 and 24 °C; however, at 28 °C the potential to escape from the most contaminated areas was impaired. Thus, contamination by both pesticides made the habitat selection behavior of fish at 20 and 24 °C more noticeable. In addition, the association between pesticides and temperature showed negative effects on the response of fish to detect and escape from contaminated environments, suggesting the influence of temperature in altering the ability of the organism to provide an efficient response to stress.

TI  - Oxidative stress, DNA, and membranes targets as modes of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of facile synthesized biocompatible keratin-copper nanoparticles against multidrug resistant uro-pathogens.
T2  - World journal of microbiology & biotechnology
AB  - Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis are two of the most prevalent uro-pathogens and are difficult to treat as they acquire multidrug-resistant traits. In this study, the main objective was to develop biocompatible copper nanoparticles using chicken feather keratin protein (CuNPs-K) and to investigate their impact on multidrug-resistant (MDR) uro-pathogens, E. coli and E. faecalis, under both single and mixed culture conditions. CuNPs-K were characterised by UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and docking experiments. The MIC values of CuNPs-K against single and mixed planktonic cultures were 50 μg/ml and 75 μg/ml, respectively. CuNPs-K efficiently disrupted the biofilm of single and mixed uro-pathogen cultures by eliminating sessile cells. This biofilm disruption may be attributed to a decline in the production of extracellular polymeric substances in both single and mixed bacterial cultures treated with CuNPs-K. Moreover, selective antimicrobial activity was determined by selectivity assays using T24 cells. CuNPs-K targets both the bacterial membrane and DNA with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as their bactericidal mode of action. This comprehensive antimicrobial activity of CuNPs-K was further confirmed in vivo by using the zebra fish model. In this study, CuNPs-K effectively reduced bacterial load with increased survivability of infected zebrafish. All these results suggest that CuNPs-K can be explored as an exceptional antibacterial agent against MDR uro-pathogenic E. coli and E. faecalis.

TI  - High-throughput Chemical Screening Identifies Focal Adhesion Kinase and Aurora Kinase B Inhibition as a Synergistic Treatment Combination in Ewing Sarcoma.
T2  - Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
AB  - PURPOSE: Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive solid tumor malignancy of childhood. Although current treatment regimens cure approximately 70% of patients with localized disease, they are ineffective for most patients with metastases or relapse. New treatment combinations are necessary for these patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) for growth. To identify candidate treatment combinations for Ewing sarcoma, we performed a small-molecule library screen to identify compounds synergistic with FAK inhibitors in impairing Ewing cell growth. The activity of a top-scoring class of compounds was then validated across multiple Ewing cell lines in vitro and in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. RESULTS: Numerous Aurora kinase inhibitors scored as synergistic with FAK inhibition in this screen. We found that Aurora kinase B inhibitors were synergistic across a larger range of concentrations than Aurora kinase A inhibitors when combined with FAK inhibitors in multiple Ewing cell lines. The combination of AZD-1152, an Aurora kinase B-selective inhibitor, and PF-562271 or VS-4718, FAK-selective inhibitors, induced apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma cells at concentrations that had minimal effects on survival when cells were treated with either drug alone. We also found that the combination significantly impaired tumor progression in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: FAK and Aurora kinase B inhibitors synergistically impair Ewing sarcoma cell viability and significantly inhibit tumor progression. This study provides preclinical support for the consideration of a clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of this combination for patients with Ewing sarcoma.

TI  - Pinostrobin Exerts Neuroprotective Actions in Neurotoxin-Induced Parkinson's Disease Models through Nrf2 Induction.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the neuroprotective effects of pinostrobin (PSB), a dietary bioflavonoid, and its underlying mechanisms in neurotoxin-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) models. First, PSB could attenuate 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and improve behavior deficiency in zebrafish, supporting its potential neuroprotective actions in vivo. Next, PSB could decreased apoptosis and death in the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells, evidenced by MTT, LDH, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and DNA fragmentation assay. PSB also blocked MPP(+)-induced apoptotic cascades, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase 3, and reduced ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition, PSB suppressed MPP(+)-induced oxidative stress but increased antioxidant enzymes, evidenced by decrease of reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation and up-regulation of GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, GSH/GSSG, and NAD/NADH. Further investigations showed that PSB significantly enhanced Nrf2 expression and nuclear accumulation, improved ARE promoter activity and up-regulated expression of HO-1 and GCLC. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown via specific Nrf2 siRNA abolished PSB-induced antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects against MPP(+) insults. Interestingly, we then found that PSB promoted phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and ERK, and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/AKT or ERK signaling diminished PSB-induced Nrf2/ARE activation and protective actions. In summary, PSB confers neuroprotection against MPTP/MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity in PD models. Promoting activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling contributes to PSB-mediated antioxidative and neuroprotective actions, which, in part, is mediated by PI3K/AKT and ERK.

TI  - Analysis of the Oxidative Stress Regulon Identifies soxS as a Genetic Target for Resistance Reversal in Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
T2  - mBio
AB  - In bacteria, the defense system deployed to counter oxidative stress is orchestrated by three transcriptional factors, SoxS, SoxR, and OxyR. Although the regulon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity, allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels, was further evaluated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP(+)) accumulation assay. The soxS mutant was also susceptible to tetracycline in vivo in a zebrafish embryo model. We conclude that the soxS gene could be considered a genetic target against which an inhibitor could be developed and used in combinatorial therapy to combat infections associated with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is a global health challenge. Few new antibiotics have been developed for use over the years, and preserving the efficacy of existing compounds is an important step to protect public health. This paper describes a study that examines the effects of exogenously induced oxidative stress on K. pneumoniae and uncovers a target that could be useful to harness as a strategy to mitigate resistance.

TI  - RNase A ribonucleases and host defense: an evolving story.
T2  - Journal of leukocyte biology
AB  - RNase A (bovine pancreatic RNase) is the founding member an extensive family of divergent proteins that share specific elements of sequence homology, a unique disulfide-bonded tertiary structure, and the ability to hydrolyze polymeric RNA. Among the more intriguing and perhaps counterintuitive findings, at the current state of the art, the connection between RNase activity and characterized host defense functions is quite weak; whether this is a scientific reality or more a reflection of what has been chosen for study remains to be determined. Several of the RNase A family RNases are highly cationic and have cytotoxic and bactericidal properties that are clearly (eosinophil cationic protein, leukocyte RNase A-2) or are probably (RNase 7) unrelated to their enzymatic activity. Interestingly, peptides derived from the leukocyte RNase A-2 sequence are nearly as bactericidal as the entire protein, suggesting that among other functions, the RNase A superfamily may be serving as a source of gene scaffolds for the generation of novel cytotoxic peptides. Other RNase A ribonucleases are somewhat less cationic (mouse angiogenin 4, zebrafish RNases) and have moderate bactericidal activities that have not yet been explored mechanistically. Additional host defense functions characterized specifically for the RNase eosinophil-derived neurotoxin include reducing infectivity of RNA viruses for target cells in culture, which does require RNase activity, chemoattraction of immature human dendritic cells via a G-protein-coupled receptor-dependent mechanism, and activation of TLR2. The properties of individual RNase A ribonucleases, recent experimental findings, and important questions for the near and distant future will be reviewed.

TI  - The antibiotic clofoctol suppresses glioma stem cell proliferation by activating KLF13.
T2  - The Journal of clinical investigation
AB  - Gliomas account for approximately 80% of primary malignant tumors in the central nervous system. Despite aggressive therapy, the prognosis of patients remains extremely poor. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) which considered as the potential target of therapy for their crucial role in therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence, are believed to be key factors for the disappointing outcome. Here, we took advantage of GSCs as the cell model to perform high-throughput drug screening and the old antibiotic, clofoctol, was identified as the most effective compound, showing reduction of colony-formation and induction of apoptosis of GSCs. Moreover, growth of tumors was inhibited obviously in vivo after clofoctol treatment especially in primary patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and transgenic xenografts. The anticancer mechanisms demonstrated by analyzing related downstream genes and discovering the targeted binding protein revealed that clofoctol exhibited the inhibition of GSCs by upregulation of Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13), a tumor suppressor gene, through clofoctol's targeted binding protein, Upstream of N-ras (UNR). Collectively, these data demonstrated that induction of KLF13 expression suppressed growth of gliomas and provided a potential therapy for gliomas targeting GSCs. Importantly, our results also identified the RNA-binding protein UNR as a drug target.

TI  - Self-Assemblies Based on Traditional Medicine Berberine and Cinnamic Acid for Adhesion-Induced Inhibition Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
T2  - ACS applied materials & interfaces
AB  - S. aureus is resistant to various first-line antibiotics, and seeking multifarious strategies aimed at effective control of antibiotic-resistant behavior is urgently needed. Here, we report a two-component directed self-assembly mode: the phytochemicals berberine and cinnamic acid can directly self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) displaying good bacteriostastic activity. Compared with several first-line antibiotics, the obtained nanostructures have a better inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and stronger ability for biofilm removal. These qualities are attributed to the fact that organic assemblies can first spontaneously adhere to the surface of the bacteria, infiltrate into the cell, and then lead to converging attack against MRSA; thereafter, multipath bactericidal mechanisms of NPs on MRSA are found by both transcriptomic analysis and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis. Moreover, when combined with spectral data and single crystal X-ray diffraction, the NPs' self-assembly mechanism governed by hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions is clearly elucidated. These non-covalent interactions induce the NPs' formation of butterfly-like one-dimensional self-assembled units and finally layered three-dimensional spatial configuration. In addition, biocompatibility tests show that the NPs are nonhemolytic with little toxicity in vitro and in vivo. This directed self-assembly mode can offer a new perspective toward the design of biocompatible antimicrobial nanomedicines for clinical translation.

TI  - NIR fluorescent probe based on a modified rhodol-dye with good water solubility and large Stokes shift for monitoring CO in living systems.
T2  - Talanta
AB  - Because of the biological importance of CO, the development of effective probes for the detection of CO in living systems is of great significance. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probes with good water solubility and large Stokes shift are indispensable tools for CO detection in vivo. However, such tools are extremely scarce. Herein, a modified rhodol dye was used to develop a novel NIR fluorescent probe (Rh-NIR-CO) for selective and sensitive detection of CO using the Pd(0)-mediated Tsuji-Trost reaction. This probe shows good water solubility and rapid CO detecting ability in aqueous buffer at pH 7.4, accompanied by distinct colorimetric and turn-on NIR emission changes at 676 nm with a large Stokes shift (135 nm) and low detection limit (37 nM). Moreover, NIR fluorescence imaging of CO in living cells, zebrafish, and living mice was successfully applied with this probe. These excellent results highlighted Rh-NIR-CO as a promising new tool for in vitro and in vivo detection of CO.

AB  - In this study, we explored the pharmaceutically underexploited mycobacterial gyrase ATPase (GyrB) domain as a template for a structure-based virtual screening of our in-house (BITS Pilani) compound collection to discover new inhibitors targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) The hit identified was further customized by using a combination of molecular docking and medicinal chemistry strategies to obtain an optimized analogue displaying considerable in vitro enzyme efficacy and bactericidal properties against the M.tb. H37 Rv strain. The binding affinity of the ligand toward the GyrB domain was reascertained by differential scanning fluorimetry experiments. Further evaluation of the hERG toxicity (a major limitation among the previously reported N-linked aminopiperidine analogues) indicated these molecules to be completely devoid of cardiotoxicity, a significant achievement within this class.

TI  - Therapeutic effects of multifunctional tetramethylpyrazine nitrone on models of Parkinson's disease in vitro and in vivo.
T2  - Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Although the etiology of PD is not completely understood, it is well-documented that oxidative stress and Ca(2+)-mediated cellular damage play important roles in the progression of PD. 2-[[(1,1-Dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a novel nitrone derivative of tetramethylpyrazine, has shown significant therapeutic effects in stroke models due to its multiple functions, including calcium overload blockade and free radical-scavenging. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorescue effects of TBN on various in vitro and in vivo models of PD and explored its possible mechanisms of action. The results show that TBN exerted significant neuroprotection on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells and primary dopaminergic neurons, as well as on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish (TBN and MPTP were added simultaneously into the fish embryo medium and the treatment period was 48 h). In the MPTP-induced mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat PD models, TBN administrated orally twice daily for 14 d (3 d post-MPTP lesion in mice and 7 d post-6-OHDA lesion in rats) exhibited remarkable neurorescue effects to increase the number of dopaminergic neurons. In addition, TBN improved apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-lesioned PD rats. TBN suppressed the MPP(+)-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells, increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) concentration in the substantial nigra of MPTP-treated mice. These data indicate that TBN protects and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPP(+) and MPTP/6-OHDA-induced damage by reducing ROS and increasing cellular antioxidative defense capability.

TI  - Identification and development of benzoxazole derivatives as novel bacterial glutamate racemase inhibitors.
T2  - European journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - In the present study, we attempted to develop novel class of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inhibitors by exploring the pharmaceutically underexploited enzyme targets which are majorly involved in cell wall biosynthesis of mycobacteria. For this purpose glutamate racemase was selected which racemizes d-glutamate from l-glutamate, a key step in peptidoglycan synthesis. Furthermore, enzyme is neither expressed nor its product, d-glutamate is produced in mammals, and hence inhibiting this enzyme will have no vulnerable effect in host organism. A library of our in-house compounds were screened against glutamate racemase using a biophysical technique; thermal shift assay and further by enzyme inhibition assay to identify Lead 1 molecule. Lead 1 optimization and expansion resulted in twenty four compounds. Among the synthesized compounds twelve compounds shown good enzyme inhibition than Lead 1 (IC(50) 20.07 ± 0.29 μM). Among all the compounds; compound 22 (IC(50) 1.1 ± 0.52 μM) showed potent non-competitive mode of inhibition in enzyme assay. Further showed good susceptibility (in replicating bacteria) of MIC 8.72 μM and bactericidal time dependant kill on dormant culture. It also exhibited significant activity in Mtb nutrient starvation model (2.5) and Mtb biofilm model (2.4) and in vivo M. marinum infected Zebra fish model studies (3.6) reduction at logarithmic scale.

TI  - Toxicity of the organophosphate insecticide sumithion to embryo and larvae of zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicology reports
AB  - Sumithion, a synthetic organophosphate, is widely used as an agricultural insecticide and for control of tiger bug (Cicindela spp.) in larval rearing for aquaculture. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of sumithion on embryological and larval development of zebrafish Danio rerio. Fertilized egg (n = 100) and larvae (n = 100) were exposed to six concentrations of sumithion (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg L(-1)) in three replicates. LC(50) values for embryos and larvae were calculated by probit analysis. The 24 h LC(50) value of sumithion for embryo was 0.235 (0.079-0.428) mgL(-1). Increasing sumithion concentrations decreased hatching success and increased embryonic mortality. In embryos, sumithion induced several malformations including immature yolk sac, dark yolk sac, yolk sac bud, broken eggshell and notochord, unhatched eggs. Larval LC(50) values at 24, 48 and 72 h of various doses of sumithion exposure were 0.620 (0.436-0.963), 0.475 (0.302-0.801) and 0.341 (0.177-0.617) mgL(-1), respectively. Various physical deformities, including edema, notochord deformity, yolk sac damage, body arcuation, lordosis and black pigmentation on the yolk sac were evident in response to different concentrations of sumithion. The results of the current study indicate that sumithion exerts developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos and larvae. It is expected that current findings will increase sensitivity about the toxic effect of sumithion in early development, as well the possibility of similar actions induced by other insecticides and pesticides.

TI  - Naringin attenuates cisplatin- and aminoglycoside-induced hair cell injury in the zebrafish lateral line via multiple pathways.
T2  - Journal of cellular and molecular medicine
AB  - Exposure to ototoxic drugs is a significant cause of hearing loss that affects about 30 thousand children with potentially serious physical, social and psychological dysfunctions every year. Cisplatin (CP) and aminoglycosides are effective antineoplastic or bactericidal drugs, and their application has a high probability of ototoxicity which results from the death of hair cells (HCs). Here, we describe the therapeutic effect of the flavonoid compound naringin (Nar) against ototoxic effects of cisplatin and aminoglycosides include gentamicin (GM) and neomycin (Neo) in zebrafish HCs. Animals incubated with Nar (100-400 μmol/L) were protected against the pernicious effects of CP (150-250 μmol/L), GM (50-150 μmol/L) and Neo (50-150 μmol/L). We also provide evidence for the potential mechanism of Nar against ototoxicity, including antioxidation, anti-apoptosis, promoting proliferation and hair cell regeneration. We found that mRNA levels of the apoptotic- and pyroptosis-related genes are regulated by Nar both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, by proving that Nar does not affect the anti-tumour efficacy of CP and antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides in vitro, we highlight its value in clinical application. In conclusion, these results unravel a novel therapeutic role for Nar as an otoprotective drug against the adverse effects of CP and aminoglycosides.

TI  - Suspended animation extends survival limits of Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at low temperature.
T2  - Molecular biology of the cell
AB  - The orderly progression through the cell division cycle is of paramount importance to all organisms, as improper progression through the cycle could result in defects with grave consequences. Previously, our lab has shown that model eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Danio rerio all retain high viability after prolonged arrest in a state of anoxia-induced suspended animation, implying that in such a state, progression through the cell division cycle is reversibly arrested in an orderly manner. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae (both wild-type and several cold-sensitive strains) and C. elegans embryos exhibit a dramatic decrease in viability that is associated with dysregulation of the cell cycle when exposed to low temperatures. Further, we find that when the yeast or worms are first transitioned into a state of anoxia-induced suspended animation before cold exposure, the associated cold-induced viability defects are largely abrogated. We present evidence that by imposing an anoxia-induced reversible arrest of the cell cycle, the cells are prevented from engaging in aberrant cell cycle events in the cold, thus allowing the organisms to avoid the lethality that would have occurred in a cold, oxygenated environment.

TI  - Atrazine Exposure Induces Hepatic Metabolism Disorder in Male Adult Zebrafish.
T2  - Toxics
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is a herbicide used in agricultural production and has been detected in surface water due to its widespread use worldwide. This may pose a threat to the health of aquatic animals. To explore the ATZ-induced hepatic metabolism disorder, male zebrafish were exposed to 300 and 1000 μg/L ATZ for 21 days, respectively. The results revealed that ATZ exposure significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels, while significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased pyruvate (PYR) and total cholesterol (TC) levels. In addition, the liver sample from the 1000 μg/L ATZ-treated group was used for GC/MS metabolomic analysis. The principal component analysis (PCA) model showed significant separation of the 1000 μg/L ATZ group from the control group, indicating that ATZ exposure altered hepatic metabolism in male adult zebrafish. A total of 29 significantly (p &lt; 0.05) different metabolites were observed and identified in the ATZ-treated group. Moreover, the most disturbed pathways by ATZ were the arginine and proline metabolic pathways, followed by the glutathione metabolic pathway. Three and two metabolites were significantly altered in the arginine and proline metabolic pathways and glutathione metabolic pathway, respectively. Based on these results, we suggested that ATZ was capable of altering liver metabolism in zebrafish and that its ecological risk to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored.

TI  - Crystal Structures of Human GlyRα3 Bound to Ivermectin.
T2  - Structure (London, England : 1993)
AB  - Ivermectin acts as a positive allosteric modulator of several Cys-loop receptors including the glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls), γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)Rs), glycine receptors (GlyRs), and neuronal α7-nicotinic receptors (α7 nAChRs). The crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans GluCl complexed with ivermectin revealed the details of its ivermectin binding site. Although the electron microscopy structure of zebrafish GlyRα1 complexed with ivermectin demonstrated a similar binding orientation, detailed structural information on the ivermectin binding and pore opening for Cys-loop receptors in vertebrates has been elusive. Here we present the crystal structures of human GlyRα3 in complex with ivermectin at 2.85 and 3.08 Å resolution. Our structures allow us to explore in detail the molecular recognition of ivermectin by GlyRs, GABA(A)Rs, and α7 nAChRs. Comparisons with previous structures reveal how the ivermectin binding expands the ion channel pore. Our results hold promise in structure-based design of GlyR modulators for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

TI  - Chemicals sorbed to environmental microplastics are toxic to early life stages of aquatic organisms.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, but little information is currently available on the dangers and risks to living organisms. In order to assess the ecotoxicity of environmental microplastics (MPs), samples were collected from the beaches of two islands in the Guadeloupe archipelago, Petit-Bourg (PB) located on the main island of Guadeloupe and Marie-Galante (MG) on the second island of the archipelago. These samples have a similar polymer composition with mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). However, these two samples are very dissimilar with regard to their contamination profile and their toxicity. MPs from MG contain more lead, cadmium and organochlorine compounds while those from PB have higher levels of copper, zinc and hydrocarbons. The leachates of these two samples of MPs induced sublethal effects on the growth of sea urchins and on the pulsation frequency of jellyfish ephyrae but not on the development of zebrafish embryos. The toxic effects are much more marked for samples from the PB site than those from the MG site. This work demonstrates that MPs can contain high levels of potentially bioavailable toxic substances that may represent a significant ecotoxicological risk, particularly for the early life stages of aquatic animals.

TI  - Metabolomics analysis of the potential toxicological mechanisms of diquat dibromide herbicide in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) liver.
T2  - Fish physiology and biochemistry
AB  - Although diquat is a widely used water-soluble herbicide in the world, its sublethal adverse effects to fish have not been well characterised. In this study, histopathological examination and biochemical assays were applied to assess hepatotoxicity and combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis to reveal overall metabolic mechanisms in the liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio) after diquat exposure at concentrations of 0.34 and 1.69 mg·L(-1) for 21 days. Results indicated that 1.69 mg·L(-1) diquat exposure caused cellular vacuolisation and degeneration with nuclear abnormality and led to the disturbance of antioxidative system and dysfunction in the liver. No evident pathological injury was detected, and changes in liver biochemistry were not obvious in the fish exposed to 0.34 mg·L(-1) diquat. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed differences between profiles obtained by GC-MS spectrometry from control and two treatment groups. A total of 17 and 22 metabolites belonging to different classes were identified following exposure to 0.34 and 1.69 mg·L(-1) diquat, respectively. The metabolic changes in the liver of zebrafish are mainly manifested as inhibition of energy metabolism, disorders of amino acid metabolism and reduction of antioxidant capacity caused by 1.69 mg·L(-1) diquat exposure. The energy metabolism of zebrafish exposed to 0.34 mg·L(-1) diquat was more inclined to rely on anaerobic glycolysis than that of normal zebrafish, and interference effects on lipid metabolism were observed. The metabolomics approach provided an innovative perspective to explore possible hepatic damages on fish induced by diquat as a basis for further research.

TI  - Study on the toxic-mechanism of triclosan chronic exposure to zebrafish (Danio rerio) based on gut-brain axis.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Triclosan (TCS), as a broad-spectrum bactericide, is extensively used in the fine chemical and textile industries. It is recognized as a new type of environmental endocrine disruptor with frequent detection and environmental pollution. However, the toxicity mechanism regarding neurodevelopment and neurobehavior remains unclear. This study is intended to explore the underlying toxic mechanism of TCS based on gut-brain axis. TCS-chronic exposure affected the development of zebrafish, induced feminization, obesity physical signs and abnormal organ index and caused neurobehavioral abnormalities by inhibiting both neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase and dopamine activity, promoting brain neuron apoptosis and accelerating diencephalic lesions. Meanwhile, TCS-chronic exposure led to gut microbiota dysbiosis and decreased diversity, such as increased pathogenic bacteria and decreased probiotics in adult zebrafish gut, which caused many pathological damages, including partial shedding and ablation of intestinal villi, inflammatory infiltration, thinning of intestinal wall, and increased goblet cell in villus. Based on the communication between intestinal peripheral nerves and CNS, the above histopathological injuries and disorders were well underpinned and illustrated by the changes of biomarkers and the expression of related marker genes in the gut-brain axis. Additionally, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), as the regulators of intestinal sympathetic nerve activation, are also secreting products of intestinal microflora and play a crucial role in regulating the balance of intestinal flora and protecting intestinal homeostasis. SCFA in low doses can effectively alleviate and rescue the toxic effects under TCS exposure, which evidenced that TCS exerted systemic toxic effects on the gut-brain axis by influencing the composition and diversity of gut flora in zebrafish, and fully demonstrated the interaction effect between intestine and brain. Hence, these findings contribute to the understanding, prevention, and diagnosis of endocrine disrupting diseases caused by environmental pollutants from the perspective of the gut-brain axis, and strengthening the early warning, management and control of TCS pollution.

TI  - Analysis of endocrine disruption in Southern California coastal fish using an aquatic multispecies microarray.
T2  - Environmental health perspectives
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocrine disruptors include plasticizers, pesticides, detergents, and pharmaceuticals. Turbot and other flatfish are used to characterize the presence of chemicals in the marine environment. Unfortunately, there are relatively few genes of turbot and other flatfish in GenBank, which limits the use of molecular tools such as microarrays and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to study disruption of endocrine responses in sentinel fish captured by regulatory agencies. OBJECTIVES: We fabricated a multigene cross-species microarray as a diagnostic tool to screen the effects of environmental chemicals in fish, for which there is minimal genomic information. The array included genes that are involved in the actions of adrenal and sex steroids, thyroid hormone, and xenobiotic responses. This microarray will provide a sensitive tool for screening for the presence of chemicals with adverse effects on endocrine responses in coastal fish species. METHODS: We used a custom multispecies microarray to study gene expression in wild hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) collected from polluted and clean coastal waters and in laboratory male zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to estradiol and 4-nonylphenol. We measured gene-specific expression in turbot liver by qRT-PCR and correlated it to microarray data. RESULTS: Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses of livers from turbot collected from polluted areas revealed altered gene expression profiles compared with those from nonaffected areas. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between the array data and qRT-PCR analyses validates this multispecies microarray. The microarray measurement of gene expression in zebrafish, which are phylogenetically distant from turbot, indicates that this multispecies microarray will be useful for measuring endocrine responses in other fish.

TI  - Effect of monosultap on notochord development in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Toxicology
AB  - Monosultap (Mon) is a broad-spectrum insecticide used in agricultural production to control stem borers in rice fields. Currently, little evidence shows how Mon affects notochord development in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In our study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75mg/L Mon to determine the effects of different concentrations of Mon on notochord development. Mon exposure reduced the body length, decreased the heart rate and hatchability, and induced notochord deformity in zebrafish. The effects of Mon exposure on the internal organization of the notochord and the structural abnormalities were determined based on histological staining of paraffinized tissue sections. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and in situ hybridization findings revealed that the expression levels of genes related to notochord development (shha, col2a, and ptch2) showed an increasing trend in a concentration-dependent manner. An abnormal increase of apoptosis and cell proliferation in some parts of the notochord suggested that Mon exposure could cause developmental abnormality of the notochord. This study revealed the toxicity of Mon in notochord development. Our findings provide information in assessing the risk of Mon to the ecological environment and human health.

TI  - Assessment of impacts of diphenyl phosphate on groundwater and near-surface environments: Sorption and toxicity.
T2  - Journal of contaminant hydrology
AB  - Wastewater recovered from hydraulic fracturing is referred to as flowback and produced water (FPW), and is often saline, contains numerous organic and inorganic constituents, and may pose threats to groundwater resources. Hundreds of spills of FPW have been reported to the Alberta Energy Regulator each year. Recently, samples of FPW derived from hydraulic fracturing of the Duvernay Formation, AB, were found to contain a previously unidentified class of aryl phosphates, including diphenyl phosphate (DPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and others. Aryl phosphates are also used in a variety of other industries and their constituents can be found in flame retardants, plasticizers, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, and oxidizers. Many of these aryl phosphates break down into DPP. Therefore, it is important to determine the environmental fate and potential impact of DPP if spilled in the near-surface, as DPP is an emerging contaminant in soil and groundwater systems. This study was aimed at determining 1) the sorption behavior of DPP onto various surficial sediments collected within the Fox Creek, AB region, and 2) the toxicity of DPP toward aquatic ecosystems. We report that the sorption of DPP onto both clay-rich soils and sandy sediment was low compared to that of other aryl phosphates, with an average log K(OC) value of 2.30 ± 0.42 (1σ). Therefore, the transport of DPP in groundwater would be rapid due to its low degree of sorption on surficial materials. We also determined the acute 96 h-LC(50) of DPP on zebrafish embryos to be 50.0 ± 7.1 mg/L. Su et al. (2014) studied the toxic effects of DPP and TPP on chicken embryonic hepatocytes and found that DPP had less cytotoxic effects than TPP but altered more gene transcripts. From the results our study, we infer that DPP may pose an environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems if released into the environment.

T2  - Medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of 4 non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin in Asians with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in real-world practice through a network meta-analysis of observational studies. METHODS: We searched multiple comprehensive databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library) for studies published until August 2020. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used for the pooled estimates. Efficacy outcomes included ischemic stroke (IS), stroke/systemic embolism (SSE), myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause mortality, and safety outcomes included major bleeding, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The P score was calculated for ranking probabilities. Subgroup analyses were separately performed in accordance with the dosage range of NOACs ("standard-" and "low-dose"). RESULTS: A total of 11, 6, and 8 studies were allocated to the total population, standard-dose group, and low-dose group, respectively. In the total study population, edoxaban ranked the best in terms of IS and ICH prevention and apixaban ranked the best for SSE, major bleeding, and GI bleeding. In the standard-dose regimen, apixaban ranked the best in terms of IS and SSE prevention. For major bleeding, GI bleeding, and ICH, edoxaban ranked the best. In the low-dose regimen, edoxaban ranked the best for IS, SSE, GI bleeding, and ICH prevention. For major bleeding prevention, apixaban ranked best. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 NOACs had different efficacy and safety outcomes according to their type and dosage. Apixaban and edoxaban might be relatively better and more well-balanced treatment for Asian patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Dose-dependent Effect of Boric Acid on Myogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-derived Stem Cells (hADSCs).
T2  - Biological trace element research
AB  - Boron, a vital micronutrient for plant metabolism, is not fully elucidated for embryonic and adult body development, and tissue regeneration. Although optimized amount of boron supplement has been shown to be essential for normal gestational development in zebrafish and frog and beneficial for bone regeneration in higher animals, effects of boron on myogenesis and myo-regeneration remains to be solved. In the current study, we investigated dose-dependent activity of boric acid on myogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) using immunocytochemical, gene, and protein expression analysis. The results revealed that while low- (81.9 μM) and high-dose (819.6 μM) boron treatment increased myogenic gene expression levels such as myosin heavy chain (MYH), MyoD, myogenin, and desmin at day 4 of differentiation, high-dose treatment decreased myogenic-related gene and protein levels at day 21 of differentiation, confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis. The findings of the study present not only an understanding of boron's effect on myogenic differentiation but also an opportunity for the development of scaffolds to be used in skeletal tissue engineering and supplements for embryonic muscle growth. However, fine dose tuning and treatment period arranging are highly warranted as boron treatment over required concentrations and time might result in detrimental outcomes to myogenesis and myo-regeneration.

TI  - mRNA-Sequencing Identifies Liver as a Potential Target Organ for Triphenyl Phosphate in Embryonic Zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a commonly used organophosphate flame retardant and plasticizer in the United States. Using zebrafish as a model, the overall objective of this study was to identify potential organs that might be targeted by TPHP during embryonic development. Based on mRNA-sequencing, TPHP exposure from 24 to 30 h post fertilization (hpf) and 24 to 48 hpf significantly affected the abundance of 305 and 274 transcripts, respectively, relative to vehicle (0.1% DMSO) controls. In addition to minor effects on cardiotoxicity- and nephrotoxicity-related pathways, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of significantly affected transcripts within 30- and 48-hpf embryos revealed that hepatotoxicity-related pathways were strongly affected following exposure to TPHP alone. Moreover, while pre-treatment with fenretinide (a retinoic acid receptor agonist) mitigated TPHP-induced pericardial edema and liver enlargement at 72 hpf and 128 hpf, respectively, IPA revealed that fenretinide was unable to block TPHP-induced effects on cardiotoxicity-, nephrotoxicity-, and hepatotoxicity-related pathways at 48 hpf, suggesting that TPHP-induced effects on the transcriptome were not associated with toxicity later in development. In addition, based on Oil Red O staining, we found that exposure to TPHP nearly abolished neutral lipids from the embryonic head and trunk and, based on metabolomics, significantly decreased the total abundance of metabolites - including betaine, a known osmoprotectant - at 48 and 72 hpf. Overall, our data suggest that, in addition to the heart, TPHP exposure during early development results in adverse effects on the liver, lipid utilization, and osmoregulation within embryonic zebrafish.

TI  - Expression and biological activity of lytic proteins HolST-3 and LysST-3 of Salmonella phage ST-3.
T2  - Microbial pathogenesis
AB  - Salmonella infection is a major public health concern. Several strategies for Salmonella infection prevention and control are currently available including vaccines and antibiotics. However, vaccines are expensive and inefficient, and the use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance. Thus, alternative strategies for the treatment of Salmonella remain warrant. In this study, recombinant holin HolST-3 and lysin LysST-3 from Salmonella phage ST-3 were expressed and purified, and their bactericidal properties were analyzed. HolST-3 and LysST-3 possessed a wider lysis spectrum and more efficient bactericidal effect than phage ST-3, and a synergistic bactericidal effect was observed when combined in vitro. In addition, we explored the bactericidal properties of HolST-3 and LysST-3 in vivo using zebrafish as a model organism, and found that the bactericidal effects of both HolST-3 and LysST-3 in vivo were comparable to those of cefotaxime, an antibiotic. This study provides a basis for the development of HolST-3 and LysST-3 as novel bactericidal agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases caused by Salmonella spp.

TI  - Transcriptional responses of fluxapyroxad-induced dysfunctional heart in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - Fluxapyroxad (FLU) is a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide used in controlling crop diseases. Potential toxicity to aquatic organisms is not known. We exposed zebrafish to 1, 2, and 4 μM FLU for 3 days. The embryonic zebrafish showed developmental cardiac defects, including heart malformation, pericardial edema, and heart rate reduction. Compared with the controls, cardiac-specific transcription factors (nkx2.5, myh7, myl7, and myh6) exhibited dysregulated expression patterns after FLU treatment. We next used transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses to explore the molecular mechanism of FLU cardiotoxicity. The transcriptome analysis and interaction network showed that the downregulated genes were enriched in calcium signaling pathways, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and cardiac muscle contraction. FLU exposure repressed the cardio-related calcium signaling pathway, associated with apoptosis in the heart and other manifestations of cardiotoxicity. Thus, the findings provide valuable evidence that FLU exposure causes disruption of cardiac development in zebrafish embryos. Our findings will help to promote a better understanding of the toxicity mechanisms of FLU and act as a reference to explore the rational use and safety of FLU in agriculture.

TI  - Reproductive toxicity of long-term exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of cyprodinil in female zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - In recent years, the widespread use of the pesticide cyprodinil has attracted attention due to its harmful effects on aquatic organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adverse effects of long-term exposure to cyprodinil on the reproductive system of female zebrafish. After the embryos had been treated with 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/L cyprodinil for 180 days, we observed that female fish treated with 1 and 10 μg/L cyprodinil showed decreased sexual attractiveness, a decreased proportion of primordial follicles in the ovary, an increased proportion of mature follicles, and increased egg production. Moreover, exposed females that mated with normal males produced offspring with increased rates of mortality and deformity (the F1 generation). In addition, the levels of gonadotropin and testosterone (T) were increased in females after cyprodinil exposure, especially in the 10 μg/L treated group. After cyprodinil treatment, some key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis underwent significant changes. For example, gene expression of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (gnrhr1, gnrhr2 and gnrhr4) was significantly downregulated after cyprodinil treatment. The study found that expression of the aromatase (cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1a, cyp19a1a) responsible for converting T into estradiol was significantly downregulated after cyprodinil treatment, consistent with elevated T levels in the ovaries and muscles. In summary, these data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the toxicity of cyprodinil and may inform evaluation of the ecotoxicity of cyprodinil to female reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.

TI  - Ethoprophos induces cardiac toxicity in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Ethoprophos is an effective and widely pesticide that used in controlling nemathelminth and soil insect. However, ethoprophos has been frequently detected in environment and freshwater. The potential toxicity to aquatic organisms is still not be explored. In this study, zebrafish embryo model was used to evaluated the toxicity of ethoprophos during cardiovascular developmental process of zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos were separately exposed to 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 40 mg/L and 50 mg/L of ethoprophos exposure at 96 h post-fertilization (hpf), which induced cardiac defects, such as low heart rate, pericardium edema and long SV-BA distance, but had no influence to vascular development. Mechanistically, the expression of cardiac-related genes were abnormal. Moreover, ethoprophos exposure significantly increased oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos by inhibiting the production of antioxidant enzyme (SOD) and activating reactive oxygen species. Expectedly, some apoptosis genes were induced and the apoptotic cardiomyocytes were detected by acridine orange staining. In addition, ethoprophos exposure also inhibited the expression of genes in wnt signaling pathway, such as β-catenin, Axin2, GSK3β and Sox9b. BML284, an activator of wnt signaling pathway, can rescue the cardiotoxic effect of embryos. These results indicated that oxidative stress and blocking wnt signaling pathway were molecular basis of ethoprophos-induced injure in zebrafish. Generally, our study showed that ethoprophos exposure led to severe cardiotoxicity to zebrafish embryo.

AB  - Palladium has attracted a growing number of attention due to its widely application and environmental toxicity. Consequently, a novel colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on probe (NT-Pd) was designed for sensing of palladium. This probe was capable of detecting palladium in aqueous solution (DMSO was less than 1%, v/v). Under this mild condition, NT-Pd displayed high selectivity and sensitivity for sensing of palladium in both colorimetric and fluorescent strategy, such as low detection limit (5.30 nM) and rapid response time (within 10 min). In addition, NT-Pd was successfully applied for imaging of exogenous palladium in living cells and zebrafishes with good biocompatibility and low toxicity, indicating this probe has satisfactory application potential to track palladium in the complicated biological system.

TI  - Developing a screening test for toxicity studies of prenatal development with the use of Hydra attenuata and embryos of zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicology reports
AB  - 11 active substances used in pesticides were selected. Substances were divided into three groups depending the effect on embryos or fetuses of laboratory animals: 1 - damaging effect on embryos or fetuses (embryotoxic, fetotoxic or teratogenic), 2 - damaging effect on embryos or fetuses, but only at dose toxic for mother (maternal toxicity), 3 - no damaging effect. Changes for hydra in acute toxicity tests and recovery tests were assessed on an change scale from 0 to 10. The index of the effect on development (TI) for hydras was calculated for every compound. Changes in zebrafish embryos were assessed using a descriptive method. Pearson correlation coefficient showed the correlation between the concentration and the toxic effect in the zebrafish embryos for the substances of the first group. The study showed that substances having a strong damaging effect on fetuses cause changes that are apparent and easy to evaluate both in hydras and zebrafish embryos. A scoring system was introduced to evaluate the changes of hydras and zebrafish embryos. The point system of evaluation of changes allows quick classification of a substance as potentially embryotoxic, fetotoxic or teratogenic. It allows developing a cheap and fast method alternative to prenatal developmental toxicity studies, a screening method that enables substances of great teratogenic potential to be excluded from studies on laboratory animals.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lemna minor extracts against Pseudomonas fluorescens and safety evaluation in a zebrafish model.
T2  - Saudi journal of biological sciences
AB  - The treatment of bacterial diseases in aquaculture is done using antibiotics, their applications has resulted in contamination and bacterial resistance. Natural extracts are a potential alternative as an antimicrobial, they have demonstrated effectiveness in their use aimed at treating conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Lemna minor extracts against Pseudomonas fluorescens with different solvent for extraction. Methanol, chloroform and hexane were used. Subsequently, the safety assessment of the extracts in Danio rerio embryos and larvae was performed to validate as ecologically harmless. Antibacterial activity was detected in three extracts with significant differences (p = 0.001). Hexane extract had the highest antibacterial activity, followed by chloroform and methanol extracts. The three extracts have differences with respect to the control, between times and concentrations tested (p = 0.001). Minimum inhibitory concentration values (MIC) at 24 h methanolic extract ME 0.05 µg mL(-1). In embryos and larvae increased safety of the LC(50) methanolic extract was evidenced followed by the hexane and chloroform extract. No morphological or tissue changes were observed in embryos and larvae. The hexane extracts of L. minor had a greater bactericidal effect against P. fluorescens and are functional because of their antibacterial activity, but methanolic extract is more safety in embryos and larvae of D. rerio, making it a potential alternative for use in the treatment and control of septicemia in fish.

TI  - Ursolic acid inhibits colistin efflux and curtails colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
T2  - AMB Express
AB  - Colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli is driving the evolution of pan drug resistant strains. Screening a library of 13 plant nutraceuticals led to the identification of acetyl shikonin and ursolic acid, which exhibited synergy with colistin against extremely drug resistant (XDR) clinical strains of E. coli (U3790) and K. pneumoniae (BC936). Ursolic acid caused a significant colistin MIC reversal of 16-fold in U3790 and 4-fold in BC936 strains. Ursolic acid also potentiated the bactericidal effect of colistin against both U3790 and BC936 by causing \textasciitilde 4 to 4.5 log fold decline in CFU of both clinical isolates in a time kill assay. At 2× minimum effective concentration, ursolic acid was non-toxic to zebrafish as evidenced by brain and liver enzyme profiles and by histopathology studies. In combination with colistin, ursolic acid reduced bacterial bioburden of U3790/BC936 by 1-1.58 log fold from the infected muscle tissue of zebrafish. Mechanistic explorations via studies on real time efflux, membrane potential and intracellular accumulation of dansyl chloride tagged colistin revealed that colistin efflux is inhibited by ursolic acid. In addition, ursolic acid also enhanced outer membrane permeability which probably facilitates colistin's attack on outer and inner membranes. Our study shows that ursolic acid synergizes with colistin by inhibiting colistin efflux in Enterobacteriaceae that helps to curtail colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) mRNA induction patterns in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were explored for use in environmental monitoring of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists. The cDNAs of stickleback CYP1A, CYP1B1, CYP1C1, and CYP1C2 were cloned and their basal and induced expression patterns were determined in the brain, gill, liver and kidney. Also, their induction time courses were compared after waterborne exposure to a transient (indigo) or a persistent (3,3',4,4',5-pentacholorbiphenyl PCB 126) AHR agonist. The cloned stickleback CYP1s exhibited a high amino acid sequence identity compared with their zebrafish orthologs and their constitutive tissue distribution patterns largely agreed with those reported in other species. PCB 126 (100 nM) induced different CYP1 expression patterns in the four tissues, suggesting tissue-specific regulation. Both indigo (1 nM) and PCB 126 (10 nM) induced a strong CYP1 expression in gills. However, while PCB 126 gave rise to a high and persistent induction in gills and liver, induction by indigo was transient in both organs. The number of putative dioxin response elements found in each CYP1 gene promoter roughly reflected the induction levels of the genes. The high responsiveness of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 observed in several organs suggests that three-spined stickleback is suitable for monitoring of pollution with AHR agonists.

TI  - Protective effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid against toxicity induced by alpha-cypermethrin to the liver-gut-microbiota axis in zebrafish.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - To explore whether and how 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) can relieve the toxicity to the liver-gut-microbiota axis caused by alpha-cypermethrin (α-CP), adult zebrafish were exposed to α-CP (1.0 µg L(-1)) with or without 5.0 mg L(-1) ALA supplementation. In the present work, the calculated LC(50) of α-CP+ALA was 1.15 μg L(-1), increasing about 1.16-fold compared with that of α-CP group (0.99 μg L(-1)), which indicated that ALA can alleviate the toxicity of α-CP. ALA also alleviated the histopathological lesions in the liver and gut induced by α-CP. Transcriptome sequencing of the liver showed that ALA rescues the differential expression of genes involved in the oxidation-reduction, heme metabolism, and complement activation pathways associated with dysfunctions induced by α-CP, and these findings were verified by RT-qPCR analysis and detection of the activities of enzymes in the liver-gut axis. The gut microbiota 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that α-CP alone induced gut microbial dysbiosis, which was efficiently antagonized by ALA due to decreasing the relative abundances of Cetobacterium and 3 major pathogens, and increasing the relative abundances of beneficial genera. Taken together, the results indicate that ALA might be a promising candidate for attenuating the adverse effects caused by pesticide-induced environmental pollution.

TI  - In vitro embryotoxicity and mode of antibacterial mechanistic study of gold and copper nanoparticles synthesized from Angelica keiskei (Miq.) Koidz. leaves extract.
T2  - Saudi journal of biological sciences
AB  - The present study demonstrated the in vitro embryotoxicity assessment of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) prepared from the leaves extract of Angelica keiskei (Miq.) Koidz. and addressed their mode of antibacterial mechanisms. Both AuNPs and CuNPs were rapidly synthesized and the formations were observed within 1 h and 24 h, respectively. Further the morphological images of the nanoparticles were confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) analysis of the biosynthesized AuNPs and CuNPs were matched with joint committee on powder diffraction standards (JCPDS) file no of 04-0784 and 89-5899, respectively. A strong prominent Au and Cu signals were observed through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis confirmed the responsible phytochemicals for the synthesis of AuNPs and CuNPs. In order to assess the toxic effects of AuNPs and CuNPs, bactericidal activity was performed against few of the test pathogens in which the effective inhibition was observed against Gram-negative bacteria than the Gram-positive bacteria. The mode of action and interaction of nanoparticles were performed on the bacterial pathogens and the results concluded that the interaction of nanoparticles initially initiated on the surface of the cell wall adherence followed by ruptured the cells and caused the cell death. In addition to the antibacterial activity, in vitro embryotoxicity studies were performed against zebrafish embryos and the results confirmed that 200 µg/ml concentration of AuNPs showed the embryotoxicity, whereas 2 µg/ml of CuNPs resulted the embryotoxicity. Furthermore, the morphological anomalies of zebrafish embryos revealed the toxic nature of the synthesized nanoparticles.

TI  - Comprehensive study of pydiflumetofen in Danio rerio: Enantioselective insight into the toxic mechanism and fate.
T2  - Environment international
AB  - Pydiflumetofen (PYD) is primarily used to control fungal disease. The potential risks posed by PYD enantiomers to the aquatic ecosystem are currently unclear. In this study, the enantioselective toxicity and fate of PYD in Danio rerio were investigated, and the enantioselective toxic mechanism and metabolic pathway were explored. The acute toxicity of R-PYD was 10.7-14.7-fold than that of S-PYD against Danio rerio embryos, larvae, and adults. Meanwhile, R-PYD presented a stronger effect on embryo hatching and abnormalities, adult tissue damage and oxidative stress. R-PYD inhibited the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity more than S-PYD because of its better interaction with SDH with a lower binding free energy (-59.35 kcal/mol), explaining the mechanism of enantioselective toxicity. Remarkable enantioselectivity was observed in uptake, distribution, and elimination. R-PYD showed preferential uptake with the higher uptake rate constants and slow metabolism with a longer half-life, resulting in the bioaccumulation of R-PYD with higher BCF(k) (7.37 at 0.05 mg/L and 14.69 at 0.2 mg/L). Besides, muscle is an important tissue for PYD accumulation, existing potential food risk. Eleven PYD metabolites were qualitatively identified, and the metabolic pathway was proposed, including hydroxylation, N-demethylation, demethoxylation, hydrolysation (phase Ⅰ), and acetylation and glucuronidation (phase Ⅱ). The predicted toxicity of the metabolite indicated that several highly toxic metabolites need to be considered in the future. This study provides a new perspective for evaluating the ecological and human health risks of chiral pesticides.

TI  - What Are We Putting in Our Food That Is Making Us Fat? Food Additives, Contaminants, and Other Putative Contributors to Obesity.
T2  - Current obesity reports
AB  - The "chemical obesogen" hypothesis conjectures that synthetic, environmental contaminants are contributing to the global epidemic of obesity. In fact, intentional food additives (e.g., artificial sweeteners and colors, emulsifiers) and unintentional compounds (e.g., bisphenol A, pesticides) are largely unstudied in regard to their effects on overall metabolic homeostasis. With that said, many of these contaminants have been found to dysregulate endocrine function, insulin signaling, and/or adipocyte function. Although momentum for the chemical obesogen hypothesis is growing, supportive, evidence-based research is lacking. In order to identify noxious synthetic compounds in the environment out of the thousands of chemicals that are currently in use, tools and models from toxicology should be adopted (e.g., functional high throughput screening methods, zebrafish-based assays). Finally, mechanistic insight into obesogen-induced effects will be helpful in elucidating their role in the obesity epidemic as well as preventing and reversing their effects.

TI  - Translating Neurobehavioral Toxicity Across Species From Zebrafish to Rats to Humans: Implications for Risk Assessment.
T2  - Frontiers in toxicology
AB  - There is a spectrum of approaches to neurotoxicological science from high-throughput in vitro cell-based assays, through a variety of experimental animal models to human epidemiological and clinical studies. Each level of analysis has its own advantages and limitations. Experimental animal models give essential information for neurobehavioral toxicology, providing cause-and-effect information regarding risks of neurobehavioral dysfunction caused by toxicant exposure. Human epidemiological and clinical studies give the closest information to characterizing human risk, but without randomized treatment of subjects to different toxicant doses can only give information about association between toxicant exposure and neurobehavioral impairment. In vitro methods give much needed high throughput for many chemicals and mixtures but cannot provide information about toxicant impacts on behavioral function. Crucial to the utility of experimental animal model studies is cross-species translation. This is vital for both risk assessment and mechanistic determination. Interspecies extrapolation is important to characterize from experimental animal models to humans and between different experimental animal models. This article reviews the literature concerning extrapolation of neurobehavioral toxicology from established rat models to humans and from zebrafish a newer experimental model to rats. The functions covered include locomotor activity, emotion, and cognition and the neurotoxicants covered include pesticides, metals, drugs of abuse, flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. With more complete understanding of the strengths and limitations of interspecies translation, we can better use animal models to protect humans from neurobehavioral toxicity.

TI  - Occurrence and removal of chemicals of emerging concern in wastewater treatment plants and their impact on receiving water systems.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered the main sources of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic environments, and can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. In this study, WWTP influent, effluent, and sludge, and upstream and downstream waters from the WWTP recipient were investigated at 15 locations for a total of 164 CECs, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and pesticides. In addition, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo toxicity tests (ZFET) were applied to WWTP influent and effluent, and upstream and downstream waters from WWTP recipients. A total of 119 CECs were detected in at least one sample, mean concentrations ranging from 0.11 ng/L (propylparaben) to 64,000 ng/L (caffeine), in wastewater samples and from 0.44 ng/L (ciprofloxacin) to 19,000 ng/L (metformin) in surface water samples. Large variations of CEC concentrations were found between the selected WWTPs, which can be explained by differences in CEC composition in influent water and WWTP treatment process. The sludge-water partitioning coefficient (K(d)) of CECs showed a significant linear correlation to octanol/water partition coefficient (K(OW)) (p \textless 0.001), and thus could be used for predicting their fate in the aqueous and solid phase. The ΣCEC concentrations in WWTPs declined by on average 60%, based on comparisons of WWTP influent and effluent concentrations. The high concentrations of CECs in WWTP effluent resulted in, on average, 50% higher concentrations of CECs in water downstream of WWTPs compared with upstream. Some WWTP samples showed toxicity in ZFET compared with the respective control group, but no individual CECs or groups of CECs could explain this toxicity. These results could provide a theoretical basis for optimization of existing treatment systems of different designs, and could significantly contribute to protecting recipient waters.

TI  - Dynamic and reversible fluorescence imaging of superoxide anion fluctuations in live cells and in vivo.
T2  - Journal of the American Chemical Society
AB  - Overgeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is closely associated with cellular damage and diseases. As superoxide anion (O2(•-)) is the precursor of other ROS, exploring O2(•-) fluctuations in cells and in vivo is of great significance. To address this critical need, we have developed a novel reversible fluorescent probe with one-photon and two-photon fluorescence properties, which is well suited for monitoring O2(•-) fluxes selectively and dynamically. Imaging results substantiate dynamic and reversible fluorescence responses of this probe to intracellular O2(•-) under apoptotic stimuli. Moreover, this probe can conveniently visualize changes in O2(•-) concentration during reperfusion injury in hepatocytes, zebrafish, and mice, by means of one-photon or two-photon imaging according to depths of various samples. The present study provides a powerful fluorescent imaging tool for dynamic tracking of O2(•-) in live cells and in vivo.

TI  - Electrospun Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) Templated 2D Nanofibrous Mats: A Platform toward Practical Applications for Dye Removal and Bacterial Disinfection.
T2  - ACS omega
AB  - The fabrication of polymeric nanofibers and its potential versatility instigated to foster smart hybrid nanomaterials for the removal of environmental pollutants. In this pursuit, in this research work, polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based two-dimensional (2D) nanofibrous mats with polyethyleneimine (PEI)/Fe and quaternary ammonium (QA)/Fe as hybrid fillers were prepared by the electrospinning process for the effective dye removal and bacterial disinfection. The characteristics of the fabricated nanomaterials were extensively explored by several analytical techniques such as field emission-scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. Magnetic and thermal properties were investigated by superconducting quantum interference device and thermogravimetric measurements. The kinetic and isothermal models affirmed the adsorption behavior of the PAN-PEI/Fe nanofibers, and further regenerative studies substantiated the sustainability of the mats for the removal of industrial dye effluents. Subsequently, the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofiber mats exhibited bactericidal killing efficacy of 99 and 89.5% in both Staphylococcus aureus and green fluorescence protein expressing Escherichia coli bacterial models evaluated from the conventional quantitative bacterial colony-counting assay. Disk diffusion method and microscopic investigations corroborated the disinfection efficacy with zone of inhibitions of ∼23 and 33 mm, respectively. Interestingly, in vitro cell culture studies conducted in BHK-21 and NIH 3T3 cell lines demonstrated the cytocompatibility, and the in vivo toxicity investigations using the zebrafish models necessitated the real-time application of these nanofibrous mats. Therefore, the comprehensive study of the fabricated PAN-templated functionalized 2D nanofibrous mats affirmed to be competent for the remediation of industrial dye effluents and bacteria in water bodies.

TI  - Citric Acid-Mediated Microwave-Hydrothermal Synthesis of Mesoporous F-Doped HAp Nanorods from Bio-Waste for Biocidal Implant Applications.
T2  - Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - In this current research, mesoporous nano-hydroxyapatite (HAp) and F-doped hydroxyapatite (FHAp) were effectively obtained through a citric acid-enabled microwave hydrothermal approach. Citric acid was used as a chelating and modifying agent for tuning the structure and porosity of the HAp structure. This is the first report to use citric acid as a modifier for producing mesoporous nano HAp and F-doped FHAp. The obtained samples were characterized by different analyses. The XRD data revealed that F is incorporated well into the HAp crystal structure. The crystallinity of HAp samples was improved and the unit cell volume was lowered with fluorine incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the obtained samples revealed that a nano rod-like shape was obtained. The mesoporous structures of the produced HAp samples were confirmed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. In vivo studies performed using zebrafish and C. elegans prove the non-toxic behavior of the synthesized F doped HAp samples. The obtained samples are also analyzed for antimicrobial activity using Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which are majorly involved in implant failure. The F doped samples revealed excellent bactericidal activity. Hence, this study confirms that the non-toxic and excellent antibacterial mesoporous F doped HAp can be a useful candidate for biocidal implant application.

TI  - The interaction of genetics and environmental toxicants in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: results from animal models.
T2  - Neural regeneration research
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive death of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and eventual death. There is presently no cure for ALS, and only two drugs are available, neither of which provide significant extension of life. The wide variation in onset and progression of the disease, both in sporadic and even in strongly penetrant monogenic familial forms of ALS, indicate that in addition to background genetic variation impacting the disease process, environmental exposures are likely contributors. Epidemiological evidence worldwide implicates exposures to bacterial toxins, heavy metals, pesticides, and trauma as probable environmental factors. Here, we review current advances in gene-environment interactions in ALS animal models. We report our recent discoveries in a zebrafish model of ALS in relation to exposure to the cyanobacterial toxin BMAA, and discuss several results from mouse models that show interactions with exposure to mercury and statin drugs, both leading to acceleration of the disease process. The increasing research into this combinatorial gene-environment process is just starting, but shows early promise to uncover the underlying biochemical pathways that instigate the initial motor neuron defects and lead to their rapidly progressive dysfunction.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Mucor circinelloides SCYA25 strain that we previously reported can effectively degrade the toxicity of JCC, and the newly screened Bacillus megaterium SCYA10 and Geotrichum candidum SCYA23 strains were used to detoxify JCC. Different solid-state-fermentation (SSF) parameters were optimized by single-factor tests and response surface methodology. A detoxification rate established by zebrafish toxicity of JCC at 96% was achieved under the following optimized conditions: the combination ratio of B. megaterium SCYA10, G. candidum SCYA23 and M. circinelloides SCYA25 at 2:3:1, a total injection amount of 15.25%, a feed to water ratio of 1:0.68, a fermentation temperature of 30.3°C and fermentation duration of 21.5 days. The protein content of fermented JCC (FJCC) increased, while the concentrations of ether extract, crude fibre and toxins were all degraded considerably. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the fermentation increased the contents of neurotransmitter receptor modulator, emulsifier, aromatic substances and insecticidal compounds, as well as decreasing the contents of oxidative stress and neurotoxic substances. A rat feeding trial showed that the growth performance of the rats provided with the FJCC diet was similar to that of the corn-soybean meal group, and no lesions in the liver and kidney were observed. CONCLUSION: The co-bio-fermentation process can effectively detoxify JCC and improve its nutritional value, which means it could be served as a protein feed in animal husbandry. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of three microbial strains can detoxify JCC in a safe and effective manner to provide a great potential alternative to soybean meal. The research also suggests that metabonomics and bioinformatics are useful tools for revealing the bio-detoxification mechanism.

TI  - Effects of spinetoram on the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity of zebrafish.
T2  - Fish & shellfish immunology
AB  - Our study investigated the effects of spinetoram on the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity of zebrafish. 10 h post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to several concentrations of spinetoram (0, 5.0 mg/L, 7.5 mg/L, 10 mg/L) for up to 96 hpf, and their mortality, heart rate, number of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative stress, apoptosis and gene expression were detected. Studies indicated that the spinetoram exposed zebrafish embryos showed yolk sac edema, slow growth, decreased heart rate, decreased number of immune cells, delayed thymic development and cell apoptosis. In addition, there were also significant changes in oxidative stress related indicators in zebrafish, the content of ROS and MDA and the activity of CAT and SOD increased with the increase of spinetoram concentration. Moreover, we detected the expression of TLR4 related genes including TLR4, MYD88 and NF-κB p65 which were significantly up-regulated in the treated groups. Meanwhile, we also found that pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and CXCL-c1c were up-regulated, but anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was down-regulated in the treated groups. Briefly, our results show that spinetoram induces the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity of zebrafish to a certain extent, providing basis for the further research on the molecular mechanism of spinetoram exposure to aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Single and joint toxicity assessment of four currently used pesticides to zebrafish (Danio rerio) using traditional and molecular endpoints.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Pesticides usually present in mixtures in surface waters, although they are traditionally regulated on an individual basis in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we aimed to investigate the lethal and transcriptional responses of individual and combined pesticides (iprodione, pyrimethanil, pyraclostrobin and acetamiprid) on zebrafish (Danio rerio). Semi-static toxicity test indicated that the greatest toxicity to the four life stages (embryonic, larval, juvenile and adult stages) of D. rerio was detected from pyraclostrobin, followed by iprodione and pyrimethanil. In contrast, the lowest toxicity to the organisms was found from acetamiprid. Most of the selected pesticides exerted greater toxicities to D. rerio of embryonic stage compared with other life stages. Synergistic responses were observed from all binary mixtures of iprodione in combination with pyrimethanil or acetamiprid and ternary mixtures of iprodione+pyraclostrobin in combination with pyrimethanil or acetamiprid. The expressions of 16 genes related to cell apoptosis pathway, oxidative stress response, innate immunity and endocrine disruption at the mRNA level showed that zebrafish embryos were affected by the individual or combined pesticides. The expressions of P53, Tnf, TRβ, Tsh and Cyp19a exhibited greater changes upon exposure to combined pesticides compared with individual pesticides. Taken together, increased toxicity might be triggered by the simultaneous presence of several pesticides in the aquatic environment, which seriously damaged the non-target organisms.

TI  - Toxicity of clomazone and its formulations to zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio).
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Herbicides are the most widely used group of pesticides but after reaching water bodies they are able to cause adverse effects on non-target organisms. Different formulations using the same active ingredient are frequently available, which raises the issue of potential influence of different formulation types on herbicide toxicity. The present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampa(®) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the way of active substance release. This investigation is the first report on zebrafish embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The technical active ingredient and formulations caused mortality and diverse teratogenic effects, showing different levels of toxicity. The LC(50) values for the technical ingredient, Rampa(®) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS were 61.4, 9.6 and 92.5mg a.i./l, respectively. Spontaneous movements in 22 hpf embryos decreased under exposure to both the technical ingredient and formulations. A significant number of underdeveloped embryos was detected after exposure to clomazone and Rampa(®) EC, while no underdevelopment was noted in embryos exposed to GAT Cenit 36 CS. Exposure to the technical ingredient and formulations led also to a series of morphological changes and interfered with the growth of zebrafish embryos. The EC(50) based on detection of edemas, spine and tail tip deformations and gas bladder absence (120hpf) was 12.1, 10.1 and 24.1mg/l for technical clomazone, Rampa(®) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, while teratogenicity index (TI) based on LC(50)/EC(50) ratio was 5.1, 1 and 3.8, respectively. The data in this study showed that the emulsifiable concentrate formulation (Rampa(®) EC) caused statistically significantly higher toxicity, and the aqueous capsule suspension (GAT Cenit 36 CS) lower toxicity than technical clomazone. It indicates that different formulations with the same active ingredient may have different environmental impacts, which is why risk assessment based only on active ingredient toxicity might not be sufficient in terms of preventing formulation effects on the environment.

TI  - Multiple toxicity of propineb in developing zebrafish embryos: Neurotoxicity, vascular toxicity, and notochord defects in normal vertebrate development.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - A dithiocarbamate (DTC) fungicide, propineb, affects thyroid function and exerts immunotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in humans. Long-term exposure to propineb is associated with carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, malfunction of the reproductive system, and abnormalities in vital signs during organ development. However, there is no evidence of acute toxicity attributable to propineb in zebrafish. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the toxicity of propineb in zebrafish by studying its adverse effects on embryo development, angiogenesis, and notochord development. Embryos with propineb exposure developed morphological and physiological defects and in larvae, apoptosis and notochord defects were induced in the early development stage. Transgenic fli1:eGFP zebrafish exposed to propineb showed abnormal larval development with defects in angiogenesis and deformed vasculature. Propineb induced irreversible damage to the neural development of embryos and neurogenic defects in developing zebrafish in transgenic olig2:dsRED zebrafish. These results show that exposure to propineb triggers abnormalities in different organ systems of zebrafish and suggests the physiological complexity of the response to propineb.

TI  - Characterization of boscalid-induced oxidative stress and neurodevelopmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Boscalid is a widely used fungicide in agriculture and has been frequently detected in both environments and agricultural products. However, evidence on the neurotoxic effect of boscalid is scarce. In this study, zebrafish served as an animal model to investigate the toxic effects and mechanisms of boscalid on aquatic vertebrates or higher animals. And we unravelled that boscalid induced developmental defects associated with oxidative stress. Developmental defects, including head deformity, hypopigmentation, decreased number of newborn neurons, structural defects around the ventricle, enlarged intercellular space in the brain, and nuclear concentration, were observed in zebrafish embryos after boscalid exposure at 48 hpf. Interestingly, we found that boscalid might directly induce oxidative stress and alter the activity of ATPase, which in turn disrupted the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and transmitter-transmitting signalings and melanocyte differentiation and melanin synthesis signalings. Ultimately, the differentiation of nerve cells and melanocytes were both impacted and the synthesis of melanin was inhibited, leading to morphological abnormalities. Additionally, exposure to boscalid led to less and imbalance motion and altered tendency of locomotor in larval fish. Collectively, our results provide new evidences for a comprehensive assessment of its toxicity and a warning for its residues in environment and agricultural products.

TI  - Toxicity and metabolomics study of isocarbophos in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Although isocarbophos is a widely used insecticide, its toxicity to aquatic organisms has not been well characterized. In this study, zebrafish were exposed to isocarbophos at concentrations of 50 µg L(-1) and 200 µg L(-1) to assess its bioaccumulation, metabolic disruption, and oxidative stress. Metabolomics analysis based on (1)H NMR spectroscopy showed that 50 µg L(-1) and 200 µg L(-1) isocarbophos exposure induced increases in leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alanine compared to levels in the control. Lactate, creatine, and taurine were reduced in the 50 µg L(-1) isocarbophos exposure group, and only lactate decreased in response to 200 µg L(-1) isocarbophos. After zebrafish were exposed to 50 and 200 µg L(-1) isocarbophos for 28 days, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) and GSH contents decreased significantly in the liver. This result indicates that there was significant oxidative stress in the liver. Furthermore, changes in metabolite profiles significantly covaried with changes in several oxidative stress endpoints based on partial least squares regression. These results will contribute to the environmental risk assessment of isocarbophos and clarify the mechanism underlying its toxicity in zebrafish.

TI  - Exposure to prothioconazole induces developmental toxicity and cardiovascular effects on zebrafish embryo.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Prothioconazole is a fungicide that has been widely used in general agriculture and livestock husbandry. This study evaluated the acute toxicity of prothioconazole to zebrafish embryos by assessing their hatching rate and malformation when exposed to different concentrations of prothioconazole. The 96 h-LC(50) value of zebrafish embryos was 1.70 mg/L. Upon exposure to 0.85 mg/L, the mortality rate of the embryos significantly increased while their hatching rate decreased significantly. At prothioconazole concentrations higher than 0.43 mg/L, developmental morphologic abnormalities such as heart and yolk-sac edema, spine curvature, tail deformity, shortened body length and decreased eye area were observed. The heart rate of embryos decreased in a dose-dependent fashion during the exposure time. Prothioconazole exposure also resulted in increased rates of cardiac malformation detected by significant increase in the distance between the sinus venosus and bulbus arteriosus and the pericardium area. Moreover, the expression levels of genes related to cardiac development (amhc, vmhc, fli1, hand2, gata4, nkx2.5, tbx5 and atp2a2a) were significantly altered after exposure to prothioconazole. Indeed, this study revealed the adverse effects on the developmental and cardiovascular system of zebrafish embryo caused by prothioconazole. It further elucidated the risk of prothioconazole exposure to vertebrate cardiovascular toxicity. As such, it provides a theoretical foundation for pesticide risk management measures.

TI  - Acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant effects of fluralaner in zebrafish, Danio rerio.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Fluralaner is a novel isoxazoline insecticide which shows high insecticidal activity against parasitic, sanitary and agricultural pests, but there is little information about the effect of fluralaner on non-target organisms. This study reports the acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant response of fluralaner in zebrafish. All LC(50) values of fluralaner to zebrafish were higher than 10 mg L(-1) at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1)) for 15 d and then held 6 d in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06 (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1) fluralaner, respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113 mg kg(-1) was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After exposure in 2.00 mg L(-1) fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST, GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L(-1) of fluralaner. Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure periods. Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO(®)) are of low toxicity to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved in the fluralaner-induced toxicity. Among them, the activities of CAT and CarE, and most mRNA expression level of CYPs showed fast response to the sub-lethal concentration of fluralaner, which could be used as a biomarker relevant to the toxicity.

TI  - Effects of metals on enantioselective toxicity and biotransformation of cis-bifenthrin in zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Co-occurrence of pyrethroids and metals in watersheds previously has been reported to pose great risk to aquatic species. Pyrethroids are a class of chiral insecticides that have been shown to have enantioselective toxicity and biotransformation. However, the influence of metals on enantioselectivity of pyrethroids has not yet been evaluated. In the present study, the effects of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) on the enantioselective toxicity and metabolism of cis-bifenthrin (cis-BF) were investigated in zebrafish at environmentally relevant concentrations. The addition of Cd, Cu, or Pb significantly increased the mortality of zebrafish in racemate and R-enantiomer of cis-BF-treated groups. In rac-cis-BF- or 1R-cis-BF-treated groups, the addition of Cd, Cu, or Pb caused a decrease in enantiomeric fraction (EF) and an increased ratio of R-enantiomer residues in zebrafish. In 1S-cis-BF-treated groups, coexposure to Cd led to a lower EF and decreased residue levels of S-enantiomer. In addition, coexposure to the 3 metals resulted in different biodegradation characteristics of each enantiomer accompanied with differential changes in the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1, CYP2, and CYP3 genes, which might be responsible for the enantioselective biodegradation of cis-BF in zebrafish. These results suggest that the influence of coexistent metals should be considered in the ecological risk assessment of chiral pyrethroids in aquatic environments.

TI  - Acute and short-term developmental toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl to zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - Cyhalofop-butyl is an aryloxyphenoxypropionate post-emergence herbicide widely used around the world in agriculture. The acute toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl to embryos, larvae (12 and 72 h post-hatching), and adult zebrafish, as well as the short-term developmental toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl to embryo and sac-fry stages, was tested. The results showed that the 96-h LC50 values of cyhalofop-butyl to embryos, 12 h post-hatching larvae, 72 h post-hatching larvae, and adult fish were 2.03, 0.58, 1.42, and 3.49 mg/L, respectively, suggesting zebrafish early life stages were more sensitive to cyhalofop-butyl than adult stage. Cyhalofop-butyl would inhibit the spontaneous movement, heartbeat, hatching rate of embryos, and the body length of surviving larvae of zebrafish at 1.00 mg/L or higher concentrations. Morphological abnormalities, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, deformation of tail, and deformation of spine, were induced by cyhalofop-butyl. The results indicated that cyhalofop-butyl had significant negative impacts on zebrafish at different life stages, and spontaneous movement and hatching rate were sensitive endpoints for assessing short-term developmental toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of chlorpropham induces pathological changes and vascular irregularities in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Chlorpropham is used to prevent sprouting in stored agricultural products. It functions through mitosis inhibition or microtubule assembly inhibition in target organisms including plants, protozoa, and fungi. Although the toxicity ranges of chlorpropham in different organisms are known, specific studies on the environmental contamination and the harmful effects of chlorpropham has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that toxicity assays of chlorpropham using zebrafish embryos showed pathological morphology alteration with half the embryos undergoing embryonic death. Fluorescent dye was used in live embryos to identify whether oxidative stress and apoptosis mediated developmental malformation. Specific genes related to apoptosis, ccnd1, ccne1, and cdk6, belonging to cell cycle regulation were downregulated on exposure to sublethal concentrations of chlorpropham. Moreover, vascular morphogenesis, which contributes to the cardiovascular circulatory system, was disrupted by chlorpropham along with decreased expression of specific regulators (flt1, kdr, and vegfaa). These data suggest that environmentally preserved chlorpropham is a potential pollutant in non-target species, especially in aquatic organisms, and emphasizes the need for caution regarding the ecotoxicity of chlorpropham.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyrimorph is a novel fungicide being developed in China that shows high antifungal activity against diseases caused by Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora capsici, Rhizoctonia solani, Peronophythora litchi and Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Until now, no information on the toxicity of pyrimorph to untargeted organisms has been reported. To assess the potential environmental impacts of pyrimorph in fish, the acute toxicity and bioconcentration of pyrimorph in zebrafish were studied in this paper. RESULTS: When tested by the semi-static method, the 48, 72 and 96 h median lethal concentration (LC50 ) values of pyrimorph to zebrafish were 24.33, 22.61 and 19.79 mg L(-1) respectively. To study the bioconcentration of pyrimorph in zebrafish, the fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of pyrimorph (2.00 and 0.25 mg L(-1) ) for 192 h, a modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method was applied to extract pyrimorph from samples and the residues of pyrimorph in the water and fish were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The highest bioconcentration factor (BCF) of pyrimorph in the fish was 1.07 × 10(2) (144 h) and 23.1 (96 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.25 mg L(-1) of pyrimorph respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The novel fungicide pyrimorph has low toxicity to zebrafish; however, it showed medium BCF to zebrafish. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the residue of pyrimorph in fish, as well as to its long-term ecological effects.

TI  - Developmental toxicity and inhibition of the fungicide hymexazol to melanin biosynthesis in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Pesticide biochemistry and physiology
AB  - Hymexazol is an efficacious and widely used fungicide. However, its environmental toxicological assessment has not been well documented. It had no report of its toxicity to fish embryo. Fish embryo acute toxicity tests are highly predictive of aquatic embryotoxicity outcome. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to hymexazol at varying concentrations for the study of the developmental toxicity, melanin biosynthesis, biochemical and transcriptional endpoints. The embryotoxicity tests indicated that the 96h LC(50) value of hymexazol was 649mg/L with a 95% confidence interval range of 632-667mg/L. Hymexazol at concentrations of 417-738mg/L decreased the heart rate and increased the voluntary swing. Hymexazol inhibited normal development at concentrations above 554mg/L. the 96h EC(50) was 411mg/L. Hymexazol in a concentration range of 417-738mg/L induced cardiac edema and yolk sac edema. Exposure of hymexazol at such concentrations to zebrafish embryos for 48h decreased the pigment area density compared with the no hymexazol control. Tyrosinase activity was inhibited by hymexazol relative to the untreated control. The P53 mRNA expression level in embryos upon exposure to 480mg/L or greater of hymexazol was significantly higher than that of the control. The results indicated that hymexazol has quite low acute toxicity and low embryotoxicity to zebrafish.

TI  - Target and Nontarget Toxicity of Cassia fistula Fruit Extract Against Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae), Lung Cells (BEAS-2B) and Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Embryos.
T2  - Journal of medical entomology
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious diseases, which threaten humans and severely affect livestock. The half-lethal concentration (LC50) was calculated by log probit analysis. The LC50 and LC90 values of larvicidal activity of Cassia fistula Linn. hexane-methanol soluble fraction (HMSF) after 24 h of exposure were 21.04 and 34.68 µg/ml, respectively. The LC50 values after 24 h of exposure were 84.09 µg/ml and 108.08 µg/ml for chloroform-methanol soluble fraction (CMSF) and ethyl acetate-methanol soluble fraction (EMSF) respectively. The percent hatchability of eggs exposed to the hexane extract was 90 ± 5.0, 68.33 ± 7.6, 46.6 ± 11.5, 10 ± 0.0, and 0 ± 0.0% at 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 ppm, respectively. The pupicidal activity of the hexane extract at 40 µg/ml was 0.0%. The LC50 value of adulticidal activity of the hexane extract was 12.8 mg/test tube. The biosafety of the hexane extract was assessed in nontarget organisms, i.e., zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and normal lung cells (BEAS-2B). The hexane extract of C. fistula was well tolerated by zebrafish embryos, and no mortality or toxicity was found in the embryos exposed to the highest tested concentration of 300 µg/ml. Similarly, all the concentrations tested against the normal lung cells (BEAS-2B) showed more than 95% survival. The gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis identified 12 compounds, and 2-methyl hexanoic acid and 2-methyl butanoic acid were the major compounds identified in the hexane extract. The larvicidal activity of C. fistula extracts will help in the development of natural substitutes for vector management of mosquito populations.

TI  - Evaluation of interactive effects of UV light and nano encapsulation on the toxicity of azoxystrobin on zebrafish.
T2  - Nanotoxicology
AB  - The use of nanotechnology to enhance pesticide formulations holds the promise of reduced pesticide use, reduced mobility in soils, and overall improvements in agricultural practices while simultaneously maintaining yields. However, the toxicity of nano-enabled pesticides, including azoxystrobin (Az), has not been well studied compared with their conventional form. This study investigates both lethal and sub-lethal endpoints in zebrafish embryos up to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf) under either laboratory light or simulated UV light. The median lethal concentration (LC50) value of nano-enabled Az (nAz) was significantly lower than the conventional form (Az). Interestingly, artificial UV light significantly increased toxicity (decreased LC50) of both Az and nAz. Malformations were not observed but the remaining yolk sac volume was significantly increased in both types of Az at both light conditions. This decreased yolk consumption is in agreement with reduced oxygen consumption and heart rate. Catalase enzyme activity was only reduced to UV light while superoxide dismutase activity was significantly reduced by co-exposure of UV light, and either type of Az at a nominal concentration of 100 μg L(-1). The co-exposure of Az at 100 μg L(-1) and UV light significantly upregulated sod1, sod2, and gpx1b expression and both types of Az significantly reduced gpx1a expression. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in nAz and Az at 100 μg L(-1) under laboratory light, while UV light induced even higher level of lipid peroxidation. The results will provide important information on the toxicity of nAz under ecologically realistic conditions.

TI  - Enzymatic activity and gene expression changes in zebrafish embryos and larvae exposed to pesticides diazinon and diuron.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - The zebrafish as a test organism enables the investigation of effects on a wide range of biological levels from molecular level to the whole-organism level. The use of fish embryos represents an attractive model for studies aimed at understanding toxic mechanisms and the environmental risk assessment of chemicals. In the present study, a zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo model was employed in order to assess the effects of two commonly used pesticides, the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron, on zebrafish early life stages. Since it was previously established that diazinon and diuron cause effects at the whole-organism level, this study assessed the suborganismic responses to exposure to these pesticides and the enzymatic responses (biochemical level) and the gene expression changes (molecular level) were analyzed. Different exposure scenarios were employed and the following endpoints measured: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities; and gene expressions of the corresponding genes: acetylcholinesterase (ache), carboxylesterase (ces2), cytochrome P450 (cyp1a), glutathione-S-transferase (gstp1), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx1a) and additionally glutathione reductase (gsr). Significant changes at both the biochemical and the molecular level were detected. In addition, different sensitivities of different developmental stages of zebrafish were determined and partial recovery of the enzyme activity 48h after the end of the exposure was observed. The observed disparity between gene expression changes and alterations in enzyme activities points to the necessity of monitoring changes at different levels of biological organization. Different exposure scenarios, together with a comparison of the responses at the biochemical and molecular level, provide valuable data on the effects of diazinon and diuron on low organizational levels in zebrafish embryos and larvae.

TI  - Toxicity induced by glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides in the zebrafish hepatocyte cell line (ZF-L).
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Glyphosate is the active component of many commonly used herbicides; it can reach bodies of water through irrigated rice plantations. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of glyphosate and Roundup(®) (a glyphosate-based herbicide) in established culture of the zebrafish hepatocyte cell line ZF-L after 24 and 48 h of exposure to concentrations of 650 and 3250 µg/L. We observed a reduction in metabolic activity and lysosomal integrity, and an increase in cell number after 24 h of Roundup(®) exposure at the highest concentration. An increase in active mitochondria and apoptotic cells was observed following 24 h exposure to glyphosate and Roundup(®), while only exposure to Roundup(®) induced an increase in necrotic cells. Rhodamine B accumulation decreased after 48 h exposure to 650 µg/L of Roundup(®); this reduction is indicative of increased activity of ABC pumps. Overall, the present findings highlighted the hazard of glyphosate exposure not only in the commercial formulation but also glyphosate alone, since both can induce damage in the ZF-L cell line primarily through the induction of apoptosis.

TI  - The identification of the metabolites of chlorothalonil in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and their embryo toxicity and endocrine effects at environmentally relevant levels.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Chlorothalonil is a broad spectrum fungicide with high annual production and environmental contamination. Despite its high consumption, studies regarding the potential ecological risks of chlorothalonil, especially its metabolites, to aquatic organisms are still limited. In this study, we selected the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as the in vivo model and first identified the metabolite (4-hydroxychlorothalonil) of chlorothalonil in zebrafish by tandem quadrupole/orthogonal-acceleration time-of-flight (Q-TOF). Then, the in vivo and in vitro models were applied to comprehensively estimate the embryo toxicity and potential endocrine effect of chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil. The data from zebrafish embryo toxicity showed that the lowest observed effect concentrations of both chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil were 50 μg/L after 96 h of exposure. The mortality rate of the 4-hydroxychlorothalonil was 2.6-fold higher than that of the parent compound at the concentration of 50 μg/L. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that both chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil exerted estrogen receptor α (ERα) agonist activity with REC(20) values of 2.4 × 10(-8) M and 3.6 × 10(-8) M, respectively. However, only 4-hydroxychlorothalonil exhibited both thyroid receptor β (TRβ) agonistic and antagonistic activities. Lastly, we employed molecular docking to predict the binding affinity of chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil with ERα or TRβ. The results revealed that the potential endocrine effect of chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothaloni might be attributed to the different binding affinities with the receptors. In conclusion, our studies revealed that 4-hydroxychlorothalonil exhibited potent endocrine-disrupting effects compared to its parent compound, chlorothalonil. The results provided here remind us that the assessment of the potential ecological and health risks of the metabolites of fungicides in addition to their parent compounds should arouse great concerns.

T2  - Journal of applied toxicology : JAT
AB  - Organochlorine pesticides and brominated flame retardants, such as tetrabromobisphenol A and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pose an environmental hazard owing to their persistence, low solubility and estrogenic effects, and concerns have been raised regarding their effects on aquatic biota. In the present study, zebrafish embryos and larvae were used as a model to investigate the sublethal and lethal effects of three different organochlorine pesticides, namely methoxychlor, endosulfan and heptachlor, as well as the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A, and its precursor compound bisphenol A. Preliminary data for chemical exposure tests were obtained by determining the 96 h median effective concentration EC50 (hatching rate) and 96 h median lethal concentration LC50 . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the gene expression levels of the biomarker vitellogenin (vtg1) after 96 h exposures to 10, 25, 50 and 75% of the 96 h EC50 value for embryos and 96 h LC50 value for larvae. The use of vtg1 mRNA induction in zebrafish embryos and larvae was found to be a sensitive biomarker of exposure to these organic compounds, and was helpful in elucidating their adverse effects and setting water quality guidelines.

TI  - Malachite green toxicity and effects on reproductive success in zebrafish Danio rerio.
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - Malachite green (MG) is frequently used to treat fish pathogens in zebrafish, but little is known about how MG may affect the physiological processes that are targets of research investigations. This study evaluated the effects of MG on reproductive success in zebrafish, Danio rerio, and the relative toxicity of MG oxalate and MG chloride salts. After 5-day exposure to a prophylactic concentration (0.065 mg/L) of MG oxalate, the percentage of spawning pairs significantly declined (57.5%±8.5 SE) and then returned to pre-exposure levels (89%±6.6 SE) within one week. Embryo and larval survival were not affected by exposure of parents to MG; however, when exposed directly, MG oxalate was more toxic than MG chloride in both life stages. The LC(50) for embryos was 0.067 μM and 0.116 μM for MG oxalate and MG chloride, respectively, and the LC(50) for larvae, 0.057 μM and 0.103 μM, respectively. Other than a transient reduction in the number of fish that spawned, MG treatment of broodstock did not impact reproductive success, which indicates that MG can be used prophylactically with minimal effects on reproduction. Based on acute toxicity, MG chloride should be preferred over MG oxalate.

TI  - Bifenthrin induces developmental immunotoxicity and vascular malformation during zebrafish embryogenesis.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Bifenthrin is a synthesized pyrethroid insecticide which is frequently used in the farmland to eradicate insects. Bifenthrin mainly disrupts sodium ion channel inducing neurotoxicity in the target insects. It also exerts toxic effects such as hormone dysregulation, hepatotoxicity and immunotoxicity in other vertebrates. However, there is no evidence of the acute-toxicity associated embryogenesis and organogenesis of bifenthrin in zebrafish. Here we first demonstrated that bifenthrin induced acute-toxicity accompanying inflammatory response and physiological degradations resulting in loss of embryogenesis and vascular development in zebrafish embryos. We found that bifenthrin increased intestinal ROS accumulation and the inflammatory genes including tnfa, il6, il8 and ptgs2b, thereby increasing embryo mortality. Moreover, bifenthrin disrupted angiogenesis by down-regulation of VEGF receptors in embryos. Not only in the zebrafish, bifenthrin also decreased cell viability and hampered vascular formation of HUVECs. Collectively, bifenthrin induced developmental toxicity, inflammatory cell death and anti-angiogenesis during embryogenesis.

TI  - Bioaccumulation and Metabolism of Carbosulfan in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the Toxic Effects of Its Metabolites.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - Carbosulfan is a carbamate insecticide that has been widely used in agriculture. However, studies showed that carbosulfan could be highly toxic to aquatic organisms. The metabolism of carbosulfan in adult zebrafish is still largely unexplored, and the metabolites in individual or in combination may pose a potential threat to zebrafish. In the present study, the bioaccumulation and metabolism of carbosulfan in zebrafish (Danio rerio) were assessed, and the main metabolites, including carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran, were determined. The toxicity of carbosulfan and its metabolites individually or in combination to zebrafish was also investigated. The bioaccumulation and metabolism experiment indicated that carbosulfan was not highly accumulated in zebrafish, with a bioaccumulation factor of 18 after being exposed to carbosulfan for 15 days, and the metabolism was fast, with a half-life of 1.63 d. The two main metabolites were relatively persistent, with half-lives of 3.33 and 5.68 d for carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran, respectively. The acute toxicity assay showed that carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran had 96-h LC(50) values of 0.15 and 0.36 mg/L, showing them to be more toxic than carbosulfan (96-h LC(50) = 0.53 mg/L). Combinations of binary or ternary mixtures of carbosulfan and its metabolites displayed coincident synergistic effects on acute toxicity, with additive index (AI) values of 1.9-14.3. In the livers and gills of zebrafish exposed to carbosulfan, carbofuran, and 3-hydroxycarbofuran, activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase were significantly changed in most cases, and the content of malondialdehyde was greatly increased, indicating that carbosulfan and its metabolites induced varying degrees of oxidative stress. The metabolites were more persistent and toxic to zebrafish and exhibit coincident synergistic effects in combination. These results can provide evidence for the potential risk of pesticides and highlight the importance of a systematic assessment for the combination of the precursor and its metabolites.

T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - Global warming and indiscriminate usages of pesticides are notable concern to all. The present study has been conducted to evaluate the effects of high temperature on acute toxicity of sumithion in adult zebrafish. A 2-day renewal bioassay system was used to determine the 96 h LC(50) value of sumithion at three temperature regimes, such as 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C. Blood glucose (mg/dL) level was measured in control (0.0 mg/L) and low concentration (1.0 mg/L) of sumithion during the determination of LC(50) in three temperature conditions. In addition, micronucleus (MN), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), and erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA) tests were performed in the blood erythrocytes. The 96 h LC(50) value of sumithion for zebrafish was significantly lower at 35 °C, which indicates that the toxicity of sumithion increases at higher temperature. Blood glucose level was significantly increased by sumithion in all temperature conditions, while it was significantly higher in the highest (35 °C) temperature compared to the lowest (25 °C) temperature in both control and sumithion-treated fish. Similarly, frequencies of MN, ENA, and ECA were elevated by sumithion in all temperature conditions, whereas it was significantly raised in the highest (35 °C) temperature compared to the lowest (25 °C) temperature in both control and sumithion treated fish. With increasing temperature in exposure to sumithion, dissolved oxygen decreased significantly, whereas free CO(2) increased significantly. On the other hand, no distinct changes were observed in pH and total alkalinity during the experimental period. Therefore, it can be inferred that increasing temperature enhances the toxicity of sumithion in the zebrafish.

TI  - Famoxadone-cymoxanil induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Famoxadone-cymoxanil is a new protective and therapeutic fungicide, but little research has been done on it or its toxicity in aquatic organisms. In this study, we used zebrafish to investigate the cardiotoxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil and the potential mechanisms involved. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations of famoxadone-cymoxanil until 72 h post-fertilization (hpf), then changes of heart morphology in zebrafish embryos were observed. We also detected the levels of oxidative stress, myocardial-cell proliferation and apoptosis, ATPase activity, and the expression of genes related to the cardiac development and calcium-signaling pathway. After famoxadone-cymoxanil exposure, pericardial edema, cardiac linearization, and reductions in the heart rate and cardiac output positively correlated with concentration. Although myocardial-cell apoptosis was not detected, proliferation of the cells was severely reduced and ATPase activity significantly decreased, resulting in a severe deficiency in heart function. In addition, indicators of oxidative stress changed significantly after exposure of the embryos to the fungicide. To better understand the possible molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish, we studied the transcriptional levels of cardiac development, calcium-signaling pathways, and genes associated with myocardial contractility. The mRNA expression levels of key genes in heart development were significantly down-regulated, while the expression of genes related to the calcium-signaling pathway (ATPase [atp2a1], cardiac troponin C [tnnc1a], and calcium channel [cacna1a]) was significantly inhibited. Expression of klf2a, a major endocardial flow-responsive gene, was also significantly inhibited. Mechanistically, famoxadone-cymoxanil toxicity might be due to the downregulation of genes associated with the calcium-signaling pathway and cardiac muscle contraction. Our results found that famoxadone-cymoxanil exposure causes cardiac developmental toxicity and severe energy deficiency in zebrafish.

TI  - Combined effects of pentachlorophenol and its byproduct hexachlorobenzene on endocrine and reproduction in zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and its byproduct hexachlorobenze (HCB) are two co-existing persistent environmental chemicals, but their combined toxicity remains unclear. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to 5 (low dose) and 25 μg·L(-1) (high dose) of PCP, HCB or their combination for 21 days, and the impact on endocrine and reproduction was investigated. Results showed that combined exposure to 25 μg·L(-1) PCP and 25 μg· L(-1) HCB significantly increased the plasma estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) levels, altered the expressions of genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver (HPGL) axis, inhibited gonadal development, and eventually lead to decreased egg production of F0 zebrafish as well as inhibited development of F1 eggs/larvae. Compared to the combined exposure of high doses, significantly lower levels of plasma E2 and T were observed for either the high PCP or high HCB alone exposure, indicating a synergistic effect of the two chemicals on endocrine disruption after combination. Furthermore, the high PCP alone exposure inhibited the gonadal development in both the males and females, while the HCB alone exposure did not. Comparison of exposure effects indicated a greater decrease of mature gametes levels and egg production in the high combined group when compared to the high HCB alone group, but no significant difference was observed between the high combined group and the high PCP alone group. Taken together, the results suggested that combined exposure to PCP and HCB may synergistically affect endocrine of zebrafish, and result in reproduction impairments, with PCP being the primary contributor.

TI  - Developmental toxicity induced by Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - The current study evaluates the adverse effects of Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide (CNPE) on the early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The developmental toxicity was determined using different parameters such as mortality (including LC(50) ), hatching, heart rates, malformations, and alteration of the gene expressions. Zebrafish embryos (4 hpf-hours postfertilization) were exposed to 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 mg/l CNPE doses until 96 hpf. The 96 hours LC(50) was recorded at 6.258 mg/l. Seventy-two hpf total malformation index values for 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mg/l CNPE doses were 4.3, 7.2 and 7.9, respectively. 1.0 mg/l CNPE is not toxic for the zebrafish embryos/larvae. 2.0 to 8.0 CNPE doses caused some abnormalities in embryos/larvae morphology, including lack of body parts, tail deformities, chorda deformity, bubbled head, scoliosis, lordosis, weak or non-pigmentation, decreased heart rate and larva length. 16.0 mg/l CNPE caused mortality in 72 hpf. The expression levels of seven immune system-related genes (il-1β, il-8, cebp, tlr4, hsp70, NF-kB, and mtf-1) were examined. The transcription level of il-1β, il-8, tlr4, hsp70, and NF-kB genes significantly increased in the CNPE exposure groups. While the expression of the mtf-1 gene considerably decreased, the cebp gene expression level did not change in the 4.0 and 8.0 mg/l CNPE doses. In conclusion, CNPE could induce developmental toxicity with malformations in embryos/larvae and alter the gene expression.

TI  - Orbencarb induces lethality and organ malformation in zebrafish embryos during development.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Thiocarbamates are one of the components of pesticides that target weeds by inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Orbencarb, one of the isomeric thiocarbamates applied to wheat, maize, and soybean, has been found to have toxic effects on mammals and marine ecosystems. Although the toxicity ranges of orbencarb in different organisms are known, specific studies on the environmental contamination and harmful effects of orbencarb on non-target organisms are scarce. In this study, we observed that orbencarb induced embryotoxicity during zebrafish development as well as apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the intestine. It was further observed that orbencarb decreased the viability of the embryos and simultaneously affected the heart rate and vessel formation. Orbencarb decreased the mRNA levels of ccnd1, ccne1, cdk2, and cdk6 and induced abnormal development of the eyes, brain, yolk sac, and spinal cord in zebrafish embryos. Orbencarb also hampered vasculogenesis in the zebrafish embryos by inhibiting the mRNA expression of flt1, flt4, kdr, and vegfc. Collectively, these results suggested that orbencarb is embryotoxic and disrupts the normal growth of zebrafish embryos by inducing the generation of ROS and hampering vasculogenesis.

TI  - Stereoselective induction of developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity by acetochlor in the early life stage of zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Acetochlor (ACT) has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and implicated in disruption of the immune system in fish, the mechanisms of which, especially at enantiomeric levels, remains unclear. In the present study, embryonic zebrafish were exposed to ACT and its enantiomers at concentrations of 0, 2, 8, 15, 30 and 60 μM from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 72 hpf. We demonstrated that ACT and its enantiomers could cause time- and concentration-dependent mortality (72 h LC(50) ranged from 48.4 to 53.1 μM) and developmental malformations (e.g., 48 h EC(50) for yolk sac edema ranged from 36.7 to 54.1 μM), as well as increase transcription of the key genes involved in the innate immune system. A consistent enantioselectivity in these endpoints was observed with (-)-R-ACT showed stronger effects than (+)-S-ACT, and the transcription levels of il-1β exhibited significant enantioselectivity at concentrations as low as 8 μM. Further Western blot analysis revealed that significant elevations of Il-1β protein expression in all (-)-R-ACT treatment groups. According to the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, the enantioselectivity between ACT enantiomers was attributed to the distinct binding affinity to Il-1β. Overall, our in vivo and in silico studies uniquely disclosed the enantioselective immunotoxicity of ACT and its underlying mechanisms and highlighted the need to evaluate the environmental risk of chiral chloroacetamide herbicide in aquatic organisms at enantiomeric levels.

TI  - Exposure to diclofop-methyl induces cardiac developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Diclofop-methyl (DM) is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture production and has been frequently detected in both freshwater and environments, even agricultural products. However, the potential toxic effects of DM on organisms and the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we utilized zebrafish to evaluate the toxicity of DM during the cardiovascular developmental process. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25 mg/L DM induced cardiac defects, such as pericardial edema, slow heart rate and long SV-BA distance but the vascular development in zebrafish larvae was not influenced by DM treatment. The expression of cardiac-related genes were disordered and DM exposure initiated disordering cardiogenesis from the period of precardiac mesoderm formation. Moreover, the apoptosis and proliferation of cardiomyocytes were not influenced but the levels of oxidative stress were upregulated by DM exposure. Fullerenes and astaxanthin was able to rescue cardiac defects caused by DM via downregulating oxidative stress. Wnt signaling was downregulated after DM treatment and activation of Wnt signaling could rescue cardiac defects. Therefore, our results suggest that DM has the potential to induce cardiac developmental toxicity through upregulation of Wnt-Mediated (reactive oxygen species) ROS generation in zebrafish larvae.

TI  - Acute toxicity and sublethal effects of fipronil on detoxification enzymes in juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Pesticide biochemistry and physiology
AB  - The acute toxicity of fipronil and its sublethal effects on detoxification enzymes (carboxylesterases (CarEs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD)) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) were investigated. The results indicated that the 24-h LC50 of fipronil for zebrafish was 220.4 μg/L (95% CI: 173.7-272.4 μg/L). Sublethal concentrations of fipronil did not cause significant changes in CarEs activities. In the liver and muscle tissues, GST activities at the tested concentrations did not significantly differ from those in the control. In the brain and gill tissues, GST activities at a concentration of 4 μg/L were significantly lower than those at a concentration of 2 μg/L. The results suggest that CarEs and GSTs were not suitable biomarkers for fipronil effects in D. rerio. A significant induction in the ECOD activities in the brain, gill, liver, and muscle tissues was observed compared with the control. Moreover, the dose-dependent responses of the ECOD activity were observed after treatment with sublethal concentrations of fipronil in the range of 2-20 μg/L. The results suggested that ECOD could be a suitable biomarker of fipronil effects in D. rerio.

TI  - Cadmium potentiates toxicity of cypermethrin in zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Co-occurrence of pesticides such as synthetic pyrethroids and metals in aquatic ecosystems raises concerns over their combined ecological effects. Cypermethrin, 1 of the top 5 synthetic pyrethroids in use, has been extensively detected in surface water. Cadmium (Cd) has been recognized as 1 of the most toxic metals and is a common contaminant in the aquatic system. However, little information is available regarding their joint toxicity. In the present study, combined toxicity of cypermethrin and Cd and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Zebrafish embryos and adults were exposed to the individual contaminant or binary mixtures. Co-exposure to cypermethrin and Cd produced synergistic effects on the occurrence of crooked body, pericardial edema, and noninflation of swim bladder. The addition of Cd significantly potentiated cypermethrin-induced spasms and caused more oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae. Cypermethrin-mediated induction of transcription levels and catalytic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme were significantly down-regulated by Cd in both zebrafish larvae and adults. Chemical analytical data showed that in vitro elimination of cypermethrin by CYP1A1 was inhibited by Cd. The addition of Cd caused an elevation of in vivo cypermethrin residue levels in the mixture-exposed adult zebrafish. These results suggest that the enhanced toxicity of cypermethrin in the presence of Cd results from the inhibitory effects of Cd on CYP-mediated biotransformation of this pesticide. The authors' findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic basis accounting for the joint toxicity of cypermethrin and Cd.

TI  - Toxicity effects of captan on different life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and developmental effects of captan on different life stages (embryo and adult) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed that the 96-h lethal concentration 50 (LC(50)) values of embryo and adult zebrafish (exposed to captan) were 0.81(0.75-0.87) mg/L and 0.65(0.62-0.68) mg/L, respectively. The results of developmental effect experiment showed that captan can significantly decrease the heartbeats and inhibit the hatching rate and growth of zebrafish embryos. Moreover, captan exposure can induce a series of deformities, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, spine curvature, and tail bending, in zebrafish embryos during the developmental period. Among these, the most significant were tail bending and spine curvature.

TI  - Joint toxic effects of triazophos and imidacloprid on zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Pesticide contamination is more often found as a mixture of different pesticides in water bodies rather than individual compounds. However, regulatory risk evaluation is mostly based on the effects of individual pesticides. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the individual and joint toxicities of triazophos (TRI) and imidacloprid (IMI) to the zebrafish (Danio rerio) using acute indices and various sublethal endpoints. Results from 96-h semi-static test indicated that the LC(50) values of TRI to D. rerio at multiple life stages (embryonic, larval, juvenile and adult stages) ranged from 0.49 (0.36-0.71) to 4.99 (2.06-6.81) mg a.i. L(-1), which were higher than those of IMI ranging from 26.39 (19.04-38.01) to 128.9 (68.47-173.6) mg a.i. L(-1). Pesticide mixtures of TRI and IMI displayed synergistic response to zebrafish embryos. Activities of carboxylesterase (CarE) and catalase (CAT) were significantly changed in most of the individual and joint exposures of pesticides compared with the control group. The expressions of 26 genes related to oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, immune system, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at the mRNA level revealed that zebrafish embryos were affected by the individual or joint pesticides, and greater changes in the expressions of six genes (Mn-sod, CXCL-CIC, Dio1, Dio2, tsh and vtg1) were observed when exposed to joint pesticides compared with their individual pesticides. Taken together, the synergistic effects indicated that it was highly important to incorporate joint toxicity studies, especially at low concentrations, when assessing the risk of pesticides.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is widely used in agriculture as herbicide/pesticide, plant growth regulator and fruit preservative agent. It progressively accumulates in the environment including surface water, air and soil. It could be detected in human food and urine, which poses great risk to the living organisms. In the present study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of 2,4-D on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo. 2,4-D exposure significantly decreased both the survival rate (LC(50) = 46.71 mg/L) and hatching rate (IC(50) = 46.26 mg/L) of zebrafish embryos. The most common developmental defect in 2,4-D treated embryos was pericardial edema. 2,4-D (25 mg/L) upregulated marker genes of cardiac development (vmhc, amhc, hand2, vegf, and gata1) and downregulated marker genes of oxidative stress (cat and gpx1a). Whole mount in situ hybridization confirmed the vmhc and amhc upregulation by 2,4-D treatment. LC/MS/MS showed that the bioaccumulation of 2,4-D in zebrafish embryos were increased in a time-dependent manner after 25 mg/L of 2,4-D treatment. Taken together, our study investigated the toxic effects of 2,4-D on zebrafish embryonic development and its potential molecular mechanisms, gave evidence for the full understanding of 2,4-D toxicity on living organisms and shed light on its environmental impact.

TI  - Developmental Toxicity of a Neonicotinoid Insecticide, Acetamiprid to Zebrafish Embryos.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - Agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticides is increasing worldwide, posing a risk to nontarget organisms. The present study investigated developmental toxicity of a widely used neonicotinoid, acetamiprid, to zebrafish embryos. Sublethal (malformations, hatchability, heart rate, body length, alteration of spontaneous movement and touch responses) and lethal effects were monitored during exposure period from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. Zebrafish embryos exhibited significant mortality and teratogenic effects at acetamiprid concentration greater than 263 mg/L, with bent spine being the main malformation. Toxicity spectra were constructed to rank the sensitivity of individual end points to acetamiprid exposure and impaired spontaneous movement was the most sensitive end point of those tested. The present study provides the basis for understanding developmental toxicity of acetamiprid exposure to zebrafish embryos. This information is critical for future studies evaluating aquatic risk from neonicotinoids as little is known regarding adverse effects of neonicotinoids to aquatic vertebrate species.

TI  - Biological response of zebrafish after short-term exposure to azoxystrobin.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Azoxystrobin (AZ) is a broad-spectrum systemic fungicide that widely used in the world. The present study investigated the toxicity effects on zebrafish after short-term exposure of AZ. Results demonstrated that the larval stage was most susceptible to AZ in the multiple life stages of zebrafish, with 96 h-LC(50) value of 0.777 mg/L. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to different AZ concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μg/L) and examined on 24, 48 and 72 h. It was found that AZ induced ROS accumulation, increased GST, GPX and POD activity and the transcriptions of antioxidant and stress response related genes, while the opposite trend occurred for SOD and CAT activity in 24-h or 48-h exposure period. The increased E(2) and VTG levels in zebrafish larvae, and altered transcription levels of regulatory and steroidogenic genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis indicated the endocrine disruption capacity of AZ. The transcripts of mdm2, p53, ogg1, bcl2, bbc3, cas8 and cas9 involved in cell apoptosis, and the mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines such as cxcl-c1c, ccl, il-1β, il-8, ifn, and tnfα were in accordance with the trends of the examined genes involved in oxidative stress and endocrine system. The results suggested that short-term exposure to AZ might impose ecotoxicological effects on zebrafish larvae, and the information presented here also provide molecular strategies and increase mechanistic understanding of AZ-induced toxic response, and help elucidate the environmental risks of AZ.

TI  - Evaluation of joint effects of cyprodinil and kresoxim-methyl on zebrafish, Danio rerio.
T2  - Journal of hazardous materials
AB  - Aquatic organisms are usually exposed to a mixture of pesticides instead of individual chemicals. However, risk assessment of pesticides is traditionally based on toxicity data of individual compounds. In this study, we aimed to examine the joint toxicity of two fungicides cyprodinil (CYP) and kresoxim-methyl (KRM) to zebrafish (Danio rerio) using a systematic experimental approach. Results from 96-h semi-static test indicated that the LC(50) values of KRM to D. rerio at multiple life stages (embryonic, larval, juvenile and adult stages) ranged from 0.034 (0.015-0.073) to 0.61 (0.39-0.83) mg a.i. L(-1), which were higher than those of CYP ranging from 1.05 (0.88-1.52) to 4.42 (3.24-6.02) mg a.i. L(-1). Pesticide mixtures of CYP and KRM exhibited synergistic effect on embryonic zebrafish. The activities of carboxylesterase (CarE) and cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) were significantly altered in most of the individual and combined exposures compared with the control group. The expressions of seven genes (Mnsod, cyp17, crhr 2, crh, gnrhr 4, gnrhr 1 and hmgrb) were significantly altered upon exposure to combined pesticides compared with their individual pesticides. Collectively, these findings suggested joint effects should be considered in the risk assessment of pesticides and development of water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic environment.

TI  - Enantioselective separation and zebrafish embryo toxicity of insecticide beta-cypermethrin.
T2  - Journal of environmental sciences (China)
AB  - Enantioselectivity of chiral pollutants is receiving growing concern due to the difference in toxicology and environment fate between enantiomers. In this study, enantiomers of insecticide beta-cypermethrin (beta-CP) were separated on selected chiral column by HPLC, and the toxicity of enantiomers was evaluated using the zebrafish embryo-larval assays. The enantiomers of beta-CP were baseline separated on Chiralcel OD and Chiralpak AD columns and detected by circular dichroism (CD) at 236 nm. Better separation could be achieved at lower temperature (e.g., 20 degrees C) and with lower levels of polar modifiers. Pure enantiomers were obtained on Chiralcel OD. The CD spectra of enantiomers were recorded. By comparing the elution order with a previous similar study, the absolute configuration of beta-CP enantiomers was determined. The individual enantiomers were used in zebrafish embryo test, and the results showed that beta-CP enantioselectively induced yolk sac edema, pericardial edema and crooked body. The IR-cis-alphaS and 1R-trans-alphaS enantiomers showed strong developmental toxicities at concentration of 0.1 mg/L, while the 1S-cis-alphaR and 1S-trans-alphaR induced no malformations at higher concentration (e.g., 0.3 mg/L). The results suggest that the enantioselective toxicological effects of beta-CP should be considered when evaluating its ecotoxicological effects.

TI  - The synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin impairs zebrafish (Danio rerio) swim bladder development.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Deltamethrin (DM) is a widely used insecticide and reveals neural, cardiovascular and reproductive toxicity to various aquatic organisms. It has been known that DM negatively affects motion of zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, little is known in relation to the impacts of DM on development of swim bladder, which is a key organ for motion. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 20 and 40 µg/L DM. The changes of swim bladder morphology were observed and transcription levels of key genes were compared between DM treatments and the control. The results showed that DM treatments significantly blocked the formation of progenitor and tissue layers in swim bladder of zebrafish embryos, leading to failed inflation of swim bladder. Compared with the control, the key genes (pbx1, foxA3, mnx1, has2, anxa5b, hprt1l and elovl1a) responsible for swim bladder development also showed decreased levels in response to DM treatments, suggesting that DM might specifically affect swim bladder development. Moreover, transcription levels of genes in the Wnt (wnt5b, tcf3a, wnt1, wnt9b, fzd1, fzd3 and fzd5) and Hedgehog (ihhb, ptc1 and ptc2) signaling pathways all decreased significantly in response to DM treatments, compared with the control. Considering the importance of Wnt and Hedgehog pathways in development of swim bladder, these results suggested that DM might affect swim bladder development through inhibiting the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. Overall, the present study reported that swim bladder might be a potential target organ of DM toxicity in zebrafish, which contributed more information to the evaluation of DM's environmental risks.

TI  - Cardiotoxicity of forchlorfenuron (CPPU) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and H9c2 cardiomyocytes.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Forchlorfenuron (CPPU), as a plant growth regulator or herbicide/pesticide, is widely used in agriculture worldwide. It is adopted by most farmers due to its high efficacy for boosting size and improving the quality of fruit. However, CPPU was implicated in, and gained notoriety due to an incident of exploding watermelon that occurred in 2011. Subsequently, the wider community became aware of the potential risks it posed to living organisms and the ecosystem. In this study, we evaluated the effects of CPPU on the survival, cardiac morphology and function, as well as hematopoietic system, of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Notably, CPPU (2.5-12.5 μg/ml) induced cardiac morphology deformation, cardiac contractile dysfunction and erythrocyte reduction in zebrafish. Consistently, the mRNA expression levels of several cardiac and hematopoietic gene markers (myl7, gata4, mef2c, amhc, vmhc and gata1) were altered by CPPU treatment. In addition, CPPU caused cytotoxicity, cytoskeleton destruction and reduced corresponding proteins (Myl7, Gata4 and Mef2c) expression in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. Taken together, this study has identified the cardiotoxicity of CPPU in different experimental models and enhanced our understanding on the mechanism underlying the toxicity of CPPU to living organisms.

TI  - Oxidative effects of the acute exposure to a pesticide mixture of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos on carp and zebrafish - A comparative study.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - The use of commercial pesticides combinations increases the risk of intoxication in non-target aquatic organisms. Here, we investigate the potential of a commercial pesticide formulation containing (CYP) plus chlorpyrifos (CPF) to induce oxidative damage on two fish species (common carp and zebrafish). Carp and zebrafish were exposed for 96 h under laboratory conditions. Fish were divided in three different groups: CTL, 0.3 μg L(-1) or 0.6 μg L(-1) of CYP and 0.5 or 1 μg L(-1) of CPF in commercial formulation. Both carp and zebrafish showed an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity when compared to control group. Other oxidative parameters responded differently to exposure in carp and zebrafish. There were an increase in ascorbic acid (ASA) levels and decrease in catalase (CAT) activity and non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels in treated groups of carps. In the other hand, zebrafish showed significant decrease in ASA and increase in CAT activity and NPSH levels. Overall, we demonstrate noxious effects on redox parameters in two fish experimental models and different effects were observe in each fish species exposed to commercial pesticide formulation. This difference responses observed can be related with specific mechanisms of detoxification and antioxidant defense system of each species.

TI  - Acute and chronic toxic effects of fluoxastrobin on zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Fluoxastrobin is a new strobilurin fungicide, similar to azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin. Before the wide application of fluoxastrobin, the present study was performed to assay the acute and chronic toxicity of fluoxastrobin on zebrafish (Danio rerio). The 96-hour median lethal concentration (96h LC(50)) after initiation of zebrafish exposure to fluoxastrobin was 0.51mg/L with a 95% confidence interval of 0.45 to 0.57mg/L, indicating that fluoxastrobin was highly toxic to zebrafish. As endpoints, we assayed the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the degree of DNA damage at three different doses, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1mg/L on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The antioxidant enzymes partially ameliorated the ROS induced by fluoxastrobin t and were in turn inhibited by excess ROS, especially at 0.1mg/L. Lipid peroxidation and DNA damage were stimulated by ROS. The fluoxastrobin contents of the tested solutions were also determined; at the fluoxastrobin doses of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1mg/L, the contents on day 28 were 3.9, 5.0, and 0.64% greater than those on day 0. Thus, fluoxastrobin was relatively stable in an aquatic environment. In addition, the present study provided more information regarding the toxic effects of fluoxastrobin and the scientific methods for selection and evaluation of fungicides in the future.

TI  - Cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, and imidacloprid exposure up-regulates the mRNA and protein levels of bdnf and c-fos in the brain of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate the toxicity effects of frequently used pesticides, involving cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, on the expression of bdnf and c-fos genes in zebrafish brain tissues. Therefore, brain tissues exposed to intoxication was primarily analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Afterwards, the mRNA transcription levels of BNDF and c-fos genes and the protein levels were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The data of the immunofluorescence assay revealed intensive immunopositivity for bdnf and c-fos genes in the tissues exposed to pesticide intoxication in comparison to the control group (p\textless0.05). Moreover, the transcription levels of BNDF and c-fos genes, and protein levels were elevated following the intoxication (p\textless0.05, p\textless0.01, and p\textless0.001, respectively). These results showed that the exposure to the acute cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid intoxication disrupted the normal neuronal activity, resulting in neurotoxic effect, also DNA-binding Increasing c-fos activation, an oncoprotein from the family of the Nuclear Proteins, is also true of the knowledge that these chemicals are oncogenic in zebrafish brain tissues. Thus, the use of these pesticides poses a potential neuronal and oncogenic risk to the non-target organisms.

TI  - Toxic effects of boscalid in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Boscalid as one of the most widely used succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides has been frequently detected in both freshwater and estuarine environments. Its acute toxic effects on zebrafish and freshwater algae have been reported in our previous studies. To further investigate its chronic toxic effects to aquatic organisms, adult zebrafish were exposed for 28 days to a series of environmentally relevant boscalid concentrations in this study. Growth indicators and histopathology were determined in this study. Results indicated that boscalid inhibited the growth of zebrafish and induced damage in the kidneys and liver. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as the key pathways of energy metabolism in growth of zebrafish were also investigated. Results showed boscalid caused an increase in the activity of hexokinase (HK), the content of glycogen, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and insulin (INS) in liver and a decrease in blood glucose content and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Boscalid reduced the total content of triacylglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (TC) and the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in the liver. Correspondingly, expression of the genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in liver and intestine was affected by boscalid, especially in the significant upregulation of G6Pase and pparα and downregulation of SGLT-1 and AMY. Results suggested that boscalid could affect carbohydrate metabolism of adult zebrafish via regulation of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis at 0.1 mg/L. Moreover, boscalid might induce an increase in β-oxidation and a decrease in lipid synthesis at 0.01 mg/L. In conclusion, our study identified that carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are the possible biological pathways that mediate boscalid-induced developmental effects.

Thiacloprid was shown to have no effects on early life stage parameters, except on the heart rate. This effect was probably due to an increased metabolism upon exposure to the pollutant. Exposure to diazinon resulted in mortality which strongly increased with elevated temperature. Within the tested temperature range, increased mortality occurred particularly at concentrations of 2000 and 3000 microg/L diazinon. Observed sublethal effects were a decrease of the heart rate with increasing substance concentration, yolk sac edema, heart sac edema and spine deformations, particularly at concentrations of 2000 and 3000 microg/L diazinon. The hatching date was shown to be preponed with increasing temperature, most strikingly in combination with 2000 or 3000 microg/L diazinon. Mixtures of temperature and substance concentration as independent variables were shown to act synergistically in a dose-level-dependent manner on hatching rate, whereas the magnitude of synergism depended on effect levels.

TI  - Cyhalofop-butyl has the potential to induce developmental toxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in early life stage of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Cyhalofop-butyl is a selective herbicide widely employed in paddy field, which can transfer into aquatic environments. However, details of the environmental risk and aquatic toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl have not been fully investigated. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to a range of cyhalofop-butyl until 120 hour post-fertilization (hpf) to assess embryonic toxicity of the chemical. Our results demonstrated that cyhalofop-butyl was highly toxic to zebrafish embryos, with concentration-dependent negative effects in embryonic development. In addition, exposure to cyhalofop-butyl resulted in significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell apoptosis in heart area. The mRNA levels of the genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were also altered significantly after cyhalofop-butyl exposure. Moreover, the activity of capspase-9 and caspase-3 were significantly increased. Therefore, we speculated that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis should be responsible for abnormal development during embryogenesis after cyhalofop-butyl exposure.

TI  - Biochemical and histological alterations in adult zebrafish（Danio rerio）ovary following exposure to the tetronic acid insecticide spirotetramat.
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - As a new tetronic acid derivative insecticide, spirotetramat has been reported to be toxic to an array of aquatic organisms. However, the toxic effects of spirotetramat on zebrafish especially at ovary are still obscure. Hereby, the acute toxicity of spirotetramat towards zebrafish（Danio rerio），as well as the changes on biochemical and histological traits of ovary were investigated. The acute toxicity test results showed that the median lethal concentration (LC(50)) value of spirotetramat were 9.61 mg/L and 7.21 mg/L at 72 h and 96 h, respectively, suggesting spirotetramat has moderate toxicity to zebrafish. In the following sub-lethal toxicity test, the gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and gonadotropic hormone receptor (FSHR and LHR) together with the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in ovary were measured at 14, 21, and 28 days after exposure to 36, 360 and 720 μg/L. Under high concentration treatment (360 and 720 μg/L), MDA content, the relative transcription CAT and SOD gene level increased significantly in ovary (p \textless 0.05). That indicated sub-lethal doses spirotetramat caused oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in zebrafish ovary during the entire experimental period. Under the exposure to spirotetramat at 720 μg/L after 14 days, the relative transcript FSHR gene level was down regulated, and the relative transcript LHR gene level was up regulated. Moreover, spirotetramat affected the oocyte development especially on the diameter size and maturation during the ovary tissue biopsies at 28 days. Taken together, these findings revealed the adverse effects of spirotetramat on fish from the biochemical and histological aspects.

TI  - Toxic Effects of Bromothalonil and Flutolanil on Multiple Developmental Stages in Zebrafish.
T2  - Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - In this study, we applied various developmental stages of zebrafish to address the potential environmental risk and aquatic toxicity of bromothalonil and flutolanil. This results demonstrated that the acute toxicity of bromothalonil to the three phases of zebrafish were 4.34 (embryo) \textless 3.27 (12 h old larvae) \textless 2.52 mg/L (adult fish) and that of flutolanil were 5.47 (embryo) \textless 4.09 (72 h old larvae) \textless 3.91 (12 h old larvae) \textless 2.70 mg/L (adult). Sublethal effects induced by both bromothalonil and flutolanil on zebrafish embryos were noted, including growth inhibition, abnormal spontaneous movement, slower heart rate, complete hatching failure, and morphological deformities. In addition, both bromothalonil and flutolanil could cause notochord deformation and short body length of larvae. This study provides a foundation for future investigation into the mechanism of bromothalonil and flutolanil toxicity in zebrafish.

TI  - Thifluzamide affects lipid metabolism in zebrafish (Danio reio).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Thifluzamide, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide, has been widely used in rice fields throughout the world and causes hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio reio). This study was conducted to investigate the effect of thifluzamide on lipid metabolism in zebrafish after exposure to a control or, 0.019, 0.19, or 1.90mg/L thifluzamide for 28days. Following exposure, pathological changes in the liver were evaluated. Total cholesterol (TCHO) level, and triglyceride (TG) levels as well as hepatic lipase (HL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-I) activities were measured. In addition, the expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism were quantified. No obvious accumulation of lipid droplets was detected in the liver following any of the thifluzamide treatments. TCHO and TG levels were significantly decreased. FAS activity was markedly decreased, and CPT-I activity was significantly increased in the 0.19 and 1.90mg/L groups. However, no apparent changes in HL and LPL activities were observed in any of the treatment groups. Additionally, the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism showed corresponding changes. The results suggest that altered gene expression and enzyme activities might be responsible for the changes in lipid metabolism, as evidenced by the decreased TCHO and TG levels. Overall, thifluzamide altered lipid metabolism and led to events that might contribute to developmental toxicity in exposed zebrafish.

TI  - Changes in thyroid hormone levels and related gene expressions in embryo-larval zebrafish exposed to binary combinations of bifenthrin and acetochlor.
T2  - Ecotoxicology (London, England)
AB  - Bifenthrin (BF) and acetochlor (AT) are widely used as an insecticide and herbicide, respectively, which are introduced to the aquatic environment as a natural result. Although the thyroid active substances may coexist in the environment, their joint effects on fish have not been identified. We examined the joint toxicity of BF and AT in zebrafish (Danio rerio) in this study. An acute lethal toxicity test indicated that the median lethal concentration (LC(50)) values of BF and AT under 96 h treatment were 0.40 and 4.56 µmol L(-1), respectively. The binary mixture of BF + AT displayed an antagonistic effect on the acute lethal toxicity. After 14 days post fertilization (dpf) with exposure to individual pesticides at sub-lethal concentrations of, no effects were observed on the catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities, while the binary mixtures (except for the 7.2 × 10(-3) µmol L(-1) BF + 1.2 × 10(-2) µmol L(-1) AT exposure group) significantly induced the CAT activity. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and triiodothyronine (T3) level were significantly increased in all exposure groups. The thyroxine (T4) level remained unchanged after exposure to individual pesticides, but significantly increased in the 7.2 × 10(-3) µmol L(-1) BF + 1.2 × 10(-2) µmol L(-1) AT group. The expressions of the genes Dio2, TRa, TSHβ and CRH in the thyroid hormone (TH) axis were significantly up-regulated in the 7.2 × 10(-3) µmol L(-1) BF + 0.4 × 10(-2) µmol L(-1) AT group. Our data indicated that the binary mixture of BF + AT significantly altered the antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expressions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and changed the TH levels.

TI  - Gene expression patterns and related enzymatic activities of detoxification and oxidative stress systems in zebrafish larvae exposed to the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicide.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The present study aims to assess the effects of 2,4-D herbicide on biotransformation and oxidative stress status of zebrafish larvae. Animals were exposed to a range of sublethal concentrations (0.02-0.8 mg/L) and biomarkers at transcriptomic level and biochemical level were assessed. Chemical analysis with showed that the bioaccumulation of 2,4-D in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae were increased in a concentration-dependent manner. This herbicide induced significant effects at both gene expression and enzymatic activities levels after at 96 hpf. Results of mRNA expression showed a differential transcription regulation with all target genes depending on the tested concentrations. The mRNA level of gsr and cyp1a were up regulated at the highest dose of herbicide (0.8 mg/L). The gene expression of gstp1 showed an up regulation at lower dose (0.02 mg/L) and a down regulation at the highest dose (0.8 mg/L) of 2,4-D. A significant induction of EROD activity and inhibition of GST activity were noted in groups exposed to 0.8 mg/L of 2,4-D. Considering the antioxidant defenses, the activity of CAT was increased in larvae exposed to 0.8 mg/L of herbicide and GPx activity was induced at lower doses of 2,4-D (0.02 and 0.051 mg/L). Moreover, peroxidative damage, assessed as MDA content, was markedly increased in larvae exposed to high 2,4-D concentration. Overall, the present study data indicate that bioaccumulation of 2,4-D in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae and alterations in detoxification and oxidative stress related parameters, likely associated with ROS production, which may endanger the embryo-larval stages development of fish.

TI  - Impact of co-exposure of aldrin and titanium dioxide nanoparticles at biochemical and molecular levels in Zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - Aldrin (ALD), a persistent-organic-pollutant (POP), an organochlorine-cyclodiene-pesticide is highly toxic in nature. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNP) are widely used for various industrial applications. Despite the remarkable research on pesticide toxicity, the work with impact of nanoparticles on POP has been dealt with marginally. Chemicals co-exist in the environment and exhibit interactive effects. An investigation was carried out to evaluate the individual and combined effects of ALD (6 ppm) and TNP (60 ppm) exposure at sub-lethal concentration for 24 h in zebrafish. Significant reversal of lipid peroxidation level in liver and brain tissues and restoration in enhanced catalase activity in all examined tissues were observed in combined group. For other parameters, combined exposure of ALD and TNP does not show significant reversal action on ALD toxicity. Further studies are inline to understand combined effects of both to achieve significant reversal of ALD toxicity by TNP nanoparticles with threshold concentration of aldrin.

TI  - Zebrafish developmental screening of the ToxCast™ Phase I chemical library.
T2  - Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emerging toxicity screening model for both human health and ecology. As part of the Computational Toxicology Research Program of the U.S. EPA, the toxicity of the 309 ToxCast™ Phase I chemicals was assessed using a zebrafish screen for developmental toxicity. All exposures were by immersion from 6-8 h post fertilization (hpf) to 5 days post fertilization (dpf); nominal concentration range of 1 nM-80 μM. On 6 dpf larvae were assessed for death and overt structural defects. Results revealed that the majority (62%) of chemicals were toxic to the developing zebrafish; both toxicity incidence and potency was correlated with chemical class and hydrophobicity (logP); and inter-and intra-plate replicates showed good agreement. The zebrafish embryo screen, by providing an integrated model of the developing vertebrate, compliments the ToxCast assay portfolio and has the potential to provide information relative to overt and organismal toxicity.

TI  - Chlorothalonil causes redox state change leading to oxidative stress generation in Danio rerio.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - A diverse range of chemicals are used in agriculture to increase food production on a large scale, and among them is the use of pesticides such as chlorothalonil, a broad-spectrum fungicide used in the control of foliar fungal diseases. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0 μg/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 μg/L and 10 μg/L, and after the exposure period, the tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4 days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to the metabolism taking place in the gills.

TI  - Synthesis of low and high chlorinated toxaphene and comparison of their toxicity by zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo test.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Toxaphene, also known as camphechlor, is a persistent organochlorine pesticide of complex composition. It is technically produced by photochlorination of camphene with elemental chlorine gas under ultraviolet irradiation. In the present work, a novel, laboratory-scale synthesis using sulfuryl chloride as a chlorinating reagent is described. This approach allowed the degree of chlorination of the resulting mixtures to be arbitrarily adjusted by varying the reaction conditions. Both the compositions and the chlorine contents of the low- and high-chlorinated mixtures acquired using this method were similar to those of environmentally altered toxaphene and technical toxaphene, respectively. For comparison of these mixtures regarding toxicity, they were subjected to the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo test. Median effective concentrations (EC50s) were calculated based on the presence of lethal and nonlethal embryonic malformations. Surprisingly, low-chlorinated toxaphene, comprising compounds that also are present in environmentally transformed toxaphene, exhibited a twofold-higher toxicity (according to the EC50 for nonlethal effects) toward the test organisms compared with high-chlorinated toxaphene, the composition of which resembled that of the technical product. Although the effective concentrations in the embryo test were much higher than those in aquatic ecosystems burdened with toxaphene, the present results lead to the assumption that toxaphene is becoming more toxic during transformation in the environment. A decrease in the total amount of toxaphene during environmental breakdown would then be compensated for, at least in part, by the higher toxicity of weathered toxaphene in sediments, soils, and biota of contaminated ecosystems.

TI  - The embryonic developmental effect of sedaxane on zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides have been extensively used in agriculture, and some of their potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms have been demonstrated recently. Sedaxane (SDX) is a broad spectrum SDHI fungicide. Despite being extensively used in environment, little is known about its potential developmental effect in zebrafish embryo. This study examined the effects of which SDX triggered in zebrafish through embryonic development assessments. Results show that SDX induced mortality, hatch delay and failure in zebrafish embryos, which were concentration dependent. In addition, several developmental abnormalities were observed at 2 mg/L and higher concentrations, including edema, microcephaly, body deformation, and swim bladder not fully inflated. SDX exposure influenced reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione in live larvae, which indicated that oxidative stress was caused in zebrafish. Furthermore, SDX induced decrease of succinate dehydrogenase activity in zebrafish larvae. These results provide toxicological data of SDX on developing zebrafish embryo, which could be help for further understanding the potential risk on the environment.

TI  - The effects of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers on metabolic profile following exposure to zebrafish (Danio rerio) as well as the histopathological changes.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole are the worldwidely used fungicides. However, limited information is known about the toxicological effects of their enantiomers on aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish were separately exposed to 100 and 1000 μgL(-1) hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers for 21 d (1)H NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that the exposure of low and high dose of hexaconazole enantiomers altered energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of zebrafish, with the different metabolic profiles resulted from the same dose of (+)-hexaconazole and (-)-hexaconazole. Similar to hexaconazole enantiomers, the metabolic profiles, including the changes related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, were demonstrated in low and high dose epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups. There are differences in the metabolic profiles of zebrafish between exposed to (+)-epoxiconazole and (-)-epoxiconazole of the same dose. The results of histological examination revealed that the exposure of both enantiomers for hexaconazole and epoxiconazole resulted in the similar histopathological changes. The exposure of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers at low and high dose resulted the vacuolization and swell in the liver of the female and male zebrafish. Compared to female zebrafish, more liver damage was found in male zebrafish in the hexaconazole enantiomers exposure groups. The reduction of spermatids was observed in hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups of both doses. Hexaconazole enantiomers exposure of low and high dose resulted the increase in the number of mature eggs, while such effect was not observed in epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure groups. Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure resulted in no changes in brains of female and male zebrafish. As a result, both triazole-based chiral bactericides, hexaconazole and epoxiconazole, have similar toxicological effects but their mechanisms of action are not exactly the same. The above results will play an important part in making the differences in toxic effects of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers clear. What's more, it is an indispensable part for an integrated environmental risk assessment.

TI  - Mitochondria as a target of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides: Revisiting common mechanisms of action with new approach methodologies.
T2  - Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)
AB  - Mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a potential cause of developmental defects in humans. We evaluated 51 organophosphate and carbamate pesticides using the U.S. EPA ToxCast and Tox21 databases. Only a small number of them bind directly to cholinesterases in the parent form. The hydrophobicity of organophosphate pesticides is correlated significantly to TSPO binding affinity, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction in HepG2 cells, and developmental toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio (p \textless 0.05). Structural analysis suggests that in some cases the Krebs cycle is a potential target of organophosphate and carbamate exposure at early life stages. The results support the hypothesis that mitochondrial effects of some organophosphate pesticides-particularly those that require enzymatic activation to the oxon form-may augment the documented effects of disruption of acetylcholine signaling. This study provides a proof of concept for applying new approach methodologies to interrogate mechanisms of action for cumulative risk assessment.

TI  - Prochloraz effects on biomarkers activity in zebrafish early life stages and adults.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Zebrafish early life stages (ELS) assays have been increasingly used to assess the toxicity of chemicals and waste waters, showing a great potential due to the wide variety of endpoints that can be incorporated in the test. Moreover, zebrafish ELS test have been proposed, mainly for ethical reasons, as a surrogate for tests with adults. In this work, the fungicide Prochloraz (PCZ) was used as a chemical model to compare sensitivities of embryos/larvae and adult zebrafish focusing on lethality and biomarkers as endpoints. Effects on embryo development were also assessed. Organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) guidelines were followed and adapted to include the analyses of the biomarkers cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The acute toxicity of PCZ for zebrafish ELS and adults seemed to be similar with 96 h-LC₅₀ values of 8.5 and 4.6 mg/L, respectively. However, biomarkers were only responsive in larvae indicating a higher sensitivity of this life stage at sublethal level. PCZ also proved to be teratogenic: at intermediate concentrations effects on embryo development could be noticed, including spine deformations, edemas, lack of pigmentation, slower heart rate, and complete hatching failure. At the lowest concentrations, the more relevant effects (edemas and abnormal absorption of the yolk sac) were observed after hatching. The measurement of biomarkers in the zebrafish ELS assay seems to a useful tool in the detection of chemical effects showing higher sensitivity than adults. Further research should focus on the link between biomarkers responses in larvae and effects at later life stages of zebrafish.

TI  - Changes in Neurotransmitter Profiles during Early Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Development and after Pesticide Exposure.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - During early development, neurotransmitters are important stimulants for the development of the central nervous system. Although the development of different neuronal cell types during early zebrafish (Danio rerio) development is well-studied, little is known of the levels of neurotransmitters, their precursors and metabolites during development, and how these levels are affected by exposure to environmental contaminants. A method based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has been applied for the first time to zebrafish embryos and larvae to study five neurotransmitter systems in parallel, including the dopaminergic-andrenergic, glutaminergic-GABAnergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic systems. Our method enables the quantification of neurotransmitters and their precursors and metabolites in whole zebrafish from the period of zygote to free-swimming larvae 6 days postfertilization (dpf). We observed a developmental stage-dependent pattern with clear differences between the first 2 days of development and the following days. Whereas the neurotransmitter levels steadily increased, the precursors showed a peak at 3 dpf. After exposure to several pesticides, significant differences in concentrations of neurotransmitters and precursors were observed. Our study revealed new insights about neurotransmitter systems during early zebrafish development and showed the usefulness of our approach for environmental neurotoxicity studies.

TI  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) ability to activate ABCC transporters after exposure to glyphosate and its formulation Roundup Transorb®.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The emergent demand for food production has increased the widespread use of pesticides, especially glyphosate-based herbicides as they can protect different types of crops, especially transgenic ones. Molecules of glyphosate have been found in water bodies around the world, and its presence can cause negative effects on non-target organisms, such as fish. Glyphosate toxicity appears to be systemic in fish but does not affect their organs equally. Also, its formulations can be more toxic than pure glyphosate. In this sense, we investigated if these variations in toxicity could be related to ATP binding cassette subfamily C (ABCC) transporters and the cellular detoxification capacity, following exposure to herbicides. Thus, adults of Danio rerio were exposed (24 and 96 h) to glyphosate and Roundup Transorb® (RT) at an environmental concentration of 0.1 mg/L, and the activity of ABCC proteins and gene expression of five isoforms of ABCC were analyzed. Glyphosate and RT exposure increased ABCC protein activity and gene expression up to 3-fold when compared to controls, indicating the activation of detoxification mechanisms. Only in the brain of D. rerio, the exposure to RT did not stimulate the activity of ABCC proteins, neither the expression of genes abcc1 and abcc4 that responded to the exposure to pure glyphosate. These results may suggest that the brain is more sensitive to RT than the other target-tissues since the mechanism of detoxification via ABCC transporters were not activated in this tissue as it was in the other.

T2  - Pesticide biochemistry and physiology
AB  - Azoxystrobin is a frequently used fungicide in agriculture. Its toxicological effects on non-target organisms have aroused attention. In the present work, the toxic effects of azoxystrobin on zebrafish (Danio rerio) were investigated. Male and female zebrafish were separately exposed to a control solution and three azoxystrobin treatments (1, 10, and 100μg/L) and were sampled on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were accumulated in excess in the zebrafish livers. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly inhibited in the male zebrafish. Moreover, a notable decrease was also observed after day 21 in the female zebrafish. Catalase (CAT) activity was induced by the azoxystrobin treatments with the exception of the 1μg/L treatment. A significant increase in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was observed after day 21. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was generated, and DNA damage was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, azoxystrobin induced oxidative stress and genotoxicity in zebrafish livers.

TI  - Thiamethoxam induces oxidative stress and antioxidant response in zebrafish (Danio Rerio) livers.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Thiamethoxam, a second-generation neonicotinoid insecticide, was found to be toxic to nontarget aquatic organisms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the toxicity of thiamethoxam (0.30, 1.25, and 5.00 mg/L) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) livers at the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and DNA damage were used to evaluate the toxic effects of thiamethoxam on zebrafish. Compared to control groups, ROS levels were ascended in the exposure period; SOD and CAT activities were dramatically increased during early exposure and then inhibited. GST activity only increased on days 28. MDA content was slightly elevated on days 21 and 28. Additionally, a clear dose-response relationship was found for DNA damage. In conclusion, thiamethoxam could induce oxidative stress and DNA damage on the exposed zebrafish. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 31: 2006-2015, 2016.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish embryos exposed to deltamethrin.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Deltamethrin (DTM), a type II pyrethroid, is one of the most commonly used insecticides. The increased use of pyrethroid leads to potential adverse effects, particularly in sensitive populations such as children and pregnant women. None of the related studies was focused on the transcriptome responses in zebrafish embryos after treatment with DTM; therefore, RNA-seq, a high-throughput method, was performed to analyze the global expression of differential expressed genes (DEGs) in zebrafish embryos treated with DTM (40 and 80 μg/L) from fertilization to 48 h postfertilization (hpf) as compared with that in the control group (without DTM treatment). Two cDNA libraries were generated from treated embryos and one cDNA library from nontreated embryos, respectively. Over 92% of reads mapped to the reference in these three libraries. It was observed that many differential genes were expressed in comparison with embryos before and after DTM. The 20 most differentially expressed upregulated or downregulated genes were majorly involved in the signaling transduction. Validation of selected nine genes expression using qRT-PCR confirmed RNA-seq results. The transcriptome sequences were further subjected to gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, showing G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, respectively, were most enriched. The data from this study contributed to a better understanding of the potential consequences of fish exposed to DTM, to an evaluation of the potential threat of DTM to fish populations in aquatic environments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Chlorpyrifos exposure induces lipid metabolism disorder at the physiological and transcriptomic levels in larval zebrafish.
T2  - Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica
AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used insecticide in pest control, and it can affect aquatic animals by contaminating the water. In this study, larval zebrafish were exposed to CPF at concentrations of 30, 100 and 300 μg/l for 7 days. In the CPF-treated group, lipid droplet accumulation was reduced in larval zebrafish. The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and pyruvate were also decreased after CPF exposure. Cellular apoptosis were significantly increased in the heart tissue after CPF exposure compared with the control. Transcription changes in cardiovascular genes were also observed. Through transcriptome analysis, we found that the transcription of 465 genes changed significantly, with 398 upregulated and 67 downregulated in the CPF-treated group, indicating that CPF exposure altered the transcription of genes. Among these altered genes, a number of genes were closely related to the glucose and lipid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the transcription of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, TC synthesis, and lipogenesis were significantly decreased in larval zebrafish after exposure to CPF. These results indicated that CPF exposure induced lipid metabolism disorders associated with cardiovascular toxicity in larval zebrafish.

TI  - Thyroid endocrine disruption of acetochlor on zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae.
T2  - Journal of applied toxicology : JAT
AB  - The herbicide acetochlor is widely used and detected in the environment and biota, and has been suspected to disrupt the thyroid endocrine system, but underlying mechanisms have not yet been clarified. In the present study, zebrafish larvae (7 days post-fertilization) were exposed to a series concentration of acetochlor (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 µg l(-1) ) within a 14-day window until 21 days post-fertilization. Thyroid hormones and mRNA expression profiles of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were analyzed. Exposure to the positive control, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3 ), altered the mRNA expression, suggesting that the HPT axis in the critical window of zebrafish responded to chemical exposure and could be used to evaluate the effects of chemicals on the thyroid endocrine system. The mRNA expressions of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (tshβ, slc5a5 and tpo) were upregulated significantly with acetochlor treatment, which might be responsible for the increased thyroxine concentrations. The downregulation of genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (dio1 and ugt1ab) and transport (ttr) in zebrafish larvae exposed to acetochlor might further explain the increased thyroxine levels and decreased T3 levels. The mRNA expression of the thyroid hormone receptor (trα) was also upregulated upon acetochlor exposure. Results suggested that acetochlor altered mRNA expression of the HPT axis-related genes and changed the whole body thyroid hormone levels in zebrafish larvae. It demonstrated that acetochlor could cause endocrine disruption of the thyroid system by simulating the biological activity of T3 . Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Oxidative Stress Response Induced by Butachlor in Zebrafish Embryo/Larvae: The Protective Effect of Vitamin C.
T2  - Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - The widespread contamination and persistence of the herbicide butachlor in the environment resulted in the exposure of non-target organisms. The present study investigated the toxicity effect of butachlor (1-15 µmol/L) and the protective effect of vitamin C (VC) against butachlor-induced toxicity in zebrafish. It was found that butachlor significantly increased the mortality and malformation rates in a dose-dependent manner, which caused elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) after 72 h exposure. Compared with butachlor treatment group, the protective effect of VC against butachlor-induced toxicity were observed after adding 40, 80 mg/L VC respectively. VC significantly decreased the mortality, malformation rates, ROS, MDA, and normalized antioxidant enzymes activities of zebrafish after 72 h exposure. The result shows VC has mitigative effect on butachlor-induced toxicity and it can be used as an effective antioxidant in aquaculture.

TI  - The herbicide atrazine affects sperm quality and the expression of antioxidant and spermatogenesis genes in zebrafish testes.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - The herbicide atrazine (ATZ) is used worldwide in the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds. The present study evaluated sperm quality parameters in zebrafish Danio rerio after 11-day exposure to nominal ATZ concentrations of 2, 10, and 100 μg L(-1). All ATZ concentrations caused a decrease in motility, mitochondrial functionality, and membrane integrity, as measured using conventional microscopy or fluorescence microscopy with specific probes. The DNA integrity of sperm was not affected. The levels of expression of genes related to spermatogenesis, antioxidant defenses, and DNA repair were also investigated using RT-qPCR. The ATZ caused transcriptional repression of the spermatogenesis-related genes SRD5A2 and CFTR, the antioxidant defense genes SOD2 and GPX4B, and the DNA repair gene XPC. This is the first study to show that environmentally relevant concentrations of ATZ significantly affect the sperm quality in fish, possibly resulting in reduced fertility rates. In addition, we showed that the repression of genes related to spermatogenesis and cellular defense could be part of the mechanisms involved in the ATZ toxicity in the testes of male fish.

TI  - Impacts of isopyrazam exposure on the development of early-life zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - Isopyrazam (IPZ) is a broad spectrum succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicide. Little is known about its potential ecological risks of aquatic organisms recently. The present study examined the embryonic development effects of zebrafish exposed to IPZ under static condition using a fish embryo toxicity test. The lowest observed effect concentration of IPZ was 0.025 mg/L in 4-day exposure. Developmental abnormalities, including edema, small head deformity, body deformation and decreased pigmentation, and mortality were observed in zebrafish embryos of 0.05 mg/L and higher concentrations, which shown concentration dependency. The heart rate of zebrafish was disrupted by IPZ. Moreover, enzyme and gene experiments shown that IPZ exposure caused oxidative stress of zebrafish. Furthermore, it induced a decrease of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme activity and gene transcription level in zebrafish larvae. It can be speculated that IPZ may have a lethal effect on zebrafish, which is accompanied by decreased SDH activity, oxidative stress, and abnormality. These results provide toxicological data about the IPZ on aquatic non-target organisms, which could be useful for further understanding potential environmental risks.

TI  - Morphological and Immunohistochemical Modifications in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Gills After Short-Term Exposure to the Fungicide Tebuconazole.
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - In agroecosystems, a variety of pesticides may enter aquatic habitats exerting a number of toxic effects on living organisms. Due to their wide use and the repeated application, fungicides can be found at a much greater concentration than other agrochemicals in all environmental compartments. One of these fungicides, tebuconazole (TBZ), has been recognized as an endocrine-disrupting chemical, and the available literature focuses mainly on this mechanism of action. In the present study by subjecting the zebrafish model to an environmentally realistic concentration of TBZ, we clearly demonstrate that this fungicide has the potential to induce severe morphological and ultrastructural alterations in gills. The main morphological effects recorded in this study were as follows: the proliferation of the main epithelium, ectopia of chloride cells, lamellar shortening, necrosis, and apoptosis. TBZ exposure also resulted in the overtime decrease in the expression of both Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and aquaporin 3 and in the induction of oxidative stress enzyme (superoxide dismutase-1) as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis. Our results clearly indicate that respiratory and osmoregulatory disorders represent an important mechanism of TBZ toxicity on Danio rerio gills. This is the first evidence of sublethal effects exerted by TBZ on fish gills and highlights the harmful properties of this fungicide, even at very low concentration.

TI  - The organochlorine pesticide toxaphene reduces non-mitochondrial respiration and induces heat shock protein 70 expression in early-staged zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Toxaphene is a restricted-use pesticide produced by reacting chlorine gas with camphene. It was heavily used as a pesticide for agricultural purposes in the 1960-1970s, but despite being banned \textgreater30 years ago, it can remain elevated in the soil due to its resistance to metabolic degradation; this has led to longstanding concerns about elevated levels of toxaphene and other organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the environment. The objective of this study were to determine the effects of waterborne exposure to toxaphene on early life stages of zebrafish. Based on the LC(50), zebrafish embryos were exposed to control (embryo rearing media or DMSO) or to one dose of toxaphene ranging between 0.011 and 111.1 μg/mL from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) up to 120 hpf. Significant mortality and hatch time delays were observed in embryos exposed to toxaphene (at or above 0.11 and 1.11 μg/mL, depending on the assay). Higher prevalence of deformities was noted at higher doses (≥0.011 μg/mL), and these included pericardial edema and skeletal deformities. As energy production is important for normal development, mitochondrial bioenergetics were assessed in embryos following toxaphene exposure. Embryos exposed to 11.1 or 111 μg/mL toxaphene for 24 h showed lower non-mitochondrial respiration (\textasciitilde30%) compared to both solvent and no treatment controls. Expression of transcripts related to oxidative damage responses and apoptosis were measured and heat shock protein 70 was significantly increased with 111 μg/mL toxaphene (14.5 fold), while the expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 9, and superoxide dismutase 1 were not changed. These data demonstrate that developmental deformities induced by toxaphene include pericardial edema and skeletal deformity, and that toxaphene can affect oxidative phosphorylation in early staged zebrafish.

TI  - Atrazine affects craniofacial chondrogenesis and axial skeleton mineralization in zebrafish ( Danio rerio).
T2  - Toxicology and industrial health
AB  - Atrazine is a commonly used herbicide that has previously been implicated as an endocrine-disrupting compound. Previous studies have shown that estrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds affect the development of the heart, cartilage, and bone in zebrafish ( Danio rerio). To determine whether atrazine has effects similar to other endocrine disruptors, zebrafish embryos were treated with a range of atrazine concentrations. Atrazine treatment at a low concentration of 0.1 µM resulted in significant differences in craniofacial cartilage elements, while concentrations ≥1 µM led to decreased survival and increased heart rates. Fish treated with ≥1 µM atrazine also developed with delayed vertebrae mineralization. Higher concentrations of atrazine caused gross craniofacial defects and decreased hatching rates. Further studies into the molecular pathways disrupted in these developmental processes could shed light on a link between endocrine-disrupting compounds and developmental abnormalities.

TI  - Estrogenic and toxic effects of methoxychlor on zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been suggested as a good candidate for screening potential endocrine disruptors, little information is available on the effects of weak estrogens on this species. We investigated the sensitivity of different life stages of zebrafish toward toxic and estrogenic properties of methoxychlor (MXC). Short-term tests with adults resulted in a sex-specific 96-h lethal concentration for 50% (LC50) of the test animals of 36 microg/L for males and 129 microg/L for females. To determine the estrogenic capacity of MXC, adult zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.5, 5, and 50 microg MXC/L for 14 d. Induction of vitellogenin ([VTG] measured with protein electrophoresis and Western blot) in males was detected at 5 and 50 microg MXC/L. Females, however, did not exhibit higher blood VTG concentrations at the tested MXC concentrations. In a second series of experiments, juvenile zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 microg MXC/L for 33 d. Survival, length, weight, and condition of larvae were examined as indicators of toxic stress and the VTG content in whole body homogenates of juveniles was measured to determine xenoestrogenic effects. No effects of the tested concentrations of MXC were observed. Finally, the effect of MXC on zebrafish eggs, exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 32 microg MXC/L, was examined. Hatching and survival of hatched zebrafish were affected at 10 and 32 microg MXC/L. This study demonstrated that adult male zebrafish are sensitive toward the estrogenic effects of MXC. However, the use of VTG induction to detect effects of (xeno)estrogens in early life stages has to be further investigated, as low concentrations of VTG were detectable in exposed as well as unexposed juvenile fish.

TI  - Atrazine exposure elicits copy number alterations in the zebrafish genome.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Atrazine is an agricultural herbicide used throughout the Midwestern United States that frequently contaminates potable water supplies resulting in human exposure. Using the zebrafish model system, an embryonic atrazine exposure was previously reported to decrease spawning rates with an increase in progesterone and ovarian follicular atresia in adult females. In addition, alterations in genes associated with distinct molecular pathways of the endocrine system were observed in brain and gonad tissue of the adult females and males. Current hypotheses for mechanistic changes in the developmental origins of health and disease include genetic (e.g., copy number alterations) or epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) mechanisms. As such, in the current study we investigated whether an atrazine exposure would generate copy number alterations (CNAs) in the zebrafish genome. A zebrafish fibroblast cell line was used to limit detection to CNAs caused by the chemical exposure. First, cells were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations and a crystal violet assay was completed, showing confluency decreased by \textasciitilde60% at 46.3μM. Cells were then exposed to 0, 0.463, 4.63, or 46.3μM atrazine and array comparative genomic hybridization completed. Results showed 34, 21, and 44 CNAs in the 0.463, 4.63, and 46.3μM treatments, respectively. Furthermore, CNAs were associated with previously reported gene expression alterations in adult male and female zebrafish. This study demonstrates that atrazine exposure can generate CNAs that are linked to gene expression alterations observed in adult zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis providing a mechanism of the developmental origins of atrazine endocrine disruption.

TI  - Benomyl induction of brain aromatase and toxic effects in the zebrafish embryo.
T2  - Journal of applied toxicology : JAT
AB  - Benomyl is a benzimidazole fungicide that has been widely used on a variety of food crops and ornamental plants. It is known to cause adverse effects on reproductive systems, including decreased testicular and epididymal weights and reduced epididymal sperm counts and fertility. The brain aromatase gene is up-regulated by estrogens and estrogen mimics and considered a target gene to screen estrogen mimics. This study was designed to test the estrogenic potential and toxic effects of benomyl in the zebrafish system, and validated this system as a model that may correspond to the effect of benomyl in rodents. Concentrations of 20 x 10(-6), 40 x 10(-6) and 80 x 10(-6) M of benomyl-treated embryos showed decreased survival, hatching and heart rates, and increased incidence of malformations, such as pericardial edema, spinal lordosis, elongated heart, head edema, eye lens protrusion and caudal fin disappearance. Benomyl induced enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) in transient zebrafish embryos with a brain aromatase-based reporter gene. In this study, we determined that benomyl has estrogenic potential based on zebrafish brain aromatase gene induction, and that benomyl is toxic at 20 x 10(-6) M concentration and higher. These results demonstrate the usefulness of zebrafish embryos as an in vivo system to examine the estrogenic and developmental toxic potential of unknown compounds.

TI  - Transcriptional profiles of glutathione-S-Transferase isoforms, Cyp, and AOE genes in atrazine-exposed zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) superfamily consists of multiple members involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Expressional pattern of the GST isoforms in adult fish has been used as a biomarker of exposure to environmental chemicals. However, GST transcriptional responses vary across organs, thus requiring a cross-tissue examination of multiple mRNAs for GST profiling in an animal after chemical exposure. Zebrafish embryos express all GST isoforms as adult fish and could therefore represent an alternative model for identification of biomarkers of exposure. To evaluate such a possibility, we studied a set of cytosolic and microsomal GST isoform-specific expression profiles in the zebrafish embryos after exposure to atrazine, a widely used herbicide. Expression of the GST isoforms was compared with that of CYP genes involved in the phase I of xenobiotic metabolism and antioxidant enzyme (AOE) genes. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we showed dynamic changes in the expressional pattern of twenty GST isoforms, cyp1a, cyp3a65, ahr2, and four AOEs in early development of zebrafish. Acute (48 and 72 h) exposure of 24 h-old embryos to atrazine, from environmentally relevant (0.005 mg/L) to high (40 mg/L) concentrations, caused a variety of transient, albeit minor changes (\textless2.5-fold) in the GST isoforms, ahr2 and AOE genes response. However, expression of cyp1a and cyp3a65 mRNA was markedly and consistently induced by high doses of atrazine (5 and 40 mg/L). In summary, an analysis of the response of multiple systems in the zebrafish embryos provided a comprehensive understanding of atrazine toxicity and its potential impact on biological processes.

TI  - Label-free and iTRAQ proteomics analysis in the liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio) following dietary exposure to the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin.
T2  - Journal of proteomics
AB  - The organochlorine dieldrin (DLD) bioaccumulates in lipid-rich tissues and is associated with immunosuppression, altered metabolism, and cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of DLD on the hepatic proteome in zebrafish following dietary treatment as the liver is central to metabolism. Females were fed a control dose or one of three doses of DLD-contaminated food pellets over 21 days. Both label-free and iTRAQ proteomics were conducted as two complementary methods to expand coverage of the proteome. Label-free proteomics quantified 1563 proteins: 6 proteins showed a linear dose-response with DLD. iTRAQ quantified \textgreater3500 proteins; 5 proteins were decreased and 34 proteins were increased in abundance within the liver with all three doses. Overall, DLD reduced the abundance of proteins associated with glucose and cholesterol metabolism, lipid oxidation, liver function, and immune-related processes. Few proteins were identified by both methods as being altered (\textasciitilde1%), suggesting that each method detected different subsets of proteins. Protein responses in the liver were largely dependent on dose, however proteins related to liver and organ function, centrosome separation, glucose/energy metabolism, and immune-related pathways were confirmed by each independent technique and were suppressed with DLD exposure. This study identifies proteomic responses that are associated with organochlorine-induced hepatotoxicity. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Environmental contaminants cause hepatotoxicity because the liver is the major organ for detoxification. The legacy pesticide dieldrin significantly bioaccumulates in tissues, and can affect molecular processes that can lead to liver pathology. LC MS/MS proteomics identified protein networks related to tumors, energy homeostasis, and chromosomal separation as those affected by dietary exposure to dieldrin. We applied two orthogonal mass spectrometry-based methods to more completely survey the liver proteome, strengthening data interpretation. These data improve understanding as to the effects of organochlorine pesticide toxicity in the liver and the study identifies proteome networks that can contribute to adverse outcome pathways for pesticide exposure.

TI  - Safety Assessment of Bacillus thuringiensis Insecticidal Proteins Cry1C and Cry2A with a Zebrafish Embryotoxicity Test.
T2  - Journal of agricultural and food chemistry
AB  - As a result of the large-scale planting of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops, fish would be exposed to freely soluble Bt insecticidal protein(s) that are released from Bt crop tissues into adjacent bodies of water or by way of direct feeding on deposited plant material. To assess the safety of two Bt proteins Cry1C and Cry2A to fish, we used zebrafish as a representative species and exposed their embryos to 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/L of the two Cry proteins until 132 h post-fertilization and then several developmental, biochemical, and molecular parameters were evaluated. Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a known toxicant to aquatic organisms, was used as a positive control. Although CPF exposure resulted in significant developmental, biochemical, and molecular changes in the zebrafish embryos, there were almost no significant differences after Cry1C or Cry2A exposure. Thus, we conclude that zebrafish embryos are not sensitive to Cry1C and Cry2A insecticidal proteins at test concentrations.

T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - In this work the effect of chlorpyrifos exposure on metabolic profiles of zebrafish muscle was evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. Different chemometric tools based on the selection of Regions of Interest and on Multivariate Curve-Resolution-Alternating Least Squares are proposed for the analysis of the complex data sets generated in the different exposure experiments. Analysis of Variance Simultaneous Component Analysis of changes on metabolite peak profile areas showed significant chlorpyrifos concentration and exposure time-dependent changes, clearly differentiating between exposed and non-exposed samples and between short (2 h) and long exposure times (6 h or 24 h). The changes observed in the concentrations of 50 muscle metabolites are indicative of induction of oxidative stress, of a general disruption of neurotransmitter metabolism, and of muscle exhaustion. These three effects are intimately related to the toxicity of chlorpyrifos.

TI  - The developmental effect of difenoconazole on zebrafish embryos: A mechanism research.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Difenoconazole is a widely used triazole fungicide and has been reported to have negative impacts on zebrafish embryos. To investigate the mechanism of its developmental toxicity, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L difenoconazole for 96 h. The morphological and physiological indicators of embryo development were tested. The total cholesterol (TCHO) level, triglyceride (TG) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were measured at 96 hpf (hours post-fertilization). In addition, the transcription of genes related to embryo development, the antioxidant system, lipid synthesis and metabolism was quantified. Our results showed that a large suite of symptoms were induced by difenoconazole, including hatching regression, heart rate decrease, growth inhibition and teratogenic effects. 0.5 mg/L difenoconazole could significantly increase the TG content of zebrafish embryos at 96 hpf, while no apparent change in the TCHO and MDA level was observed post 96 h exposure. Q-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) results showed that the transcription of genes related to embryonic development was decreased after exposure. Genes related to hatching, retinoic acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis were up-regulated by difenoconazole.

TI  - The regulation of transcriptome responses in zebrafish embryo exposure to triadimefon.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - The residue of triadimefon (TDF) (a pesticide) has become the pollutant in water due to its intensive use in agriculture and medicine, and its stability in water leaching from soil and vegetation. In this study, RNA-seq, a high-throughput method was performed, to analyze the global expression of differential expressed genes (DEGs) in zebrafish embryos treated with TDF (10 μg/mL) from fertilization to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf) as compared with that in the control group (without TDF treatment). Two cDNA libraries were generated from treated and non-treated embryos, respectively. With the 79.4% and 78.8% of reads mapped to the reference, it was observed that many differential genes were expressed between the two libraries. The most 20 differentially expressed up-regulated or down-regulated genes were involving in the signaling transduction, the activation of many genes related to cytochrome P450 enzymes, and molecular metabolism. Validation of seven genes expression confirmed RNA-seq results. The transcriptome sequences were further subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and showed diverse biological functions and metabolic pathways. The data from this study contributed to a better understanding of the potential consequences of fish exposed to TDF, and to evaluate the potential threat of TDF to fish population in the aquatic environment. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - The influence of size on the toxicity of an encapsulated pesticide: a comparison of micron- and nano-sized capsules.
T2  - Environment international
AB  - Encapsulation technology involves entrapping a chemical active ingredient (a.i.) inside a hollow polymeric shell and has been applied to commercial pesticide manufacturing for years to produce capsule suspension (CS) formulations with average particle sizes in the micron-scale. The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50 μm. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2 μm with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (\textasciitilde200 nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (\textasciitilde250 nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (\textasciitilde2200 nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20 μg a.i. L(-1) technical λ-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology.

TI  - Immunotoxic effects of atrazine and its main metabolites at environmental relevant concentrations on larval zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) and its main metabolites, i.e., diaminochlorotriazine (DACT), deisopropylatrazine (DIP), and deethylatrazine (DE), have been widely detected in surface water around the world. In the present study, to determine their immunotoxic effects, zebrafish during the early developmental stage were exposed to ATZ and its main metabolites at environmental concentrations (30, 100, 300 μg L(-1)). It was observed that ATZ, DACT, DIP and DE selectively induced the transcription of immunotoxic related genes including Tnfα, Il-1β, Il-6, Il-8, Cxcl-clc and Cc-chem in larval zebrafish. Pretreatment with ATZ and its metabolites also changed the immune response of larval zebrafish to LPS and E. coli challenge, which was indicated by the alternation in the mRNA levels of some cytokines. In addition, 300 μg L(-1) ATZ and DACT exposure could also increase the release of tryptase into water, indicating that they increased the anaphylactoid reaction in the larval zebrafish. According to these results, both of ATZ and its metabolites exposure could cause the immunotoxicity in larval zebrafish. Thus, we thought that the ecological risks of the metabolites of ATZ on aquatic organisms could not be ignored.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of the dithiocarbamate pesticide sodium metam in zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Sodium metam (NaM), a dithiocarbamate, is a general agricultural biocide applied prior to planting for the elimination of nematodes, soil pathogens, and weeds. There is a remarkable paucity of information about the mechanism of action and the risk that dithiocarbamates may pose to developing vertebrates. We have characterized NaM toxicity during early life stage exposure in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos are most sensitive to NaM exposure during gastrulation and early segmentation (4-14 hours post fertilization, hpf). For mortality, the dose response curve is steep with an LC(50) estimate of 1.95 microM (248 ppb) at 48 hpf. The most notable malformation among surviving embryos was a severely twisted notochord, which became evident by 24 hpf. Surprisingly, this notochord defect was not immediately lethal and the animals continued to grow despite delays in hatching, apparent paralysis, and an inability to feed. We have characterized the notochord malformation using histological and in situ hybridization techniques. collagen 2a1 mRNA expression is normally localized to the notochord sheath cells at 24 hpf, whereas in NaM-exposed embryos it is misexpressed in the notochord cells. Histological staining and myoD expression indicate that the myotomes of the NaM-exposed embryos are less defined, compacted and block-shaped compared to controls. The degradation product of NaM, methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), causes similar malformations at similar concentrations as NaM, suggesting that MITC or another common product may be the active toxicant. Our results indicate that developing zebrafish are sensitive to NaM and MITC and we believe that this model is ideal to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) and etiology of NaM toxicity in vertebrates.

TI  - MicroRNA-155 targets cyb561d2 in zebrafish in response to fipronil exposure.
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are a class of small noncoding RNAs, can modulate the expression of many protein-coding genes when an organism is exposed to an environmental chemical. We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl) sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561 (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR-155 mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when endogenous miR-155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR-155 inhibitor. The results improved our understanding of molecular mechanism of toxicity upon fipronil exposure, and presents miR-155 as a potential novel toxicological biomarker for chemical exposure. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid insecticides in zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Pyrethroid insecticides are one of the most commonly used residential and agricultural insecticides. Based on the increased use of pyrethroids and recent studies showing that pregnant women and children are exposed to pyrethroids, there are concerns over the potential for developmental neurotoxicity. However, there have been relatively few studies on the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, resmethrin, and bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an appropriate model for studying the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At doses approaching the LC(50), permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS-222 ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested in mammalian systems.

TI  - Enantioselectivity in zebrafish embryo toxicity of the insecticide acetofenate.
T2  - Chemical research in toxicology
AB  - Enantioselectivity in separation and toxicology of chiral xenobiotics have become one of the frontier topics interfacing chemistry and toxicology. In this study, enantiomers of insecticide acetofenate (AF) were separated on selected chiral columns by HPLC, and enantioselectivity in developmental toxicity was evaluated using the zebrafish embryo-larval assays. The AF enantiomers were baseline separated on Chiralcel OD, Chiralpak AD, and Sumichiral OA-2500I columns under optimized conditions. Pure enantiomers were obtained on Chiralcel OD. Optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) and circular dichroism (CD) detectors were used to determine the elution order and CD spectra of the enantiomers. The absolute configuration of enantiomers was identified as S-(+)-AF and R-(-)-AF by the octant rule from force-field calculations and CD spectra. The individual enantiomers were used in 4-day zebrafish embryo-larval bioassays, and a series of developmental end points were measured and compared. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to investigate the expressions of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in zebrafish embryo exposed to varying enantiomers. While the enantiomers showed no difference in acute toxicity, significant enantioselectivity was observed in developmental toxicities such as yolk sac edema and pericardial edema. The data of qRT-PCR showed that there was about 3.2-fold induction in the mRNA levels of ERalpha between fish exposed to (+)-AF and (-)-AF. The results suggest that enantioselectivity may occur at the developmental level even in the absence of selective acute toxicity and should be considered when evaluating ecotoxicological effects of chiral contaminants.

TI  - The lipid metabolism alteration of three spirocyclic tetramic acids on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Spirocyclic tetramic acids are widely used in controlling phytophagous mite species throughout the world. the data set is incomplete and provides insufficient evidence for drawing the same conclusion for fish. To fill the gap whether these acaricides alter lipid metabolism on vertebrates, zebrafish embryos exposed to a series concentration of pesticides, the developmental effects, enzyme activities and levels of gene expression were assessed, battery of biomarker utilized by the integrated biomarker response (IBRv2) model. The 96 h-LC(50) of spirodiclofen, spiromesifen and spirotetramat were 0.14, 0.12 and 5.94 mg/L, respectively. Yolk sac deformity, pericardial edema, spinal curvature and tail malformation were observed. Three spirocyclic acids were unfavouring the lipid accumulation of by inhibited the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthesis (FAS), fatty acid binding proteins (FABP2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. The total cholesterol (TCHO) level significantly decreased in the 0.072 mg/L spirodiclofen group and 0.015 and 0.030 mg/L in the spiromesifen groups. No expected change in spirotetramat group on the TCHO and triglycerides (TGs) levels for any of the treatments. The mRNA levels of the genes related to lipid metabolism also significantly altered. In both spirodiclofen and spiromesifen, ACC achieved the highest scores among a battery of biomarkers using integrated biomarker response (IBRv2). The results suggest that spiromesifen was the most toxic for embryos development and spirodiclofen was the most toxic for lipid metabolism in embryos. The 0.07 mg/L of spirodiclofen, 0.05 mg/L of spiromesifen and 2.00 mg/L would cause malformation on zebrafish embryos. This study will provide new insight that fatty acid metabolism may be a suitable biomarker for the spirocyclic tetramic acids in fish species.

TI  - Zebrafish embryos exposed to deltamethrin exhibit abnormalities despite induced expression of related genes ( you, you-too, momo and u-boot).
T2  - Toxicology and industrial health
AB  - Evaluation of the toxic effects of a widely used synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin (DM), was carried out in this study. This pesticide is preferred for pest control because of its low environmental persistence and toxicity. We investigated the expression pattern of four genes, namely, you ( you), yot ( you-too), momo ( mom) and ubo ( u-boot) during early development of zebrafish, that is, from 12 hpf to 48 hpf stages. These stages are selected as most of the important developmental aspects take place during this period. All four genes are known to play a vital role in development of notochord and somites. To understand the effect of DM on development, embryos of 4 hpf stage were exposed to two concentrations (100 and 200 µg/L) of DM, and observations were made at 12, 24 and 48 hpf stages. Our earlier studies have shown phenotypic abnormalities such as notochord bending, tail deformation, yolk sac and pericardial edema, lightening of body and eye pigmentation and interfered in somite patterning, during these stages of development. Understanding the relationship of phenotypic abnormalities with these four genes has been our primary objective. These four genes were analyzed by Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction and intensity of the bands has shown induction in their expression after exposure to the toxicant. In spite of the expression of genes, it was noticed that DM caused abnormalities. It can be said from the results that translational pathway could have been affected.

TI  - The effect of paclobutrazol on the development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - Paclobutrazol (PBZ), a trazole-containing fungicide, is widely used on food crops. Frequent usage of PBZ may contaminate water, but its toxicity to aquatic organisms is understudied. Although the chronic effects of PBZ exposure on reproductive, antioxidant defense, and liver metabolism systems in rockfish have been reported, the toxic effects of PBZ on aquatic embryos are unknown. Here, we report that PBZ disrupts the development of heart and craniofacial cartilage in zebrafish embryos, and decreases their survival and hatching rates. PBZ affects the normal process of cardiac looping, which may lead to a slower heart beat accompanied by pericardia edema and apoptotic myocytes. PBZ also decreases the population of migratory neural crest cells, which give rise to craniofacial cartilage. Our results reveal high embryonic toxicity of PBZ on aquatic organisms, and thus hold significance for the impact of fungicides on public health and ecology.

TI  - Comparison of the acute toxicity for gamma-cyhalothrin and lambda-cyhalothrin to zebra fish and shrimp.
T2  - Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP
AB  - Gamma-cyhalothrin 15CS (GCH) contains only the active stereoisomer of the two isomers found in lambda-cyhalothrin 25EW (LCH). GCH (0.5 x rate) provides equivalent overall insect control as LCH (1 x rate). Both formulations showed high acute toxicity to zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio H.B.) and shrimp (Macrobrachium nippoensis de Haan). The 96-h LC(50(zebra fish,GCH)) is 1.93 microg a.i/L and LC(50(zebra fish,LCH)) is 1.94 microg a.i/L. LC(50(shrimp,GCH)) is 0.28 microg a.i./L and LC(50(shrimp,LCH)) 0.04 microg a.i./L. This indicates that the toxicity to shrimp is likely stereochemistry-dependent. The fates of GCH and LCH are similar in laboratory simulated rice paddy water and their concentrations decrease rapidly, with no GCH or LCH detected after 3 or 4 days. Both are toxic to shrimp in a simulated paddy irrigation reservoir even though treated return water is diluted 5 times. No shrimp fatality is shown in the GCH-treated paddy water after a 4-day holding period, and longer than 5 days is necessary to reach a zero fatality rate for LCH. This is compatible with the 7-day water holding period considered reasonable in agricultural practice.

TI  - Cholin- and carboxylesterase activities in developing zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) and their potential use for insecticide hazard assessment.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Insecticides are a potential hazard for non-target organisms like fish particularly at run off events. The study of effects to embryos of the zebra fish Danio rerio is already an accepted tool in waste water monitoring, but effects of various groups of substances (like most pesticides) to the zebrafish embryo remain to be studied. Enzymes are often taken as biomarkers of exposure and effect. Therefore cholinesterase isozymes and carboxylesterase were examined for their suitability as biomarkers of insecticide exposure. The activities of cholinesterase and of carboxylesterase were monitored in the first 48 h post-fertilization (hpf) of zebrafish development. Significant specific activities in the range of 0.5-25 U could be measured from the sixth somite stage (12 h) up to the Long Pec stage (48 h) for different cholinesterases using acetyl-, acetyl-beta-methyl-, butyryl- and propionylthiocholin as substrates. The specific activity of carboxylesterase ranged from 4 to 16 Umg(-1) protein in the respective developmental stages. Substrate specificity was analysed using specific inhibitors (eserine sulphate, DPDA, BW284c51). The results showed that the observed cholinesterase activities in the whole embryo may be attributed mainly to acetylcholinesterase with a partial capability to use propionylthiocholine as a second substrate. The potential use of cholin- and carboxylesterase as biomarkers was investigated using the organophosphate paraoxon-methyl. A 40% inhibition of enzyme activities was reached by 0.4 microM paraoxon-methyl indicating the possible use of these enzymes as biomarkers of exposure.

TI  - Endemic shrimp Macrobrachium pantanalense as a test species to assess potential contamination by pesticides in Pantanal (Brazil).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Pantanal is a biome characterized by an extraordinary diversity and abundance of wildlife and houses several endemic species such as the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium pantanalense. However, the increase in agriculture and husbandry activities in the region has contributed with residues of pesticides reaching aquatic systems. The main objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity of the endemic shrimp M. pantanalense compared with other freshwater species: the shrimp M. amazonicum, the crustacean Daphnia similis and the fish Danio rerio. The sensitivity of these organisms was assessed through acute exposure to copper and cypermethrin (through the formulation Barrage(®), widely used in Pantanal). For copper the species sensitivity decreased in the following order: D. similis (48 h-EC(50) 0.051 mg/L) \textgreater M. pantanalense \textgreater D. rerio \textgreater M. amazonicum (48 h-LC(50) 26.34 mg/L). Copper caused reduced length of shrimps and zebrafish and reduced heartbeat of zebrafish embryos. For cypermethrin the species sensitivity decreased in the following order: M. pantanalense (96 h-LC(50) 0.05 μg/L) \textgreater M. amazonicum \textgreater D. similis \textgreater D. rerio (144 h-LC(50) 1680 μg/L). Major effects of cypermethrin included reduced length of shrimps and zebrafish, as well as early hatching and increased incidence of developmental deformities in zebrafish embryos. This study highlights the importance of using endemic species for risk evaluations in sensitive biomes such as Pantanal. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of testing pesticides toxicity as commercial formulations. Furthermore, we suggest that the endemic shrimp species M. pantanalense can be successfully used as a test species in ecotoxicology.

T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of metribuzin in surface waters on fish under experimental conditions. The effects of subchronic exposure to metribuzin on fish growth and the development of histopathological changes in selected organs (gill, kidney, liver) and on activity of some biochemical markers (CYP450, EROD) in Danio rerio were investigated during a 28-day toxicity test. Juvenile growth tests were performed on D. rerio according to OECD method number 215. Fish at an initial age of 30 days were exposed to a range of metribuzin concentrations (1.5, 5, 16, 33, and 53 mg L⁻¹). Exposure to metribuzin at 53 mg L⁻¹ was associated with increased mortality. Negative effects with regard to total body weight, length, and the inhibition of specific growth rate were induced at concentrations of 33 and 53 mg L⁻¹. Histopathological examination revealed pathological lesions in the liver in pesticide-exposed fish only at the highest concentration of 53 mg L⁻¹ of metribuzin. Based on the results of growth rate, biochemical markers (CYP450, EROD), and histopathological examination, the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) value was 33 mg L⁻¹ and the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) value was 16 mg L⁻¹.

TI  - The pesticide malathion reduces survival and growth in developing zebrafish.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Malathion is an organophosphorous pesticide widely used to control mosquitoes in urban areas and pests, such as boll weevils, in agricultural areas. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, are model organisms for developmental toxicology research because they are readily available, produce large numbers of clear embryos, and are sensitive to environmental changes. The nonlethal effects of malathion on developing zebrafish embryos, however, previously have not been analyzed quantitatively. We exposed zebrafish embryos to sublethal malathion concentrations to determine malathion's effects on a developing vertebrate. Zebrafish exposed to 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/L of malathion consistently elicited more rapid hatching from the chorion than zebrafish exposed to 2.0-, 2.5-, or 3.0-mg/L malathion concentrations. In addition, exposure to 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 mg/L of malathion resulted in significantly shorter body length and eye diameters, indicating that malathion had teratogenic effects on zebrafish embryos. Malathion's action as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and the toxicity of the metabolites of malathion may be responsible for malathion's teratogenic effects on fish development.

TI  - Metabolomic and Transcript Analysis Revealed a Sex-Specific Effect of Glyphosate in Zebrafish Liver.
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - Glyphosate is a component of commonly used herbicides for controlling weeds in crops, gardens and municipal parks. There is increasing awareness that glyphosate-based herbicides, in addition to acting on plants, may also exert toxicity in wildlife and humans. In this study, male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to 700 µg/L of glyphosate (GLY), for 28 days. We used the metabolomic approach and UHPLC-ESI-MS to analyze liver samples to investigate the adverse effects of glyphosate on hepatic metabolism. The impact of GLY was found to be sex-specific. In female, GLY exposure affected purine metabolism by decreasing the levels of AMP, GMP and inosinic acid, consequently increasing uric acid levels with respect to the control (CTRL). Exposure to GLY also caused a decrease of UMP levels in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. In male, GLY exposure decreased the aminoadipic acid within the lysine degradation pathway. Transcript analysis of genes involved in stress response, oxidative stress and the immune system were also performed. Results demonstrated an increased stress response in both sexes, as suggested by higher nr3c1 expression. However, the hsp70.2 transcript level was increased in female but decreased in male. The results demonstrated reduced sod1, sod2, and gpx1a in male following exposure to GLY, indicating an impaired oxidative stress response. At the same time, an increase in the cat transcript level in female was observed. mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukins litaf and cxcl8b.1 were increased in female. Taken together, the results provide evidence of disrupted nucleotide hepatic metabolism, increased stress inflammatory response in female and disruption of oxidative stress response in male.

TI  - Influence of sublethal doses of acetamiprid and halosulfuron-methyl on metabolites of zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio).
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, is reported to have adverse sublethal effects on non-target beneficial organisms. Halosulfuron-methyl (HM), one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, has high ecotoxicity to aquatic plants and animals. In this study, a GC-MS-based metabolomics approach was used to investigate the toxicity of acetamiprid and HM. The Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) software program and the retention index method were used to identify 51 metabolites in zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio). Changes in metabolites showed that acetamiprid and HM disturbed amino acid (e.g., leucine, valine, serine, glycine, proline, and alanine) metabolism, the TCA cycle (malic acid and fumaric acid), and the balance of neurotransmitters (glutamic acid, taurine, and glycine). The change in metabolites in the liver, head, and blood indicated that metabolites in the liver were more sensitive than those in the head and blood. Overall, on the basis of the change in metabolites, we identified a potential risk to zebra fish exposed to sublethal doses of acetamiprid and/or HM.

TI  - Effects of the bioconcentration and parental transfer of environmentally relevant concentrations of difenoconazole on endocrine disruption in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Difenoconazole, a typical triazole fungicide, inhibits lanosterol-14R-demethylase (CYP51) to prevent fungal sterol synthesis and its residues are frequently detected in the environment due to its wide application. Previous studies have demonstrated that difenoconazole altered the triglyceride levels, and gene expression relevant to cholesterol biosynthesis in zebrafish. However, endocrine-disruption in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal-liver (HPGL) axis, the effects of transferring to offspring, and the underlying mechanisms of difenoconazole in aquatic organisms are still unknown. In this study, we defined the effects of difenoconazole at environmental concentrations on endocrine disturbance using zebrafish as an experimental model. The results indicated that difenoconazole induced a significant change in the somatic index, and pathological variations in tissues, and steroid hormone levels. RT-PCR experiments further confirmed that difenoconazole significantly induced expression alteration of lhr, hsd3β, hsd11β, cyp19a in the ovary and star, cyp19a, cyp3c1 in the testis, and erα genes in livers. In addition, difenoconazole exposure in parental zebrafish affected the hatchability and length of its offspring. Moreover, the burdens of difenoconazole and difenoconazole alcohol in females were higher than in males. These findings highlighted that difenoconazole exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations elicited estrogenic endocrine-disruption effects via altering homeostasis of sex steroid hormones in the HPGL axis and the adverse effects can be transferred to the offspring.

TI  - Effect of toxaphene on reproduction of fish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The effect of Toxaphene on fish reproduction was investigated in sexually mature female zebrafish fed for two weeks with food contaminated with three different concentrations of the Pesticide (0.02, 0.23 and 2.2 micrograms/g fish/day). No overt differences were observed in reproductive success as assessed by examination of (a) total number of eggs spawned by each female, (b) percentage of fertilized eggs 24 hours after fertilization, (c) percentage of embryo mortality 72 hours after fertilization and (d) percentage of hatching 72 hours after fertilization. By contrast Toxaphene produced distinct effects of a dose response nature on oviposition. This observation is not only of interest with respect to Toxaphene, but also points to the importance of evaluating other pesticides for their effect on the oviposition of feral species that might be even more sensitive than zebrafish. Toxicity of Toxaphene was manifested both in the parent fish (skin discoloration, subcutaneous hemorrhages, particularly around the gill areas and backbones curved in the vertical plane) and in hatching embryos (half hatched).

TI  - Effects of ammonium-based ionic liquids and 2,4-dichlorophenol on the phospholipid fatty acid composition of zebrafish embryos.
T2  - PloS one
AB  - Ionic liquids consisting of a combination of herbicidal anions with a quaternary ammonium cation act as efficient herbicides, which are under consideration to be used in the agriculture. In the present study, we used embryos of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to assess the toxic potential of ammonium-based ionic liquids for aquatic organisms. As we assumed interference of the partially hydrophobic ionic liquid cation with lipids, we investigated the adaptation response in the lipid composition of the zebrafish embryos, triggered by the ionic compound. Therefore, the impact of ammonium-based ionic liquids with different lengths of the alkyl chain ([C6,C6,C1,C1N][Br], [C8,C8,C1,C1N][Br]) on the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profile of zebrafish embryos up to 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) was examined. Furthermore, the changes in the unsaturation index (UI) of PLFAs, as the sum parameter of membrane fluidity in eukaryotic cells, were presented. The PLFA's UI in the zebrafish embryos upon exposure to quaternary ammonium salts was compared to the UI of the embryos upon exposure to nonionic 2,4-dichlorophenol, which has a similar hydrophobicity but is structurally different to [C8,C8,C1,C1N][Br]. It was shown that for ammonium-based ionic liquid precursors non-specific mode of action occurs and the toxic effect on lipid composition of zebrafish embryos can be well predicted based on chemical properties, like hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the changes in PLFAs, expressed by the UI, can be useful to study toxic effects of organic contamination. However, for zebrafish embryos, after ionic liquids and 2,4-DCP exposure, the changes were observed at high lethal concentrations, which caused the incidence of lethality of 30 and 50% of a group of test animals.

TI  - Endocrine disrupting effects of tebuconazole on different life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Tebuconazole is a widely used fungicide that has been detected in water ecosystems, of which the concentrations may affect the endocrine function of aquatic organisms. At present study, tissue-specific bioaccumulation of tebuconazole was found in ovary of adult zebrafish, indicating a potential risk of endocrine disruption. In order to evaluate the potential endocrine disrupting effects, three life stages (2 hpf (hours post-fertilization) -60 dpf (days post-fertilization), Stage I; 60-120 dpf, Stage II; 180-208 dpf, Stage III) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were chronically exposed to tebuconazole at the concentrations ranging from 0.05 mg/L to 1.84 mg/L. Result showed that exposed to tebuconazole could lead to a male-biased sex differentiation in juvenile zebrafish and significant decrease of the percentage of germ cells in sexually-mature zebrafish. Egg production was significantly inhibited by 57.8% and 19.2% after Stage II- and Stage III-exposures, respectively. The contents of 17β-estradiol in gonad decreased by 63.5% when exposed to 0.20 mg/L tebuconazole at Stage II and by 49.5% after exposed to 0.18 mg/L tebuconazole at Stage III, respectively. For all stages exposure, reductions in 17β-estradiol/testosterone ratio were observed, indicating an imbalance in steroids synthesis. Additionally, tebuconazole reduced the expression of cyp19a, which was consistent with the decrease of E2 level. In overall, the present findings indicated that, playing as an anti-estrogen-like chemical, tebuconazole inhibited the expression of Cyp19, thereby impairing steroid hormones biosynthesis, leading to a diminished fecundity of zebrafish.

T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - In this study, the effects of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) in males and females of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were studied. The liver microsomal cytochrome P450 content, NADPH-P450 reductase, aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND), and erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) activity were measured. Zebrafish were exposed to control and 3 treatments (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg L(-1)) of atrazine for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days. The results indicated that, within the range of test atrazine concentrations, either P450 content or P450 isozyme activities could be induced by atrazine. Compared to controls, P450 content was significantly increased at all atrazine concentrations at days 10, 15, and 20; thereafter, at day 25, all concentrations decreased to approximately the control levels, both in males and females. In addition, the strongest induction of P450 content was observed on day 15 in males and day 10 in females at treatment concentrations of 1 mg L(-1). NADPH-P450 reductase activities showed mild increase in males; however, the females exhibited significant induction on days 15, 20, and 25; especially, at concentrations of 0.01 mg L(-1), the induction level was consistently increased during the experiment. The inducements of APND and ERND in males were mainly observed on the days 5, 10, and 15, which showed less distinct induction, while significant induction was observed in cases of treatments during all days in females. In conclusion, atrazine induces P450 enzymes in zebrafish, and the effects may function as significant toxicity mechanisms in zebrafish. Additionally, it also confirms the importance of using a combined multi-time and multi-index diagnostic method to enhance the sensitivity and effectiveness of the indices adopted.

TI  - Embryonic Atrazine Exposure Elicits Alterations in Genes Associated with Neuroendocrine Function in Adult Male Zebrafish.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis states that exposure to environmental stressors early in life can elicit genome and epigenome changes resulting in an increased susceptibility of a disease state during adulthood. Atrazine, a common agricultural herbicide used throughout the Midwestern United States, frequently contaminates potable water supplies and is a suspected endocrine disrupting chemical. In our previous studies, zebrafish was exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion (μg/l) atrazine through embryogenesis, rinsed, and allowed to mature to adulthood. A decrease in spawning was observed with morphological alterations in offspring. In addition, adult females displayed an increase in ovarian progesterone and follicular atresia, alterations in levels of a serotonin metabolite and serotonin turnover in brain tissue, and transcriptome changes in brain and ovarian tissue supporting neuroendocrine alterations. As reproductive dysfunction is also influenced by males, this study assessed testes histology, hormone levels, and transcriptomic profiles of testes and brain tissue in the adult males. The embryonic atrazine exposure resulted in no alterations in body or testes weight, gonadosomatic index, testes histology, or levels of 11-ketotestosterone or testosterone. To further investigate potential alterations, transcriptomic profiles of adult male testes and brain tissue was completed. This analysis demonstrated alterations in genes associated with abnormal cell and neuronal growth and morphology; molecular transport, quantity, and production of steroid hormones; and neurotransmission with an emphasis on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axes. Overall, this data indicate future studies should focus on additional neuroendocrine endpoints to determine potential functional impairments.

TI  - Toxicokinetics of Polar Chemicals in Zebrafish Embryo (Danio rerio): Influence of Physicochemical Properties and of Biological Processes.
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - The time-resolved uptake of 17 nonionic and ionic polar compounds (logD ≤ 2) with a diversity of functional groups into zebrafish embryos (ZFE) was studied over 96 h of exposure. Among them were pharmaceuticals, pesticides and plant active ingredients. Uptake rates for the diffusion controlled passive uptake through the ZFE membrane ranged from 0.02 to 24 h(-1) for the nonionic compounds and were slower for ionic compounds (\textless0.008-0.08 h(-1)). The study compounds did not enrich much in the ZFE (median bioconcentration factor of 1, max. 7). Biotransformation significantly influenced the internal concentration of some of the test compounds over time (benzocaine, phenacetin, metribuzin, phenytoin, thiacloprid, valproic acid). For benzocaine, valproic acid and phenacetin several transformation products (TPs) were observed by LC-MS already at early life-stages (before 28 hpf); for benzocaine the TPs comprised \textgreater90% of the initial amount taken up into the ZFE. For six compounds internal concentrations remained very low (rel. int. conc. \textless 0.2). Besides biotransformation (sulfamethoxazole), poor membrane permeability (cimetidine, colchicine) and also affinity to efflux transporters (atropine and chloramphenicol) are the likely reasons for these low internal concentrations. This study outlines that the uptake of polar compounds into ZFE is influenced by their physicochemical properties. However, biological processes, biotransformation and, likely, efflux can strongly affect the internal concentrations already in early developmental stages of the ZFE. This should be considered in future toxicokinetic modeling. The evaluation of the toxicity of chemicals by ZFE requires toxicokinetic studies of the test compounds and their TPs to increase comparability to effects in fish.

TI  - Analysis of differentially expressed proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to chlorpyrifos.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - In this study, the protein expression profiles of zebrafish embryos under chlorpyrifos (CPF) stress were investigated. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.25 mg/L CPF, and embryo samples were collected until 24 h post-fertilization (hpf). To gain a better understanding of the response of zebrafish embryos to CPF exposure, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to carry out a comparative proteomic analysis. Total proteins were extracted from the control and treated samples, separated by 2D PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. A total of 59 protein spots showed reproducible changes compared with the control. Of these 59 spots, 19 were selected and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/TOF) analysis; 9 differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified, including 3 up-regulated proteins and 6 down-regulated proteins. The increased expression of 3 proteins associated with detoxification and stress response suggested that the activation of protective proteins was required in zebrafish embryos exposed to CPF. On the other hand, the decreased expression of 6 proteins is mainly involved in cytoskeleton structure, protein translation, signal transduction and lipoprotein metabolism. These data may help us understand the functions and the molecular mechanisms of these proteins in zebrafish embryos' response to CPF exposure.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of zebrafish brain tissue following exposure to the pesticide prochloraz.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - The hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis plays a central role in the maintenance of homeostasis and disruptions in its function can have important implications for reproduction and other critical biological processes. A number of compounds found in aquatic environments are known to affect the HPG axis. In the present study, we used two-dimensional electrophoresis to investigate the proteome of female and male zebrafish brain after 96 h exposure to the fungicide prochloraz. Prochloraz has known effects on a number of key HPG molecules, including antagonism of Cyp17 and Cyp19 (aromatase). Twenty-eight proteins were shown to be differentially expressed in the brains of females and 22 in males. Proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS and identities were examined relative to brain function in the context of changing steroid hormone levels. There was little overlap between sexes in proteins exhibiting differential expression. Proteins with known roles in metabolism, learning, neuroprotection, and calcium regulation were determined to be differentially regulated. Relationships between identified proteins were also examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and females were shown to exhibit enrichment of several metabolic pathways. We used differentially expressed proteins to establish a putative classifier consisting of three proteins that was able to discriminate prochloraz-exposed from control females. Putatively impacted brain functions and specific protein changes that were observed have the potential to be generalized to other that similarly impact steroid hormone levels.

TI  - [Utilization of embryo development technique of Brachydanio rerio to evaluating toxicity on various chemicals].
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
AB  - The application of Brachydanio rerio embryo development technique to research on environmental science was summarized in this paper. This testing technique was approved as one of standard methods for chemical toxicity test, especially for teratogensis, by international organizations (OECD, DIN). There are many advantages of this testing, e.g., low cost, easy operation, high sensitivity and multiple sensible endpoints, comparing with other toxicity testing. Also, it was used to judge toxic mechanism of chemicals. The embryo development of zebrafish can be affected obviously by heavy metal, pesticide, organic reagent and complex chemicals. Among them, Cu and Hg appeared stronger toxicity, and Cr was weaker for heavy metals. TPTA and Lindane were higher toxicity within pesticide, and they were higher toxicity if the organic reagent with one or more halogen substituent(s) and aminobenzene. These results were correspondent with other toxicity testing, and it showed higher sensitivity, especially a sublethal endpoint was selected. Therefore, it can be expected to test toxicity and teratogensis on mixed pollutant monitoring.

TI  - Toxic effects of indoxacarb enantiomers on the embryonic development and induction of apoptosis in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Indoxacarb is a highly potent insecticide widely used to control Lepidoptera insects in vegetable, tea, cotton, and rice fields. It can run off into aquatic environments. It is consisted of two enantiomers. Environmental risks and aquatic toxicity of indoxacarb enantiomers have not been fully investigated. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to varying concentrations of (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb until 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) to assess the embryonic toxicity. (-)-R-indoxacarb was 1.3-fold more toxic than (+)-S-isomer to zebrafish embryos at 96 hpf. (-)-R-indoxacarb exhibited reduction in body length and pericardial edema compared with (+)-S-indoxacarb. (-)-R-indoxacarb decreased the hatching rate sixfold greater than (+)-S-indoxacarb. The rate of pericardial edema induced by (-)-R-indoxacarb was 2.5 times greater than that by (+)-S-indoxacarb. The heart rate of the larvae exposed to (-)-R-indoxacarb was 30% lower than that to (+)-S-indoxacarb. In addition, exposure to the chiral isomers resulted in significant increases in apoptosis; interestingly (-)-R-indoxacarb induced apoptosis in the heart area, whereas (+)-S-indoxacarb induced apoptosis in the head area. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Quizalofop-P-ethyl exposure increases estrogen axis activity in male and slightly decreases estrogen axis activity in female zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - The herbicide Quizalofop-P-ethyl (QpE) exerts toxic effects in fish, but limited information is currently available on its effects on the endocrine system. In the current study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 20, 200μg/L) of QpE for 30days. In males, QpE exposure significantly increased plasma estradiol (E2) and vitellogenin (VTG) levels, concomitant with up-regulation of hepatic esr1 and vtg gene expression. In females, plasma sex hormone levels and VTG concentrations were not altered significantly, but an increased expression of hepatic esr1 in addition to decreased expression of hepatic vtg, esr2a and esr2b was observed. Marked histological lesions were also observed in the gonads of both males and females. Moreover, QpE exposure significantly increased transcriptional profiles of some genes in the HPG axis and liver in males, while the majority of these genes were down-regulated in females. Docking studies showed QpE forming stable interactions with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of zebrafish ESR1 and ESR2a, suggesting QpE may bind to estrogen receptors (ESRs). This study for the first time reveals QpE as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) disrupting the zebrafish endocrine system in a sex-specific manner, whereby it increases estrogen axis activity in males and slightly decreases estrogen axis activity in females, which may be accounted for by QpE regulating steroidogenesis and/or activating ESR(s).

TI  - Sex specific response in cholesterol level in zebrafish (Danio rerio) after long-term exposure of difenoconazole.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Difenoconazole is a widely used triazole fungicide, its extensive application may potentially cause toxic effects on non-target organisms. To investigate the effect of difenoconazole on cholesterol content and related mechanism, adult zebrafish were exposed to environmental related dosage (0.1, 10 and 500 μg/L) difenoconazole. The body weight and hepatic total cholesterol (TCHO) level was tested at 7, 15 and 30 days post exposure (dpe). The expressions of eight cholesterol synthesis genes and one cholesterol metabolism gene were assessed via Quantitative PCR method. The significant decrease of TCHO level in male zebrafish liver was observed at 15 and 30 dpe, which was accompanied by apparent hepatic cholesterol-genesis genes expression decline. In comparison with males, female zebrafish showed different transcription modification of tested genes, and the cholesterol content maintain normal level during the whole exposure.

TI  - Oxidative stress response and gene expression with atrazine exposure in adult female zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is the most common pesticide of freshwater ecosystems in the world. The effects of ATZ exposure on the induction of oxidative stress and the alteration of gene expression were studied in liver and ovary samples from female zebrafish (Danio rerio). Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT), in addition to the GSH and MDA content, in the liver altered significantly; the mRNA levels for the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, such as Cu/Zn-Sod, Mn-Sod, Cat, and Gpx, were up-regulated significantly in the liver when zebrafish were exposed to various concentrations of ATZ for 14d. However, the mRNA induction patterns were not in accordance with those of antioxidant enzyme changes in the liver and ovary. Moreover, the transcriptional expression of mitochondrial inner membrane genes related to ROS production, such as Ucp-2 and Bcl-2, were altered significantly in high ATZ treatment groups. However, the ATZ treatment did not induce any apparent changes in the transcriptional expression of CoxI, Ndi, or ATPo6, which are related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to study the transcriptional effects of ATZ stress on zebrafish. The information presented in this study will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress induced by ATZ in fish.

TI  - Changes in ultrastructure and expression of steroidogenic factor-1 in ovaries of zebrafish Danio rerio exposed to glyphosate.
T2  - Journal of toxicology and environmental health. Part A
AB  - Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum organophosphate (OP) herbicide, highly soluble in water, and when applied in terrestrial systems it penetrates into soil, eventually reaching the aquatic community and affecting nontarget organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of glyphosate on ovaries of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Ovaries (n = 18 per triplicate) were exposed to 65 μg/L of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] for 15 d. This concentration was determined according to Resolution 357/2005/CONAMA/Brazil, which establishes the permissible concentration of glyphosate in Brazilian inland waters. Nonexposed ovaries (n = 18 per triplicate) were used as control. Subsequently, morphology and expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) of exposed and nonexposed ovaries was determined. No apparent changes were noted in general morphology of exposed and nonexposed ovaries. However, a significant increase in diameter of oocytes was observed after exposure to glyphosate. When ovarian ultrastructure was examined the presence of concentric membranes, appearing as myelin-like structures, associated with the external membranes of mitochondria and with yolk granules was found. After glyphosate exposure, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting revealed greater expression of SF-1 in the oocytes, which suggests a relationship between oocyte growth and SF-1 expression. These subtle adverse effects of glyphosate on oocytes raised a potential concern for fish reproduction. These results contribute to understanding glyphosate-induced toxicity to nontarget organisms, showing subcellular and molecular impairments that may affect reproduction in +female fish.

TI  - Juvenile exposure to vinclozolin shifts sex ratios and impairs reproductive capacity of zebrafish.
T2  - Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)
AB  - Exposure to endocrine disruptors during critical periods of development can impact the sustainability of wild fish populations. Anti-androgenic compounds have received less attention, but are capable of modulating gonad differentiation and maturation, and impairing reproduction in fish. The fungicide vinclozolin (VZ) has been shown to impair reproduction in adult fish, but less is known about its effects following exposure earlier in development. Here we show that waterborne exposure to 400μg VZ/L during critical periods of sex differentiation (21-35 days post fertilization) permanently shifts sex ratios towards females, and alters the maturation of the gonad. Both fecundity and fertility were reduced, even when oogenesis and spermatogenesis recover and sperm motility is not altered. These results demonstrate the need to better understand the impacts of early exposure to anti-androgenic compounds on fish.

T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - The study presented here aimed to characterize the effects of acetochlor on expression of genes related to endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, apoptosis and immune system in zebrafish during its embryo development. Different trends in gene expression were observed after exposure to 50, 100, 200μg/L acetochlor for 96h. Results demonstrated that the transcription patterns of many key genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal/thyroid (HPG/HPT) axis (e.g., VTG1, ERβ1, CYP19a and TRα), cell apoptosis pathway (e.g., Bcl2, Bax, P53 and Cas8), as well as innate immunity (e.g., CXCL-C1C, IL-1β and TNFα) were affected in newly hatched zebrafish after exposure to acetochlor. In addition, the up-regulation of CAT, GPX, GPX1a, Cu/Zn-SOD and Ogg1 suggested acetochlor might trigger oxidative stress in zebrafish. These finding indicated that acetochlor could simultaneously induce multiple responses during zebrafish embryonic development, and bidirectional interactions among oxidative stress, apoptosis pathway, immune and endocrine systems might be present.

TI  - Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of hepatic injury upon naphthalene exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Ecotoxicology (London, England)
AB  - Naphthalene has been used worldwide as a commercial insecticide for decades, which when detected in the environment can have various negative effects on non-target organism, such as hepatotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms of how naphthalene acts to affect the liver in zebrafish (Danio rerio) remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the potential toxic effects of naphthalene on livers in female adult zebrafish over a 21-day subacute exposure. Global hepatic gene expression was examined by microarrays and the results indicated the regulated genes were associated significantly with vital hepatic injury pathways and GO categories upon naphthalene exposure, such as disruptions in lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and the carcinogenic processes. According to our observations of liver histology, nuclear enlargement as a potential indicator of cancers and hepatic lipometabolic disorder precisely were supported. The 96 h acute naphthalene tests on Tg(lysC:DsRed) and LiPan lines larvae revealed recruitment of neutrophils by the liver, as well as decreased liver size, which further confirmed hepatic inflammation response to naphthalene exposure. Thus, these findings advance the field of ecotoxicology by unveiling a new role of naphthalene as a leading cause of liver damage and provide potential biomarker-genes for environmental naphthalene monitoring.

AB  - Cypermethrin (CYP), a widely used Type II pyrethroid pesticide, is one of the most common contaminants in the freshwater aquatic system. We studied the effects of CYP exposure on the induction of hepatic oxidative stress, DNA damage and the alteration of gene expression related to apoptosis in adult zebrafish. Hepatic mRNA levels for the genes encoding antioxidant proteins, such as Cu/Zn-Sod, Mn-Sod, Cat, and Gpx, were significantly upregulated when zebrafish were exposed to various concentrations of CYP for 4 or 8 days. In addition, the main genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation and the mitochondrial genes related to respiration and ATP synthesis were also significantly upregulated after exposure to high concentrations (1 and 3 μg L(-1)) of CYP for 4 or 8 days. Moreover, in a comet assay of zebrafish hepatocytes, tail DNA, tail length, tail moment and Olive tail moment increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The significant induction (p\textless0.01) of all four parameters observed with CYP concentrations of 0.3 μg L(-1) or higher suggests that heavy DNA damage was induced even at low levels. Furthermore, several apoptosis- related genes, such as p53, Apaf1 and Cas3, were significantly upregulated after CYP exposure, and Bcl2/Bax expression ratio decreased, especially in groups treated with 1 and 3 μg L(-1) CYP for 8 days. Taken together, our results suggested that CYP has the potential to induce hepatic oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in zebrafish. This information will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of aquatic toxicology induced by CYP in fish.

TI  - Enantioselective toxic effects of mefentrifluconazole in the liver of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) based on transcription level and metabolomic profile.
T2  - Toxicology
AB  - Mefentrifluconazole, a new type of chiral triazole fungicide, is widely applied to control a variety of fungal diseases in crops. However, the toxicological effects of mefentrifluconazole on aquatic organisms are unknown, especially at the enantiomer level. In the present study, zebrafish were selected as a typical model for mefentrifluconazole enantiomer exposure. Metabolomic and transcription analyses were performed with 0.01 and 0.10 mg/L mefentrifluconazole and its enantiomers (i.e., rac-mfz/(-)-mfz/(+)-mfz) at 28 days. The (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics analysis showed that 9, 10 and 4 metabolites were changed significantly in the rac-mfz, (+)-mfz and (-)-mfz treatment groups compared with the control group, respectively. The differential metabolites were related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of lipid metabolism-, apoptosis- and CYP-related genes in the livers of female zebrafish in rac-mfz and (+)-mfz was 1.61-108.92 times and 2.37-551.34 times higher than that in (-)-mfz, respectively. The results above indicate that exposure to mefentrifluconazole induced enantioselective liver toxicity in zebrafish. Our study underlined the importance of distinguishing different enantiomers, which will contribute to environmental protection.

TI  - Atrazine exposure decreases the activity of DNMTs, global DNA methylation levels, and dnmt expression.
T2  - Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association
AB  - Atrazine, a herbicide used on agricultural crops is widely applied in the Midwestern United States as well as other areas of the globe. Atrazine frequently contaminates potable water supplies and is a suspected endocrine disrupting chemical. Previous studies have reported morphological, hormonal, and molecular alterations due to developmental and adulthood atrazine exposure; however, studies examining epigenetic alterations are limited. In this study, the effects of atrazine exposure on DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and kinetics were evaluated. Global DNA methylation levels and dnmt expression in zebrafish larvae exposed to 0, 3, or 30 parts per billion (ppb) atrazine throughout embryogenesis was then assessed. Results indicate that atrazine significantly decreased the activity of maintenance DNMTs and that the inhibition mechanism can be described using non-competitive Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, results show that an embryonic atrazine exposure decreases global methylation levels and the expression of dnmt4 and dnmt5. These findings indicate that atrazine exposure can decrease the expression and activity of DNMTs, leading to decreased DNA methylation levels.

TI  - Malachite green induces cardiovascular defects in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos by blocking VEGFR-2 signaling.
T2  - Biochemical and biophysical research communications
AB  - Malachite green (MG) is a triphenyl methane dye used in various fields that demonstrates high toxicity to bacteria and mammalian cells. When bud stage zebrafish embryos were treated with MG at 125, 150, and 175ppb for 14h, the development of trunk including intersomitic vessels was inhibited in MG-treated flk-1-GFP transgenic embyos. MG clearly induced whole growth retardation. MG induced severe cell death in trunk intersomite region of zebrafish embryos and in human vascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. MG inhibited heart rates and cardiac looping. MG attenuated whole blood formation and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced receptor (R)-2 phosphorylation in vascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, MG significantly alters the cardiovascular development causing growth retardation in zebrafish through the blocking VEGFR-2 activation in early cardiovascular development. It suggests that MG may be an environmental toxic agent with the potential to induce embryonic cardiovascular defects in vertebrates.

TI  - Evaluating the elimination of Brazilian entomopathogenic Bacillus by non-target aquatic species: an experimental study.
T2  - Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - Ecotoxicity tests are key to predict environmental hazards resulting from chemical and biological pesticides in non-target species. In order to assess the effects of microbial pesticides it is important to determine if they cause infection in test organisms. At present the microbial elimination rate or clearance is not included in ecotoxicological regulatory protocols. This study evaluated the elimination of Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus sphaericus from fish and snails, after 30 days' exposure to commercial formulations of such entomopathogens. Data obtained showed that in clean water the tendency to eliminate microbial agents from the body of the exposed organisms is gradual over time but after 7 days the fish and snails were free of the two tested Bacillus spp.

TI  - Embryonic exposure to cis-bifenthrin enantioselectively induces the transcription of genes related to oxidative stress, apoptosis and immunotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Fish & shellfish immunology
AB  - Cis-bifenthrin (cis-BF) is used widely for agricultural and non-agricultural purpose. Thus, cis-BF is one of the most frequently detected insecticides in the aquatic ecosystem. As a chiral pesticide, the commercial cis-BF contained two enantiomers including 1R-cis-BF and 1S-cis-BF. However, the difference in inducing oxidative stress, apoptosis and immunotoxicity by the two enantiomers in zebrafish still remains unclear. In the present study, the zebrafish were exposed to environmental concentrations of cis-BF, 1R-cis-BF and 1S-cis-BF during the embryos developmental stage. We observed that the mRNA levels of the most genes related to oxidative stress, apoptosis and immunotoxicity including Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-Sod), catalase (Cat), P53, murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 gene (Bcl2), Bcl2 associated X protein (Bax), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf1), Caspase 9 (Cas9), Caspase 3 (Cas3), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-8(Il-8) were much higher in 1S-cis-BF treated group than those in cis-BF or 1R-cis-BF treated ones, suggesting that 1S-cis-BF has higher risk to induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and immunotoxicity than 1R-cis-BF in zebrafish. The information presented in this study will help with elucidating the differences and environmental risk of the two enantiomers of cis-BF-induced toxicity in aquatic organisms.

TI  - The effects of subchronic exposure to terbuthylazine on zebrafish.
T2  - Neuro endocrinology letters
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Terbuthylazine belongs to the group of symmetrical triazine herbicides used extensively in agriculture and non-agricultural sites, primarily to control broadleaf and some grassy weeds that have become ubiquitous contaminants of the environment. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of terbuthylazine in surface waters on fish under experimental conditions. The effects of subchronic exposure to terbuthylazine on fish growth and the development of histopathological changes in selected organs (gill, kidney, liver), and on the activity of some biochemical parameters - glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and on the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in Danio rerio were investigated during a 28 day toxicity test. METHODS: Juvenile growth tests were performed on Danio rerio according to OECD guideline No. 215. Fish at the age of 30 days were exposed for 28 days to a range of sublethal concentrations of terbuthylazine (0.55 - environmental concentration, 150, 400, 700 and 1000 μg/L). RESULTS: There were no significant differences (p\textless0.05) between the specific growth rates (r) of the test groups and control group. Histopathological examination revealed pathological changes only in the liver in fish exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 700 and 1000 μg/L. Significant differences (p\textless0.05) in activities of biochemical markers were found in GST (400, 700 and 1000 μg/L), GR (700 and 1000 μg/L), significant differences (p\textless0.05) of TBARS concentration were found at 1000 μg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of growth rate, the histopathological examination of selected organs, and the results of biochemical parameters, it was found that the environmental concentration of terbuthylazine did not have any effects on juvenile D. rerio. The values of NOEC and LOEC for terbuthylazine for juvenile D. rerio were 150 μg/L and 400 μg/L.

T2  - Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - Two independent types of stressors, chemicals and high temperatures, which frequently act together in the environment, are addressed in this study. Pesticides (imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos) as well as a metal salt (nickel chloride) were investigated for their toxic effect at different temperatures. Tests focused on the early development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae (from fertilization up to 168 h postfertilization) when exposed to the three respective chemicals at an optimum temperature (26 degrees C) and three higher temperatures (up to 33.5 degrees C). At all temperatures tested, the two pesticides did not have a significant impact on the early development of the zebrafish at the highest test concentrations (imidacloprid, 50 mg/l; chlorpyrifos, 1 mg/l). Nickel led to a significant decrease of hatching success at all temperatures; the combination of elevated temperature and nickel exposure revealed a synergistic effect of both stressors.

TI  - DNA Damage Assessment in Zebrafish Embryos Exposed to Monceren(®) 250 SC Fungicide Using the Alkaline Comet Assay.
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - Monceren 250 SC is a commercial fungicide with the active ingredient 1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1-(cyclopentyl)-3-phenylurea, also known as pencycuron. This compound inhibits the growth of fungi as Rhizoctonia solani that invades potato, rice, and cotton or as Pellicularia spp, which contaminates lettuce and tomato crops. In this study, we assessed genotoxicity or DNA damage by the alkaline comet assay in zebrafish blastula-stage embryos exposed to 250 to 1250 μg/mL of the Monceren fungicide or to Bleomycin (0.25 μg/mL) used as a positive control. Additionally, survival and spontaneous movement were monitored in embryos after exposure to different concentrations of fungicide. DNA damage was evaluated using three genotoxicity parameters of the alkaline comet assay: tail length, tail moment, and tail intensity. We found that Monceren 250 SC fungicide induces DNA damage, as shown by significant increases in the three genotoxicity parameters in zebrafish embryos compared with control embryos nonexposed to Monceren. Tail intensity was the more accurate parameter to evaluate genotoxicity levels in zebrafish embryos. At 48 h after exposure to the fungicide, the survival rate of larvae-embryos was reduced to 40-45%. This study shows that the Monceren 250 SC fungicide exerts genotoxic effects in zebrafish during early stages of development.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the physiological response of male zebrafish Danio rerio to the fungicide tebuconazole and recovery in fungicide-free water. Acute toxicity tests were carried out and the median lethal concentration (LC(50)) from 24 to 96 h was calculated. The fish were exposed to a sublethal fungicide concentration of 230 microg/L for 7 or 14 days and allowed to recover for 7 or 14 more days, respectively. Whole-body levels of vitellogenins, triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, lactate and proteins as well as the activities gamma-glutamil transpeptidase (gamma-GT), alanin aminotransferase (AlAT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were assayed; corpulence factor (k) was also calculated. Fish exhibited significant increase of vitellogenins (Vtg), which continued to increase after 14 days of recovery. Levels of glucose, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides increased after 7 and 14 days of exposure. Finally, cholesterol and glucose recovered after 14 days of recovery whereas triglycerides and lactate continued to be elevated. Proteins and k remained unaltered the entire experiments. AAT, AlAT and AP enhanced during exposure and did not recover at the end (except AlAT). A longer recovery period should be necessary to re-establish fish physiology. These results alert about the multiple disruptive physiological actions that tebuconazole may have on fish.

TI  - Investigating mitochondria-immune responses in zebrafish, Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822): A case study with the herbicide dinoseb.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - The dinitrophenol herbicide dinoseb is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Studies in fish demonstrate impaired OXPHOS is associated with altered immune system responses and locomotor activity in fish. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dinoseb on zebrafish (Danio rerio) during early stages of development. We measured oxygen consumption rates of embryos, transcripts related to OXPHOS, growth, and the immune system (cytokines and immune-signaling transcripts), and locomotor activity. We hypothesized that OXPHOS of fish would be impaired in vivo, leading to altered basal immune system expression and locomotor activity. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos revealed that dinoseb decreased both mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration. Expression levels of cytochrome c oxidase complex IV, 3-hydroxyacyl-COA dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase 1 were decreased in larvae following exposure to dinoseb while succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A, insulin growth factor 1 (igf1) and igf2a mRNA were increased in abundance. Immune-related transcripts chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) were decreased in expression levels while toll-like receptor 5a and 5b were increased in expression. In addition, a visual motor response test was conducted on both 6 and 7 dpf larvae to determine if dinoseb impaired locomotor activity. Dinoseb decreased locomotor activity in 7 dpf larvae but not 6 dpf. This study improves knowledge of toxicity mechanisms for dinoseb in early stages of fish development and demonstrates that mitochondrial toxicants may disrupt immune signaling in zebrafish.

TI  - Comparative study on the susceptibility of freshwater species to copper-based pesticides.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Copper compounds have been intentionally introduced into water bodies as aquatic plant herbicides, algicides and molluscicides. Copper-based fertilizers and fungicides have been widely used in agriculture as well. Despite the fact that copper is an essential element for all biota, elevated concentrations of this metal have been shown to affect a variety of aquatic organisms. Nonetheless, comparative studies on the susceptibility of different freshwater species to copper compounds have seldom been performed. This study was conducted to compare toxicity of copper-based pesticides (copper oxychloride, cuprous oxide and copper sulfate) to different freshwater target (Raphidocelis subcapitata, a planktonic alga and Biomphalaria glabrata, a snail) and non-target (Daphnia similis, a planktonic crustacean and Danio rerio, a fish) organisms. Test water parameters were as follows: pH = 7.4 +/- 0.1; hardness 44 +/- 1 mg/l as CaCO3; DO 8-9 mg/l at the beginning and \textgreater 4 mg/l at the end; temperature, fish and snails 25 +/- 1 degrees C, Daphnia 20 +/- 2 degrees C, algae 24 +/- 1 degrees C. D. similis (immobilization), 48-h EC50s (95% CLs) ranging from 0.013 (0.011-0.016) to 0.043 (0.033-0.057) mg Cu/l, and R. subcapitata (growth inhibition), 96-h IC50s from 0.071 (0.045-0.099) to 0.137 (0.090-0.174) mg Cu/l, were the most susceptible species. B. glabrata (lethality), 48-h LC50s from 0.179 (0.102-0.270) to 0.854 (0.553-1.457) mg Cu/l, and D. rerio (lethality), 48-h LC50s 0.063 (0.045-0.089), 0.192 (0.133-0.272) and 0.714 (0.494-1.016) mg Cu/l, were less susceptible than Daphnia to copper-based pesticides. Findings from the present study therefore suggest that increased levels of copper in water bodies is likely to adversely affect a variety of aquatic species.

TI  - Enantioselective induction of estrogen-responsive gene expression by permethrin enantiomers in embryo-larval zebrafish.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Enantioselectivity in the separation, toxicology, biodegradation and estrogenic activity of chiral pesticides has become a groundbreaking topic recently. In this study, real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was adapted to investigate the induction of estrogen-responsive gene expression in embryo-larval zebrafish after 7 d of exposure to permethrin (PM) enantiomers. The PM enantiomers were completely separated by a chiral HPLC column. The in vivo study found that a 7 d exposure to 250 ng L(-1) PM racemate and its enantiomers was sufficient to stimulate vtg1, esralpha and cyp19b expression, while 1000 ng L(-1) exposure significantly induced gene expression in a pattern similar to that of the control (50 ng L(-1) E2), except for vtg2. Significant differences were detected between the enantiomers in the induction of estrogen-responsive gene expression. At the exposure level of 1000 ng L(-1), the vtg1, esralpha and cyp19b responses to the (-)-trans enantiomer were about 3.2-, 1.8- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than those in the group treated with (+)-trans enantiomer (p \textless 0.05). In the two cis-enantiomer treatment groups, (+)-cis increased the mRNA level of the cyp19b gene about 1.5-fold higher than the (-)-cis-enantiomer did. Of the four enantiomers, the (-)-trans enantiomer showed the greatest estrogenic activity. The results strongly indicate the occurrence of significant enantioselectivity in estrogenic activity of PM enantiomers exposed to embryo-larval zebrafish. These findings add to a growing body of evidence concerning enantioselectivity in the toxicity, endocrine-disrupting activity, and environmental biodegradation of chiral pesticides.

TI  - Waterborne exposure to clodinafop-propargyl disrupts the posterior and ventral development of zebrafish embryos.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Clodinafop-propargyl, an aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicide, is widely used for the control of annual grasses. However, research focusing on the ecotoxicity of this herbicide is limited. The present study employed zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to investigate its developmental toxicity. Embryos were exposed to a range of concentrations from 0.2 µM to 5 µM starting at late cleavage stage (2 h postfertilization, [hpf]) or late gastrulation stage (10 hpf). The results showed that the two exposure strategies had the same minimum teratogenic concentration of 0.6 µM but caused different groups of morphogenetic malformations. When exposure was initiated at 2 hpf, clodinafop-propargyl caused various embryonic phenotypes, including embryos with a fin gap in the ventral tail and embryos with coiled tail. When exposure was initiated at 10 hpf, clodinafop-propargyl resulted in failure of the tail to detach, in which the ventral tissues failed to grow out but instead adhered to the yolk extension, and the defect differed to various degrees among embryos. Similar effects were observed for embryos exposed to clodinafop, the metabolite of clodinafop-propargyl. Because these defects were mainly confined to the posterior and ventral region that derived from ventral blastoderm cells, we have evaluated the expression of the ventral mesoderm marker gene gata-1 and ventral ectoderm marker gene gata-3. No significant alteration was seen in gata-1 expression except for the expanded blood islands, whereas the expression of gata-3 was significantly reduced. Our findings showed that clodinafop-propargyl exposure disturbed embryonic patterning and fate specification of ventrally derived gastrula ectoderm cells.

TI  - The effects of carbaryl on the development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Zebrafish
AB  - In the United States, Sevin(™) brand insecticide is one of the most commonly used insecticides. The active ingredient in Sevin(™), carbaryl (1-napthyl-N-methylcarbamate), is a known acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine to acetate and choline at the synapse. While carbaryl successfully causes the death of insects by paralysis, it has also been shown to have negative effects on the development of several nontarget species. To study the effects of carbaryl on nontarget species, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used, as they are a good model for both toxicology and development studies. Our study suggests that carbaryl induces changes in morphology, specifically in embryo size and shape. Additionally, carbaryl causes defects in heart formation that is characterized by a decrease in heart rate and a developmental delay/defect in cardiac looping. A significant decrease in the number of spinal cord neurons present was also observed. Further investigation showed that there was an increase in cell death in carbaryl-treated embryos. The results indicate that carbaryl may have a greater environmental impact than initially intended. Our study, which was conducted solely by undergraduates at a liberal arts college, indicates that carbaryl may be detrimental to the development of nontarget species.

TI  - Effects of butachlor on estrogen receptor, vitellogenin and P450 aromatase gene expression in the early life stage of zebrafish.
T2  - Journal of environmental science and health. Part A, Toxic/hazardous substances & environmental engineering
AB  - Butachlor has adverse effects on fecundity and disrupts sex hormone homeostasis in adult zebrafish, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to various concentrations of butachlor from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 30 days post-fertilization (dpf). The transcription of genes involved estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ1 and ERβ2), vitellogenins (VTG I and II), and cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19a) was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that there was no significant alteration in the expression of VTGI, ERα, ERβ1, ERβ2 and CYP19a after 30 days of butachlor exposure, whereas the transcription of VTG II gene was significantly up-regulated in zebrafish exposed to 100 μg/L butachlor. It is suggested that butachlor may be a weak estrogen, and more endpoints need to be investigated to assess the effects of butachlor on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis of zebrafish.

TI  - Developmental toxic effects of monocrotophos, an organophosphorous pesticide, on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - The present study examined the response of zebrafish embryos exposed to different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg/L) of monocrotophos under static conditions for 96 h. We found that mortality had occurred within 48 h at all test concentrations, later insignificant mortality was observed. Monocrotophos (MCP) can be rated as moderately toxic to the Zebrafish embryos with a 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) of 37.44 ± 3.32 mg/L. In contrast, it greatly affected the development of zebrafish embryos by inducing several developmental abnormalities like pericardial edema, altered heart development, spinal and vertebral anomalies in a concentration-dependent manner. A significant percent reduction in length by 9-48% and heart beats by 18-51% was observed in hatchlings exposed to LC10 and LC50 concentrations at 96 h when compared to controls. The process of looping formation of heart at embryonic stage was greatly affected by the LC50 concentration of MCP. The neurotoxic potentiality of MCP was assessed by using a marker enzyme, acetylcholinesterase in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. MCP was found to be the most potent inhibitor of AChE in vitro with an IC50 value of 4.3 × 10(-4) M. The whole-body AChE enzyme activity in vivo was significantly inhibited during the exposure tenure with the maximum inhibition of 62% at 24 h.

TI  - Toxicokinetics of atrazine in embryos of the zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamine-s-triazine) is a widely used selective herbicide. Due to its persistence, it is present in many surface waters, contaminating nontarget organisms such as fish. Teratogeny of atrazine was examined during the first 48 h of zebrafish development (embryo test) and correlated to effects on the microsomal and soluble glutathione S-transferases (m-/sGST; EC 2.5.1.18). Atrazine at 4 mg/L disturbed the normal development to long pec stage, at concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/L it caused retardations in organogenesis, a slowdown of movements, and functional disturbances of heart and circulatory system. m- and sGST activities were affected by atrazine in all investigated developmental stages. Atrazine elevated the mGST activity dose dependently up to a concentration of 5 mg/L, and the sGST up to 1 mg/L. Higher atrazine concentrations caused a decrease of GST activity, especially of the sGST of the younger stages, 32 cells and 75% epiboly. This might indicate that the detoxication system itself is affected, which then gives rise to morphological abnormalities during fish development. In vitro tests were performed to purify and characterize GST-formed atrazine metabolites by the use of ESI–HPLC–MS. mGST showed higher conversion rates compared to sGST.

TI  - Exposure to sodium metam during zebrafish somitogenesis results in early transcriptional indicators of the ensuing neuronal and muscular dysfunction.
T2  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology
AB  - Exposures to sodium metam (NaM) within the developmental period of somitogenesis (10- to 18-h postfertilization [hpf]) results in easily detectable distortions of the notochord by 24 hpf in the developing zebrafish. We hypothesized that NaM-induced transcriptional changes during somitogenesis would reveal the major molecular targets in the zebrafish embryo. Embryos were exposed to NaM beginning at 4 hpf (1000 cells) and total RNA was isolated from embryos at the 3 somite (11 hpf), 10 somite (14 hpf), 18 somite (18 hpf), and larval (24 hpf) stages of development. Using the Affymetrix zebrafish gene array we observed relatively few mRNAs differentially regulated at least twofold at each time point (11 hpf, 101 genes; 14 hpf, 151; 18 hpf, 154; 24 hpf, 33). The transcriptional profiles reveal neurodevelopment and myogenesis as the two primary targets of NaM developmental exposure. Quantitative PCR of several muscle and neuronal genes confirmed the array response. We also followed the structural development of the peripheral nervous system under NaM exposure using antibodies against neuronal structural proteins. Although there was no change in the onset of antibody staining, profound alterations became apparent during the period in which the notochord becomes distorted (\textgreater 18 hpf). Motor neuron development observed with the Tg(NBT:MAPT-GFP)zc1 transgenic zebrafish and a primary motor neuron specific antibody showed similar timing in the structural alterations observed in these cell types. Further study of the interactions of dithiocarbamates with the regulatory elements of fast muscle development and neurodevelopment is warranted.

TI  - Dichlorvos exposure results in large scale disruption of energy metabolism in the liver of the zebrafish, Danio rerio.
T2  - BMC genomics
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphorus pesticide, is known to result in neurotoxicity as well as other metabolic perturbations. However, the molecular causes of DDVP toxicity are poorly understood, especially in cells other than neurons and muscle cells. To obtain a better understanding of the process of non-neuronal DDVP toxicity, we exposed zebrafish to different concentrations of DDVP, and investigated the resulting changes in liver histology and gene transcription. RESULTS: Functional enrichment analysis of genes affected by DDVP exposure identified a number of processes involved in energy utilization and stress response in the liver. The abundance of transcripts for proteins involved in glucose metabolism was profoundly affected, suggesting that carbon flux might be diverted toward the pentose phosphate pathway to compensate for an elevated demand for energy and reducing equivalents for detoxification. Strikingly, many transcripts for molecules involved in β-oxidation and fatty acid synthesis were down-regulated. We found increases in message levels for molecules involved in reactive oxygen species responses as well as ubiquitination, proteasomal degradation, and autophagy. To ensure that the effects of DDVP on energy metabolism were not simply a consequence of poor feeding because of neuromuscular impairment, we fasted fish for 29 or 50 h and analyzed liver gene expression in them. The patterns of gene expression for energy metabolism in fasted and DDVP-exposed fish were markedly different. CONCLUSION: We observed coordinated changes in the expression of a large number of genes involved in energy metabolism and responses to oxidative stress. These results argue that an appreciable part of the effect of DDVP is on energy metabolism and is regulated at the message level. Although we observed some evidence of neuromuscular impairment in exposed fish that may have resulted in reduced feeding, the alterations in gene expression in exposed fish cannot readily be explained by nutrient deprivation.

T2  - Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - Atrazine (ATZ), the most common herbicide, is a frequently observed contaminant in freshwater ecosystems. In the present study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight-mass spectrometry, combined with histopathological analysis, were used to detect the hepatic damage in adult female zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to ATZ. More than 600 hepatic protein spots were detected in each gel with silver staining, and most of the proteins ranged from 20 to 70 kD and pH 4-9. Through comparison and analysis, 7 proteins were found to be upregulated\textgreater2-fold, whereas 6 protein spots were downregulated\textgreater2-fold after 10 and 1000 μg/l ATZ exposures for 14 days, which had caused histological effects in zebrafish livers. We found that these changed proteins were associated with a variety of cellular biological processes, such as response to oxidative stress, oncogenesis, etc. The results demonstrated that ATZ comprehensively influenced a variety of cellular and biological processes in zebrafish. The information presented in this study will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of the potential effects induced by ATZ in fish.

TI  - Subacute developmental exposure of zebrafish to the organophosphate pesticide metabolite, chlorpyrifos-oxon, results in defects in Rohon-Beard sensory neuron development.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are environmental toxicants known to inhibit the catalytic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) resulting in hypercholinergic toxicity symptoms. In developing embryos, OPs have been hypothesized to affect both cholinergic and non-cholinergic pathways. In order to understand the neurological pathways affected by OP exposure during embryogenesis, we developed a subacute model of OP developmental exposure in zebrafish by exposing embryos to a dose of the OP metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) that is non-lethal and significantly inhibited AChE enzymatic activity compared to control embryos (43% at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) and 11% at 2dpf). Phenotypic analysis of CPO-exposed embryos demonstrated that embryonic growth, as analyzed by gross morphology, was normal in 85% of treated embryos. Muscle fiber formation was similar to control embryos as analyzed by birefringence, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) cluster formation was quantitatively similar to control embryos as analyzed by α-bungarotoxin staining. These results indicate that partial AChE activity during the early days of zebrafish development is sufficient for general development, muscle fiber, and nAChR development. Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons exhibited aberrant peripheral axon extension and gene expression profiling suggests that several genes responsible for RB neurogenesis are down-regulated. Stability of CPO in egg water at 28.5 °C was determined by HPLC-UV-MS analysis which revealed that the CPO concentration used in our studies hydrolyzes in egg water with a half-life of 1 day. The result that developmental CPO exposure affected RB neurogenesis without affecting muscle fiber or nAChR cluster formation demonstrates that zebrafish are a strong model system for characterizing subtle neurological pathologies resulting from environmental toxicants.

T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Edge-of-field waterbodies in tropical agroecosystems have been reported to be especially prone to pesticide contamination through runoff resulting from intensive irrigation practices and tropical rainfall. In the present study, the effects of runoff from an experimental agricultural field applied with Vertimec(®) 18EC (active ingredient: abamectin) on zebrafish were evaluated. To this end, the experimental field was applied with the Vertimec(®) 18EC dose recommended for strawberry crop in Brazil, whereas another field was treated with water only to serve as control. No effects of runoff water from either plot were recorded on survival. Water from the treated field led to increased growth and gill alterations. In general, these alterations were of the first and second degree, including proliferation of cells between the secondary lamellae, dilation at the lamellar apex, detachment of the respiratory epithelium and aneurism. These results confirm the high toxic potential of Vertimec(®) 18EC and provide evidence that environmental risks are likely to occur in areas subject to runoff containing this pesticide.

AB  - In this study, zebrafish was exposed to environmental levels of triadimefon (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μg/mL) from 24 h post fertilization to 120 days post fertilization. Several endpoints that related to reproductive function were evaluated. It was found that the body length, body weight and vitellogenin transcription were significantly reduced for fish exposed to triadimefon. Histological examination showed that the sex ratio of fish skewed to male and female exposed to 0.5 μg/mL triadimefon had immature ovary. The breeding success, as determined from data on egg production and spawning, was reduced in fish exposed to 0.25 μg/mL triadimefon. In the offspring, the reduced egg fertility, hatching rate and survival were observed in eggs exposed to 0.5 μg/mL triadimefon. These findings indicated that triadimefon had the potential to adversely affect the sexual development and breeding success through the multiple endocrine actions.

TI  - Effects of the fungicide prochloraz on the sexual development of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Some chemicals have the potential to adversely affect sexual development through multiple endocrine actions. Prochloraz is an imidazole fungicide that displays diverse mechanisms of action, including inhibition of aromatase activity, inhibition of androgen synthesis, and antagonism of the androgen receptor. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of prochloraz on the sexual development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT) proposed as an OECD test guideline for detection of endocrine disruptors. Zebrafish were exposed to prochloraz (0, 16, 64 or 202 microg/L) for 60 days from 24 h post fertilization. Fish exposed to 202 microg/L prochloraz showed an increased proportion of males. Furthermore, the incidence of intersex and the stages of the gonads were altered in the treated fish compared to the control fish. A significant vitellogenin decrease was observed in both female and male zebrafish at an exposure concentration of 202 microg/L prochloraz. However, in the male fish, significantly increased vitellogenin concentrations were observed in the groups exposed to 16 or 64 microg/L prochloraz. This study serves as a part of the validation of the FSDT and indicates that the FSDT is suitable in detecting compounds with multiple endocrine actions. This is of importance in the assessment of the potential risk of existing and new chemicals.

TI  - Effect of sublethal α-cypermethrin exposure on main macromolecules concentration, energy content, and malondialdehyde concentration in free-feeding Danio rerio larvae.
T2  - Fish physiology and biochemistry
AB  - α-Cypermethrin (Cyp) is a synthetic insecticide used to control pests in agricultural crops and to protect human health against noxious insects; this toxic can reach aquatic systems through ground infiltration or by runoff and could affect the aquatic biota. The present study was aimed at evaluating the acute toxicity of Cyp on zebrafish (Danio rerio) exogenous feeding larvae of 10 and 20 days post-fertilization (dpf), and of sublethal concentrations on only 10-dpf larvae. Proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, glycogen concentration, and total energy contents, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification, through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, as a lipid peroxidation biomarker, were assessed in free-feeding larvae exposed to sublethal Cyp concentrations. The LC50 for 10-dpf larvae was 1.94 µg L(-1), and these were more sensitive than 20-dpf larvae (3.56 µg L(-1)). The amount of protein, carbohydrates, and glycogen were not significantly affected (p \textgreater 0.05), but sublethal Cyp concentrations exposure caused decrement in lipids from 9.05 to 3.74 µg larva(-1), as well as a reduction in MDA and in the total energy content, which affected significantly the development of this fish. Although Cyp is considered an insecticide of reduced residual effect in the environment, the present study revealed that relatively low Cyp concentrations produced significant toxic effects on exogenous feeding fish larvae, a situation that could contribute to increase deaths during this already critical developmental stage in which high mortality is observed frequently.

TI  - Impairment of the cortisol stress response mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to monocrotophos pesticide.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - In teleosts, an important component of the stress response is coordinated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis. Environmental contaminants might disrupt the stress axis and consequently affect the stress response in fish. To investigate the effect of monocrotophos (MCP) pesticide on the stress response of fish and its potential mechanisms, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100μg/L of a 40% MCP-based pesticide for 21d, after which time fish were subjected to a 3-min air-exposure stressor. Concentrations of the whole-body cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay and abundances of transcripts of proteins involved in the HPI axis were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that 100μg/L of MCP pesticide decreased whole-body cortisol levels of female zebrafish in response to an acute stressor, but without any effect on the cortisol response in males. 100μg/L MCP pesticide reduced POMC and GR expression in the brain, MC2R and P45011β expression in the head kidney, but enhanced 20β-HSD2 expression in the head kidney, suggesting that MCP damaged the HPI axis involving acting at pituitary regulatory levels, inhibiting cortisol synthesis and stimulating cortisol catabolism, or disturbing the negative feedback regulation. Additionally, MCP depressed liver GR transcription but did not affect phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and tyrosine aminotransferase expression in zebrafish, suggesting a role for this pesticide in reducing target tissue responsiveness to cortisol. Considered together, the reduced ability to elevate cortisol levels in response to an acute stress may be an endocrine dysfunction occurring in zebrafish subchronically exposed to MCP pesticide.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibition and increased food consumption rate in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, after chronic exposure to parathion.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is widely regarded as a good biomarker of exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OP). However, less is known about the relationship between AChE inhibition and consequences for growth, reproduction and survival on organisms. Acute toxicity tests with fish have shown that high percentages of AChE inhibition are needed to cause detrimental effects, but not much is known about the consequences of chronic exposure to this group of chemicals for both AChE activity and higher levels of biological organisation. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the OP parathion for 250 days in a flow-through system. Besides AChE activity, a variety of other parameters were measured: whole-body protein and lactate content, consumption rate, survival, growth and reproduction. AChE inhibition was correlated with exposure concentration, but not with exposure time, and was significant above 0.9 microg/l after 144 days and above 4.3 microg/l after 250 days of exposure. Both parathion and the cosolvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) significantly increased food consumption rate of the fish. Survival, growth, reproduction and lactate content were not affected, while protein concentrations showed only minor effects. These findings support the hypothesis that AChE is a very sensitive biomarker for exposure, but not accurately predict higher level adverse effects following long-term exposure to OPs.

TI  - Terbutryn toxicity to Danio rerio: effects of subchronic exposure on fish growth.
T2  - Neuro endocrinology letters
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate effects of subchronic exposure to sublethal levels of terbutryn on growth and on histopathological changes in Danio rerio. DESIGN: The acute toxicity tests were performed on the juvenile stage of Danio rerio according to OECD No. 203 Fish, Acute Toxicity Test. The juvenile growth tests were performed on D. rerio according to the OECD method No. 215. Fish at the age of 20 days were exposed to the terbutryn environmental concentration commonly detected in the Czech rivers (0.02 microg L-1) and the range of sublethal concentrations of terbutryn (0.06, 0.2, 0.6 and 2 mg L-1) for 28 days. RESULTS: The 96hLC50 terbutryn mean value for the juvenile stage of D. rerio was 5.71 +/- 0.46 mg L-1. A significant decrease (p \textless 0.01) in the fish growth caused by terbutryn was observed in the concentration of 0.6 mg L-1. The value of NOEC was 0.2 mg L-1 and LOEC was 0.6 mg L-1 of terbutryn. We found the damage to tubular system of kidneys in the concentration of 0.6 mg L-1 of terbutryn. CONCLUSION: The environmental concentration of terbutryn in the Czech rivers did not have any effects on growth and on histopathological changes in D. rerio and this concentration is lower than determined LOEC and NOEC values of terbutryn.

TI  - Chemical class-specific gene expression changes in the zebrafish embryo after exposure to glycol ether alkoxy acids and 1,2,4-triazole antifungals.
T2  - Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)
AB  - The zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) is an alternative test to predict embryotoxicity of substances based on morphological assessment. Implementing transcriptomics may increase sensitivity and objectivity of the test system. We applied the category approach to compare effects of compounds from two chemical classes, the glycol ethers and 1,2,4-triazoles, on the embryo. At 24h post fertilization, microarray analysis revealed several thousands of responsive genes after glycol ether exposure, whereas the triazoles significantly regulated only several hundreds of genes. Principal component analysis of the genes commonly regulated per chemical class demonstrated that the two classes can be distinguished. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that after glycol ether exposure mainly gene sets related to development were downregulated. After triazole exposure, gene sets corresponding to previously described mechanisms of action, such as glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism were regulated. Our results demonstrate that transcriptomics in the ZET provides a more sensitive endpoint than standard morphological assessment. In addition, information about mechanisms of action of substances may become available, thereby facilitating the extrapolation of findings to mammalian species including man.

AB  - This paper deals with the impact of a complex pollution system composed of a very toxic carbamate pesticide, aldicarb and the widely used anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate(SDBS), on DNA of zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) embryo. The results indicated that DNA damage caused by aldicarb became more serious with its increasing concentration, but single-strand break caused by aldicarb in low concentration and short time could be repaired, and high concentration led to double-strand break which was difficult to repaire. SDBS in certain concentration (20 mg.L-1) could reduce the toxicity of aldicarb in the complex pollution system.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of methyl parathion-responsive proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Methyl parathion (MP), an organophosphorus pesticide used worldwide, has been associated with a wide spectrum of toxic effects on organisms in the environment. This study set out to analyze the alteration of protein profiles in MP-exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain and find the proteins responsive to MP toxicity. Zebrafish were subjected to 1, 3 and 5mg/L MP and the proteomic changes in their brains were revealed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Six protein spots were observed to be significantly changed by MP exposure. Among these, 4 spots were down-regulated, while 2 spots were up-regulated. These altered spots were excised from the gels and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and database searching. The results indicate that these proteins were involved in binding, catalysis, regulation of energy metabolism and cell structure. These data may provide novel biomarkers for the evaluation of MP contamination and useful insights for understanding the mechanisms of MP toxicity.

TI  - Ketogenic therapy for Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and synthesis without meta-analysis of animal and human trials
AB  - Objective: The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the efficacy of ketogenic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD), using all available data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on humans and animal studies with PD models. Design: Systematic review of in vivo studies. Methods: Studies related to the research question were identified through searches in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov and the gray literature, from inception until November 2021. Rayyan was employed to screen and identify all studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Cochrane's revised Risk of Bias 2.0 and SYRCLE tools evaluated bias in RCTs and animal studies, respectively. An effect direction plot was developed to synthesize the evidence of the RCTs. Results: Twelve studies were identified and included in the qualitative synthesis (4 RCTs and 8 animal trials). Interventions included ketogenic diets (KDs), supplementation with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, caprylic acid administration and ketone ester drinks. The animal research used zebrafish and rodents, and PD was toxin-induced. Based on the available RCTs, ketogenic therapy does not improve motor coordination and functioning, cognitive impairment, anthropometrics, blood lipids and glycemic control, exercise performance or voice disorders in patients with PD. The evidence is scattered and heterogenous, with single trials assessing different outcomes; thus, a synthesis of the evidence cannot be conclusive regarding the efficacy of ketogenic therapy. On the other hand, animal studies tend to demonstrate more promising results, with marked improvements in locomotor activity, dopaminergic activity, redox status, and inflammatory markers. Conclusions: Although animal studies indicate promising results, research on the effect of ketogenic therapy in PD is still in its infancy, with RCTs conducted on humans being heterogeneous and lacking PD-specific outcomes. More studies are required to recommend or refute the use of ketogenic therapy in PD. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF BACOPA MONNIERI IN TREATING PARKINSON’S DISEASE
AB  - Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disease that affect the dopamine system in the brain which is responsible for the motor control of the body. Presently, drugs that is commercially available have unwanted side effects. Bacopa monnieri is known to have many positive effects such as strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, nonetheless, there is insufficient details regarding the effects toward this disease. Zebrafish is a reliable model to study neurological disease with the induction of rotenone. Rotenone cause effects toward zebrafish identical to Parkinson’s disease. Thus, the aim of this study is to study the effects of Bacopa monnieri toward rotenone induced zebrafish. 50 adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were separated into three groups. Group 1: Normal group (n=10), Group 2: Negative group (n=20), Group 3: Experimental group (n=20). The adult zebrafish were exposed to 5 μg/L rotenone for 28 days following with the treatment for 28 days using Bacopa monnieri with the concentration of 0.2348 mg/L. Lethal concentration (LC50) has been observed in 0.2348 mg/L treatment. Behaviour finding indicate that the adult zebrafish shows anxious response by measuring the time spent by the fish at the lower region of the tank. The fish also display slow swimming pattern after induced with rotenone, but it showed significant increased after the treatment. The increased swimming activity might be due to the antioxidant and therapeutic effects of Bacopa monnieri that significantly changed the behaviour of zebrafish. In conclusion, we found that Bacopa monnieri extract exhibits strong potential in treating Parkinson’s disease-induced zebrafish. © 2022, Medico Legal Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - 3-Pyridinylboronic Acid Ameliorates Rotenone-Induced Oxidative Stress Through Nrf2 Target Genes in Zebrafish Embryos
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative diseases and research on potential therapeutic agents for PD continues. Rotenone is a neurotoxin that can pass the blood–brain barrier and is used to generate PD models in experimental animals. Boron is a microelement necessary for neural activity in the brain. Antioxidant, non-cytotoxic, anti-genotoxic, anti-carcinogenic effects of boric acid, the salt compound of boron has been reported before. Boronic acids have been approved for treatment by FDA and are included in drug discovery studies and pyridine boronic acids are a subclass of heterocyclic boronic acids used in drug design and discovery as substituted pyridines based on crystal engineering principles. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of 3-pyridinylboronic acid in rotenone-exposed zebrafish embryos, focusing on oxidant-antioxidant parameters and gene expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target genes gclm, gclc, hmox1a, nqo1, and PD related genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dj1, and tnfα. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to Rotenone (10 μg/l); Low Dose 3-Pyridinylboronic acid (100 μM); High Dose 3-Pyridinylboronic acid (200 μM); Rotenone + Low Dose-3-Pyridinylboronic acid (10 μg/l + 100 μM); Rotenone + High Dose-3-Pyridinylboronic acid (10 μg/l + 200 μM) in well plates for 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). Our study showed for the first time that 3-pyridinylboronic acid, as a novel sub-class of the heterocyclic boronic acid compound, improved locomotor activities, ameliorated oxidant-antioxidant status by decreasing LPO and NO levels, and normalized the expressions of bdnf, dj1, tnf⍺ and Nrf2 target genes hmox1a and nqo1 in rotenone exposed zebrafish embryos. On the other hand, it caused the deterioration of the oxidant-antioxidant balance in the control group through increased lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide levels, and decreased antioxidant enzymes. We believe that these results should be interpreted in the context of the dose-toxicity and benefit-harm relationship of the effects of 3-pyridinylboronic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Antagonistic effects and mechanisms of carbendazim and chlorpyrifos on the neurobehavior of larval zebrafish
AB  - Residues from multiple pesticides are frequently detected on vegetables, which may produce combined toxicity not predicted by individual toxicity data. As these combined effects present additional dangers to food safety, we have compared individual to combined effects for a variety of pesticides. Carbendazim and chlorpyrifos are the two most commonly detected pesticides in vegetables, and previous studies reported that combined exposure results in synergistic developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos. In this study, individual and combined effects on zebrafish motor activity were examined following individual and combined exposure to assess nervous system toxicity. Further, transcriptomics methods were used to identify potential molecular mechanisms for individual and combined toxicity. Carbendazim alone induced a disorganized swim pattern characterized by increased angular velocity, turn angle, meander, and acceleration during light-dark transition, while chlorpyrifos alone reduced average swim speed and light-dark acceleration. Combined treatment significantly reduced average swim velocity and total distance traveled. Combination indices indicated strong antagonism between compounds for average speed and light-dark acceleration. Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) showed that carbendazim significantly altered the expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism, including ctslb, cyp7a1, hsp70l, and ugt1a1. Alternatively, chlorpyrifos significantly altered genes involved in various nervous system-related pathways, including glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and calcium signaling. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis suggested that chlorpyrifos significantly downregulated genes related to light transduction, resulting in decreased sensitivity to light-dark transitions, while antagonism mainly reflected divergent effects on phototransduction and retinol metabolism. Carbendazim had no significant effects on vision-related genes such as gnat1 and gngt1, while chlorpyrifos downregulated expression, an effect reversed by the combination. Comprehensive toxicity analyses must include joint effects of co-applied pesticides for enhanced food safety. © 2022

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to various environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides during two critical windows, 0-5 days post fertilization (dpf) throughout embryogenesis and 4-5 dpf at early larval development. The toxicity of each chemical and concentration was then determined by evaluating developmental abnormalities, behavioral alterations, and transcriptomic changes. We found the most significant outcomes resulted from dieldrin exposures as low as 1 nM at 0-5 dpf, or 0.1 nM at 4−5 dpf, including abnormalities in skeleton, swim bladder, and yolk sec, as well as hyperactive behavioral phenotypes. Following dieldrin exposures at higher concentrations, 100 nM at 0-5 dpf and 1000 nM at 4−5 dpf, we observed startle movements at the transition between light and dark stimulus. The transcriptomic changes of high-level dieldrin exposures (1000 nM) implicated movement or seizure disorders. Atrazine at concentrations equal or above 100 nM led to underinflated swim bladders following exposure at 0-5 dpf. Both atrazine exposure paradigms showed transcriptomic changes related to neurological disorders and breast cancer. All chlorpyrifos exposures showed no significant morphological abnormalities and the fewest differentially expressed genes, suggesting chlorpyrifos at 0.01-100 nM exhibited the lowest toxicity among these three pesticides. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Overview and New Insights Into the Diversity, Evolution, Role, and Regulation of Kisspeptins and Their Receptors in Teleost Fish
AB  - In the last two decades, kisspeptin (Kiss) has been identified as an important player in the regulation of reproduction and other physiological functions in vertebrates, including several fish species. To date, two ligands (Kiss1, Kiss2) and three kisspeptin receptors (Kissr1, Kissr2, Kissr3) have been identified in teleosts, likely due to whole-genome duplication and loss of genes that occurred early in teleost evolution. Recent results in zebrafish and medaka mutants have challenged the notion that the kisspeptin system is essential for reproduction in fish, in marked contrast to the situation in mammals. In this context, this review focuses on the role of kisspeptins at three levels of the reproductive, brain-pituitary-gonadal (BPG) axis in fish. In addition, this review compiled information on factors controlling the Kiss/Kissr system, such as photoperiod, temperature, nutritional status, sex steroids, neuropeptides, and others. In this article, we summarize the available information on the molecular diversity and evolution, tissue expression and neuroanatomical distribution, functional significance, signaling pathways, and gene regulation of Kiss and Kissr in teleost fishes. Of particular note are recent advances in understanding flatfish kisspeptin systems, which require further study to reveal their structural and functional diversity.

TI  - Effects of common environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals on zebrafish behavior
AB  - Environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a type of exogenous organic pollutants, are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments. Therefor, this review focused on the use of the zebrafish as a model to explore the effect of different EDCs on behavior, as well as the molecular mechanisms that drive these effects. Furthermore, our study summarizes the current knowledge on the neuromodulatory effects of different EDCs in zebrafish. This study also reviews the current state of zebrafish behavior research, in addition to the potential mechanisms of single and mixed pollutant-driven behavioral dysregulation at the molecular level, as well as the applications of zebrafish behavior experiments for neuroscience research. This review broadens our understanding of the influence of EDCs on zebrafish behavior and provides guidance for future research. © 2021

TI  - Estrogen receptor: A potential linker of estrogenic and dopaminergic pathways in zebrafish larvae following deltamethrin exposure
AB  - Deltamethrin (DM), a type II pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used to control agricultural pests. However, its excessive use exerts a detrimental effect on the ecological environment and human health, indicating the need to study its potential risks in detail. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to varying concentrations of DM (0.1, 1, 10, and 25 μg/L) for 96 h to assess the alterations in the transcript levels of proteins of the estrogenic and dopaminergic pathways. In addition, its effect on zebrafish locomotor activity was studied. The mRNA expression of cyp19a1b, erα, erβ2, fshr, gnrh2, gnrhr3, vtg3, dat, and dr1 significantly changed after exposing the embryos to DM. Deltamethrin at 10 and 25 μg/L significantly reduced the average swimming speed of zebrafish larvae. In addition, embryos injected with zebrafish estrogen receptor α (erα) and β (erβ) morpholinos and co-exposed to 25 μg/L DM for 96 h showed reduced expression of vtg3 mRNA compared to embryos exposed to 25 μg/L DM only. The locomotor activity of erα and erβ knockdown zebrafish following DM exposure was increased significantly when compared with that of larvae exposed to 25 μg/L DM only. Our results demonstrated that DM altered the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae and the transcript levels of the components of estrogenic and dopaminergic pathways; erα and erβ knockdown weakened these effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rifampicin decreases neuroinflammation to maintain mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in rotenone-treated zebrafish
AB  - Among the mechanisms underlying Parkinson’s disease, many pathogenic mechanisms are suggested to be effective such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and neuroinflammation. Calcium is very important for neuronal and glial cells, neurodegenerative disease mechanisms are closely related to disturbed calcium homeostasis. Recent studies strongly support the role of inflammation in nigrostriatal degeneration in PD. In recent years, Rifampicin, a macrocyclic antibiotic has been shown to have a protective effect on neurons. This study aims to evaluate the effects of rifampicin in the experimental PD model induced by rotenone in zebrafish focusing on the relationship between calcium-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Adult zebrafish were exposed to rotenone and rifampicin for 3 weeks. Locomotor activity was determined as the total distance that the zebrafish traveled for 5 min. Neuroinflammation and PD-related gene expressions were determined by RT-PCR. Mitochondrial calcium levels were determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Gamma synuclein, Park 7, Sigma-1 receptor expressions were determined by Western Blot. Our results show that rifampicin may be effective in reducing neuroinflammation, which may be an effective strategy to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired calcium homeostasis in PD. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Performance study of a magnetic iron–copper bimetallic material for the removal of an environmental “cocktail” of diverse hazardous organic micropollutants from aqueous samples
AB  - Recalcitrant organic compounds are common in the environment and give rise to a serious threat to the ecosystem and human health. Single- or binary-micropollutant systems in the form of aqueous solutions are desirable to study the effect of the experimental parameters and removal capacities of materials for decontamination purposes, in laboratory experiments. However, when it comes to real-life aqueous systems polluted with more than one dissimilarly acting organic substances, the behavior of the materials may vary widely, depending on the nature of each substance. The study herein focuses on evaluating a magnetic Fe–Cu bimetallic nanomaterial in relation to its removal ability, employing a mixture of organic micropollutants from four chemical classes, as model micropollutants: four pesticides, two benzophenones, one nitrophenol, and one pharmaceutical compound. Based on the above, this research investigated (1) the role of synthesis conditions of Fe-Cu on the removal efficiency of the mixture of micropollutants, (2) the influence of several parameters on the removal performance including pH value, ionic strength, sample volume, sorbent mass, stirring rate, and time, and (3) the intrinsic mechanism(s) of removal of the mixtures of micropollutants. The optimal experimental conditions were identified and the involvement of sorption and degradation of the individual pollutants, to a different degree, were demonstrated. The combined action of each single metallic component of the bimetallic material was propitious to remove all substances in the highest yield. Apart from the batch conditions, a simple column elution study was also carried out. The treated mixture of the micropollutants was assessed in terms of its toxicity on zebrafish larvae to appraise its suitability for final discharge. The application of the procedure to a wastewater sample testified that the removal properties of Fe–Cu for the mixture of micropollutants are exploitable. The total removal yields from a treated wastewater and an aqueous standard solution were 88 ± 4% and 92 ± 4%, respectively.

TI  - Exploiting pyocyanin to treat mitochondrial disease due to respiratory complex III dysfunction
AB  - Mitochondrial diseases impair oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, while effective treatment is still lacking. Defective complex III is associated with a highly variable clinical spectrum. We show that pyocyanin, a bacterial redox cycler, can replace the redox functions of complex III, acting as an electron shunt. Sub-μM pyocyanin was harmless, restored respiration and increased ATP production in fibroblasts from five patients harboring pathogenic mutations in TTC19, BCS1L or LYRM7, involved in assembly/stabilization of complex III. Pyocyanin normalized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and mildly increased ROS production and biogenesis. These in vitro effects were confirmed in both DrosophilaTTC19KO and in Danio rerioTTC19KD, as administration of low concentrations of pyocyanin significantly ameliorated movement proficiency. Importantly, daily administration of pyocyanin for two months was not toxic in control mice. Our results point to utilization of redox cyclers for therapy of complex III disorders. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Sdhi fungicide toxicity and associated adverse outcome pathways: What can zebrafish tell us?
AB  - Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides are increasingly used in agriculture to combat molds and fungi, two major threats to both food supply and public health. However, the essential requirement for the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex—the molecular target of SDHIs—in energy metabolism for almost all extant eukaryotes and the lack of species specificity of these fungicides raise concerns about their toxicity toward off‐target organisms and, more generally, toward the environment. Herein we review the current knowledge on the toxicity toward zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) of nine commonly used SDHI fungicides: bixafen, boscalid, fluxapyroxad, flutolanil, isoflucypram, isopyrazam, penthiopyrad, sedaxane, and thifluzamide. The results indicate that these SDHIs cause multiple adverse effects in embryos, larvae/juveniles, and/or adults, sometimes at developmentally relevant concentrations. Adverse effects include developmental toxicity, cardiovascular abnormalities, liver and kidney damage, oxidative stress, energy deficits, changes in metabolism, microcephaly, axon growth defects, apoptosis, and transcriptome changes, suggesting that glycometabolism deficit, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are critical in the toxicity of most of these SDHIs. However, other adverse outcome pathways, possibly involving unsuspected molecular targets, are also suggested. Lastly, we note that because of their recent arrival on the market, the number of studies addressing the toxicity of these compounds is still scant, emphasizing the need to further investigate the toxicity of all SDHIs currently used and to identify their adverse effects and associated modes of action, both alone and in combination with other pesticides. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - An investigation into the biological effects of indirect potable reuse water using zebrafish embryos
AB  - Advanced treatment technologies are being assessed as a proactive measure to assist with the transformation of treated wastewater into a source of water for potable water production. We investigated the biological effects along an advanced water treatment pilot plant, using zebrafish embryos throughout early development. The study compared phenotypic observations with global transcriptome responses, enabling us to keep an open mind about the chemicals that might influence the biological activity. There was no evidence of acute toxicity at any treatment stage, but skeletal, cardiovascular and pigmentation changes occurred in a small proportion of embryos along the treatment process, and in a tap water; not detected in the aquarium water control. Reverse osmosis (RO) reduced the concentration of measured chemical contaminants in the water the most, while eliminating the occurrence of abnormalities detected in fish embryos. Conversely, advanced oxidation reversed the benefits of RO treatment by increasing the frequency of teratogenic and sub-lethal abnormalities seen. Using the molecular responses of zebrafish embryos to different IPR water, we report the bioactivity within the water at different stages of advanced treatment and associate these to perturbed biological functions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations to the retinoid system, which was consistent with the observed teratogenic effects. Changes to tryptophan metabolism (associated with the production of melatonin required for the control of normal circadian rhythms) and somatolactin-beta (associated with normal pigmentation in fish) were also found. We show that underexplored forms of biological activity occur in treated wastewater effluent, and/or may be created depending on the type of advanced treatment process used. By integrating the available analytical chemistry we highlight chemical groups associated to this response. Our study shows that more detailed and in-depth characterisation of chemicals and biological pathways associated with advanced treatment water systems are needed to mitigate possible risks to downstream organisms. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Chlorinated disinfection byproducts of diazepam perturb cell metabolism and induce behavioral toxicity in zebrafish larvae
AB  - Numerous byproducts resulting from chlorinated disinfection are constantly being generated during water treatment processes. The potential risks of these new emerging pollutions remain largely unknown. Here, we determined the risks of chlorinated disinfection byproducts of diazepam (DZP) in the cellular and zebrafish exposure experiments. The cytotoxicity of disinfection byproducts (MACB and MBCC) was greater than DZP in macrophage raw 264.7 cells at 10 mg/L. We further found that the effects of MBCC on the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine and riboflavin were far greater than DZP by the targeted metabolomics methods. Moreover, MBCC significantly decreased the peak amplitude of neuronal action potential in primary embryonic rat (Spragu-Dawley SD) hippocampal neurons. We finally determined behavioral toxicity of DZP and byproducts in zebrafish larvae. MBCC significantly decreased the maximal swim-activity and peak duration of zebrafish after 72 h exposure. Altogether, these findings indicate the MBCC pose serious pressures on public health. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Cerebroventricular Microinjections of MPTP on Adult Zebrafish Induces Dopaminergic Neuronal Death, Mitochondrial Fragmentation, and Sensorimotor Impairments
AB  - Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that mediate the energetic supply to cells and mitigate oxidative stress through the intricate balance of fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature within Parkinson disease (PD) etiologies. To date, there have been conflicting studies of neurotoxin impact on dopaminergic cell death, mitochondrial function and behavioral impairment using adult zebrafish. Here, we performed cerebroventricular microinjections (CVMIs) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on adult transgenic zebrafish that resulted in significant reductions in dopaminergic neurons within the telencephalon and olfactory bulbs (OB) of Tg(dat:eGFP) fish. Visualization of mCherry and mitochondrial gene expression analysis in Tg(dat:tom20 MLS:mCherry) fish reveal that MPTP induces mitochondrial fragmentation in dopaminergic neurons and the activation of the pink1/parkin pathway involved mitophagy. Moreover, the loss of dopaminergic neurons translated into a transient locomotor and olfactory phenotype. Taken together, these data can contribute to a better understanding of the mitochondrial impact on dopaminergic survivability. © Copyright © 2021 Kalyn and Ekker.

TI  - An Antidote Screening System for Organophosphorus Poisoning Using Zebrafish Larvae
AB  - Organophosphorus (OP) cholinesterase inhibitors, which include insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents, are very potent neurotoxicants. Given that the actual treatment has several limitations, the present study provides a general method, called the zebrafish-OP-antidote test (ZOAT), and basic scientific data, to identify new antidotes that are more effective than the reference pyridinium oximes after acute OP poisoning. The reactivation capacity of a chemical compound can be measured using in vivo and ex vivo acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assays. We demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate between chemical compound protective efficacies in the central and peripheral nervous system via the visual motor response and electric field pulse motor response tests, respectively. Moreover, the ability to cross the brain-blood barrier can be estimated in a physiological context by combining an AChE assay on the head and trunk-tail fractions and the cellular and tissue localization of AChE activity in the whole-mount animal. ZOAT is an innovative method suitable for the screening and rapid identification of chemicals and mixtures used as antidote for OP poisoning. The method will make it easier to identify more effective medical countermeasures for chemical threat agents, including combinatorial therapies. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Caprylic acid ameliorates rotenone induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the gut-brain axis in Zebrafish
AB  - Background: Dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the most common non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Pathological processes causing PD were suggested to initiate in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and proceed to the central nervous system (CNS). There are studies showing that low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets can improve motor symptoms of PD. Caprylic acid (C8) is the principal fatty acid component of the medium-chain triglycerides in the ketogenic diets. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of caprylic acid, in neurotoxin exposed zebrafish focusing on the relationship between intestinal and brain oxidative stress and inflammation. Methods: Adult zebrafish were exposed to rotenone (5 μg/L) (R group) and caprylic acid (20 and 60 mg/mL) (L + HDCA and R + HDCA groups) for 30 days. At the end of 30 days locomotor activities were determined. Levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide, glutathione and superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase activities were determined by spectrophotometric methods and gene expressions of tnf⍺, il1, il6, il21, ifnɣ and bdnf were evaluated by RT-PCR in the brain and intestinal tissues of zebrafish. Results: Caprylic acid ameliorated LPO, NO, SOD and the expressions of tnf⍺, il1, il6, il21, ifnɣ and bdnf in brain and intestines. Locomotor activities were only ameliorated in high dose R + HDCA group. Conclusions: Caprylic acid ameliorated the neurotoxin-induced oxidative stress and inflammation both in the brain and intestines and enhanced locomotor activity in zebrafish.

TI  - The Promise of the Zebrafish Model for Parkinson’s Disease: Today’s Science and Tomorrow’s Treatment
AB  - The second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly is Parkinson’s disease (PD). Its etiology is unclear and there are no available disease-modifying medicines. Therefore, more evidence is required concerning its pathogenesis. The use of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is the basis of most animal models of PD. MPTP is metabolized by monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) to MPP + and induces the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in mammals. Zebrafish have been commonly used in developmental biology as a model organism, but owing to its perfect mix of properties, it is now emerging as a model for human diseases. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are cheap and easy to sustain, evolve rapidly, breed transparent embryos in large amounts, and are readily manipulated by different methods, particularly genetic ones. Furthermore, zebrafish are vertebrate species and mammalian findings obtained from zebrafish may be more applicable than those derived from genetic models of invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The resemblance cannot be taken for granted, however. The goal of the present review article is to highlight the promise of zebrafish as a PD animal model. As its aminergic structures, MPTP mode of action, and PINK1 roles mimic those of mammalians, zebrafish seems to be a viable model for studying PD. The roles of zebrafish MAO, however, vary from those of the two types of MAO present in mammals. The benefits unique to zebrafish, such as the ability to perform large-scale genetic or drug screens, should be exploited in future experiments utilizing zebrafish PD models. © Copyright © 2021 Razali, Othman, Mohd Nasir, Doolaanea, Kumar, Ibrahim, Mohamed Ibrahim and Mohamed.

TI  - Neuroprotective Effect of Tephrosia purpurea against Mitochondrial Dysfunction by Regulation of the Caspase3/9 and Pink1/Parkin Complexes
AB  - Background: Tephrosia pupurea is a perennial shrub that has been widely incorporated in Indian traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. Recent studies have identified T. purpurea as a source of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. Aim: In this study, we have established the potential of T. purpurea as a potential source of drugs against Parkinsonism using an oxidopamine (6-OHDA) model. Methods: Metabolomics profiling of T. purpurea extract (TPE) was obtained using the HR-LCMS method. Enzymatic activities of Catalase, Glutathione, Superoxide Dismutase and Malondialdehyde were measured in vitro. Reactive Oxygen Species generation capacity and the mitochondrial membrane potential were also determined. The zebrafish embryos were treated with oxidopamine along with varying concentrations of T. purpurea extract and the swimming pattern and total distance travelled was evaluated. The mRNA expression of mitophagy related genes were measured using RT-PCR studies. Results: The metabolite profile of T. purpurea identified the presence of various polyphenols such as Genistein, Esculetin, and Chrysin that have neuroprotective effects. 6-OHDA-induced PD causes an increase in oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species generation, and affects mitochondrial stability. There was a significant increase in the catalase, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels and a decrease in Malondialdehyde and Reactive Oxygen Species levels in cells treated with TPE when compared to 6-OHDA treated cells. We then treated zebrafish embryos with 6-OHDA along with varying concentrations of T. purpurea extract, and the mRNA expression and swimming pattern were evaluated. The embryos cotreated with TPE showed improved swim pattern similar to untreated embryos, whereas those treated with the positive control failed to do so. T. purpurea extract also significantly decreased the expressions of casp3, casp9, lrrk2, and increased pink1 and parkin expression. Conclusion: Our study identifies Tephrosia purpurea extract as a viable candidate against 6-OHDA induced-neurotoxicity, and further studies of its effect in models of neurodegenerative diseases are required. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

TI  - Water and suspended sediment runoff from vineyard watersheds affecting the behavior and physiology of zebrafish
AB  - Viticulture plays an important role in generating income for small farms globally. Historically, vineyards use large quantities of phytosanitary products, such as Bordeaux mixture [Ca(OH)2 + CuSO4], to control plant diseases. These products result in the accumulation of copper (Cu) in the soil and increases the risk of transfer to water bodies. Thus, it is important to evaluate whether the presence of Cu-bearing particles in water is toxic to aquatic fauna. This study conducted chemical, mineralogical, and particle size evaluations on water samples and sediments collected from a watershed predominantly cultivated with old vineyards. The proportion of Cu-rich nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) in the sediment was 27%. We exposed zebrafish to different dilutions of water and sediment samples that collected directly from the study site (downstream river) under laboratory conditions. Then, we evaluated their exploratory behavior and the stress-related endocrine parameter, whole-body cortisol. We also carried out two experiments in which zebrafish were exposed to Cu. First, we determined the median lethal concentration (LC50–96 h) of Cu and then assessed whether Cu exposure results in effects similar to those associated with exposure to the water and sediment samples collected from the study site. The water and sediment samples directly impacted the exploratory behavior of zebrafish, showing clear anxiety-like behavioral phenotype and stress in terms of cortisol increase (during the second rain event). The Cu exposure did not mimic the same behavioral changes triggered by the water and sediment samples, although it had caused similar stress in the fish. Our results highlight that even at low concentrations, the water and sediment samples from vineyard watershed runoff were able to induce behavioral and endocrine changes that may harm the ecological balance of an aquatic environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Screening of potential oestrogen receptor α agonists in pesticides via in silico, in vitro and in vivo methods
AB  - In modern agricultural management, the use of pesticides is indispensable. Due to their massive use worldwide, pesticides represent a latent risk to both humans and the environment. In the present study, 1056 frequently used pesticides were screened for oestrogen receptor (ER) agonistic activity by using in silico methods. We found that 72 and 47 pesticides potentially have ER agonistic activity by the machine learning methods random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN), respectively. Among endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), 14 have been reported as EDCs or ER agonists by previous studies. We selected 3 reported and 7 previously unreported pesticides from 76 potential ER agonists to further assess ERα agonistic activity. All 10 selected pesticides exhibited ERα agonistic activity in human cells or zebrafish. In the dual-luciferase reporter gene assays, six pesticides exhibited ERα agonistic activity. Additionally, nine pesticides could induce mRNA expression of the pS2 and NRF1 genes in MCF-7 cells, and seven pesticides could induce mRNA expression of the vtg1 and vtg2 genes in zebrafish. Importantly, the remaining 48 out of 76 potential ER agonists, none of which have previously been reported to have endocrine-disrupting effects or oestrogenic activity, should be of great concern. Our screening results can inform environmental protection goals and play an important role in environmental protection and early warnings to human health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of endosulfan: Modeling with zebrafish
AB  - Developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) comprises any adverse effects impeding normal development of the nervous system during its most vulnerable phase when the foundations are laid for a well-performing adult organism. DNT is among the least tested adverse health outcomes of chemicals and putative neurotoxic contaminants already present in the environment hamper human and environmental risk assessments. Irrespective of these data gaps, each year a large number of new chemicals released commercially also remain untested for their DNT potential. Novel high-throughput testing approaches and paradigms are therefore urgently needed to provide experimental data that addresses this general lack of knowledge. Here, we present how animal models can be used to address these issues and provide an overview of DNT potential of the now banned intsecticide endosulfan. Finally, we describe in detail how endosulfan affects early zebrafish (Danio rerio) development, by analysis of morphology, oxidative stress, and behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automated measurement of the spontaneous tail coiling of zebrafish embryos as a sensitive behavior endpoint using a workflow in KNIME
AB  - Neuroactive substances are the largest group of chemicals detected in European surface waters. Mixtures of neuroactive substances occurring at low concentrations can induce adverse neurological effects in humans and organisms in the environment. Therefore, there is a need to develop new screening tools to detect these chemicals. Measurement of behavior or motor effects in rodents and fish are usually performed to assess potential neurotoxicity for risk assessment. However, due to pain and stress inflicted on these animals, the scientific community is advocating for new alternative methods based on the 3R principle (reduce, replace and refine). As a result, the behavior measurement of early stages of zebrafish embryos such as locomotor response, photomotor response and spontaneous tail coiling are considered as a valid alternative to adult animal testing. In this study, we developed a workflow to investigate the spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of zebrafish embryos and to accurately measure the STC effect in the KNIME software. We validated the STC protocol with 3 substances (abamectin, chlorpyrifos-oxon and pyracostrobin) which have different mechanisms of action. The KNIME workflow combined with easy and cost-effective method of video acquisition makes this STC protocol a valuable method for neurotoxicity testing. • Video acquisition duration of 60 s at 25 ± 1 hpf was used • 20 embryos exposed per dish and acclimatized for 30 min before video acquisition • Capability to inspect and correct errors for high accuracy © 2021

TI  - Critical window of exposure of CMIT/MIT with respect to developmental effects on zebrafish embryos: Multi-level endpoint and proteomics analysis
AB  - Systemic toxicity, particularly, developmental defects of humidifier disinfectant chemicals that have caused lung injuries in Korean children, remains to be elucidated. This study evaluated the mechanisms of the adverse effects of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one/2methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (CMIT/MIT), one of the main biocides of the Korean tragedy, and identify the most susceptible developmental stage when exposed in early life. To this end, the study was designed to analyze several endpoints (morphology, heart rate, behavior, global DNA methylation, gene expressions of DNA methyl-transferases (dnmts) and protein profiling) in exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at various developmental stages. The results showed that CMIT/MIT exposure causes bent tail, pericardial edema, altered heart rates, global DNA hypermethylation and significant alterations in the locomotion behavior. Consistent with the morphological and physiological endpoints, proteomics profiling with bioinformatics analysis suggested that the suppression of cardiac muscle contractions and energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) were possible pivotal underlying mechanisms of the CMIT/MIT mediated adverse effects. Briefly, multi-level endpoint analysis indicated the most susceptible window of exposure to be ≤ 6 hpf followed by ≤ 48 hpf for CMIT/MIT. These results could potentially be translated to a risk assessment of the developmental exposure effects to the humidifier disinfectants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Moringa oleifera against Aedes aegypti: Insecticidal metabolites, modes-of-action and insights into the safety of use
AB  - The arboviroses dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya are considered major public health concerns worldwide. Since there are no vaccines against chikungunya and Zika, and vaccines against dengue still have a set of restrictions, the control of Aedes aegypti population represents the main strategy for reducing the spread of these diseases. The chemical control of A. aegypti has used pesticides of organochlorine, organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid classes. However, there are reports that A. aegypti has developed resistance to these compounds and thus more effective agents are urgently necessary. In this scenario, compounds expressed by the multipurpose plant Moringa oleifera have been investigated for effects on A. aegypti. This chapter provides a review on the insecticidal activity of M. oleifera metabolites and their modes-of action. Additionally, insights into the safety of their use are discussed. There are many reports of preparations from M. oleifera seeds or flowers, obtained with different solvents such as water, saline solution, and petroleum ether, able to kill A. aegypti larvae or eggs. The seed oil was also reported to be active against this insect. These effects were attributed to the action of secondary metabolites, lectins (carbohydratebinding proteins) or protease inhibitors, which can impair digestion and absorption of nutrients and damage the structure of larval midgut. Embryocidal activity, ability of arresting or delaying larval development, and interference with the oviposition behavior were described. The investigation of M. oleifera preparations for toxicity on non-target organisms, such as Danio rerio, or genotoxicity showed that their use on natural environments requires caution and must comply with concentration limits. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Comparison of the zebrafish embryo toxicity assay and the general and behavioral embryo toxicity assay as new approach methods for chemical screening
AB  - The movement away from mammalian testing of potential toxicants and new chemical entities has primarily led to cell line testing and protein-based assays. However, these assays may not yet be sufficient to properly characterize the toxic potential of a chemical. The zebrafish embryo model is widely recognized as a potential new approach method for chemical testing that may provide a bridge between cell and protein-based assays and mammalian testing. The Zebrafish Embryo Toxicity (ZET) model is increasingly recognized as a valuable toxicity testing platform. The ZET assay focuses on the early stages of embryo development and is considered a more humane model compared to adult zebrafish testing. A complementary model has been developed that exposes larvae to toxicants at a later time point during development where body patterning has already been established. Here we compare the toxicity profiles of 20 compounds for this General and Behavioral Toxicity (GBT) assay to the ZET assay. The results show partially overlapping toxicity profiles along with unique information provided by each assay. It appears from this work that these two assays applied together can strengthen the use of zebrafish embryos/larvae as standard toxicity testing models. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Tocotrienol rich fraction [TRF] is an extraction from palm oil. The purpose of this study is to analyses the effects of TRF toward rotenone induced zebrafish. Adult zebrafish [n=60] were separated into three groups. Group 1: Normal group [n=10], Group 2: Negative group [n=10], Group 3: Experimental group [n=40]. Zebrafish [n=50] were exposed to rotenone [5ug/L] for 28 days and later separate into four different groups with different concentrations of TRF [0.15, 0.3, 1.5, 3 mL]. Adult zebrafish underwent treatment for four weeks, analyses through behaviour study and toxicity study [Lc50]. Lc50 was observed in 2.7 mL of TRF. Adult zebrafish display slow swimming pattern after inducing with rotenone, but showed significant increased after the treatment suggest that TRF notably changed the behaviour of rotenone induced zebrafish. © 2020, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

TI  - Historical perspective: Models of Parkinson’s disease
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder with motor and nonmotor signs. The current therapeutic regimen for PD is mainly symptomatic as the etio-pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. A variety of animal models has been generated to study different aspects of the disease for understanding the pathogenesis and therapeutic development. The disease model can be generated through neurotoxin-based or genetic-based approaches in a wide range of animals such as non-human primates (NHP), rodents, zebrafish, Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans, and drosophila. Cellular-based disease model is frequently used because of the ease of manipulation and suitability for large-screen assays. In neurotoxin-induced models, chemicals such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat are used to recapitulate the disease. Genetic manipulation of PD-related genes, such as α-Synuclein(SNCA), Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), Pten-Induced Kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin(PRKN), and Protein deglycase (DJ-1) Are used in the transgenic models. An emerging model that combines both genetic-and neurotoxin-based methods has been generated to study the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different PD models and their utility for different research purposes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Monocrotophos Based Pesticide Alters the Behavior Response Associated with Oxidative Indices and Transcription of Genes Related to Apoptosis in Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Brain
AB  - Monocrotophos is one of the most widely used pesticides in India. The agricultural workers were exposed to high concentrations of these pesticides due to unsafe work practices, and also the individual exposed to these pesticides shows alterations in their neurobehavioral. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of Monocrotophos on the locomotor activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of genes related to apoptosis using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. The neurotoxic effects of sub-lethal concentration of the Monocrotophos on fish were evaluated. The locomotor activity of the fishes was determined, followed by an antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation assays were performed. The expression of genes related to apoptosis in the brain was also determined by qPCR. The Lethal Concentration for 96 hrs. was estimated to be 36.5 mg/L. When exposed to sub-lethal concentration, marked changes were observed in locomotor activity (distance traveled, swimming speed and meandering), acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant defenses in the brain. Expression of apoptotic genes determined by qPCR revealed an increase in Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expressions. Data from this study suggest that Monocrotophos based pesticides induce cellular toxicity, and has the potential to alter the behavior and health.

TI  - Modeling Parkinson’s disease in Zebrafish
AB  - Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that affects the motor system, and includes cardinal motor symptoms such as resting tremor, cogwheel rigidi-ty, bradykinesia and postural instability. Its prevalence is increasing worldwide due to the increase in life span. Although, two centuries since the first description of the disease, no proper cure with regard to treatment strategies and control of symptoms could be reached. One of the major challenges faced by the researchers is to have a suitable research model. Rodents are the most common PD models used, but no single model can replicate the true nature of PD. In this review, we aim to discuss another animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), which is gaining popularity. Zebrafish brain has all the major structures found in the mammalian brain, with neurotransmitter systems, and it also possesses a functional blood-brain barrier similar to humans. From the perspective of PD research, the zebrafish possesses the ventral diencephalon, which is thought to be homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra. We summarize the various zebrafish models available to study PD, namely chemical-induced and genetic models. The zebrafish can complement the use of other animal models for the mechanistic study of PD and help in the screening of new potential therapeutic compounds. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Cell-Based Optimization of Covalent Reversible Ketoamide Inhibitors Bridging the Unprimed to the Primed Site of the Proteasome β5 Subunit
AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is an established therapeutic target for approved drugs to treat selected hematologic malignancies. While drug discovery targeting the UPS focuses on irreversibly binding epoxyketones and slowly-reversibly binding boronates, optimization of novel covalent-reversibly binding warheads remains largely unattended. We previously reported α-ketoamides to be a promising reversible lead motif, yet the cytotoxic activity required further optimization. This work focuses on the lead optimization of phenoxy-substituted α-ketoamides combining the structure-activity relationships from the primed and the non-primed site of the proteasome β5 subunit. Our optimization strategy is accompanied by molecular modeling, suggesting occupation of P1′ by a 3-phenoxy group to increase β5 inhibition and cytotoxic activity in leukemia cell lines. Key compounds were further profiled for time-dependent inhibition of cellular substrate conversion. Furthermore, the α-ketoamide lead structure 27 does not affect escape response behavior in Danio rerio embryos, in contrast to bortezomib, which suggests increased target specificity. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Degradation products and pathway of ethiprole in water and soil
AB  - Ethiprole and its degradation products were identified and quantified using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Indoor culture experiments and UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS are used to study the hydrolysis, photolysis, and soil degradation behavior of ethiprole in water and soil. The differences in ethiprole degradation products across a range of environmental conditions such as pH, light, and oxygen availability were compared in order to improve understanding of the ethiprole degradation pathway and the toxicity of the degradation products. Eleven degradation products were identified using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS and MetaboLynx XS Training software, and two new degradation products (M401 and M312) were characterized by 1H NMR and HR MS. Three degradation products M401, M399, and M312 were detected in samples using a UHPLC-MS/MS protocol established in this study. Tests of acute toxicity of the three degradation products on Brachydanio rerio, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Daphnia magna Straus found that the toxicity of M401 to Daphnia magna Straus was greater than that of the parent compound, indicating that ethiprole degradation should be carefully monitored in given the environmental risk posed by its degradation products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Screening for drugs to reduce aggression in zebrafish
AB  - Aggression is a common symptom of several human psychiatric disorders. However, the drugs available to treat aggression are non-specific and can have unwanted side effects. The zebrafish is an ideal model for behavioural pharmacology. They are small, aggression can be measured reliably, and drugs can be applied by immersion in the tank water. The ability to visualise and manipulate circuits in the intact brain represents an excellent opportunity to understand how chemical compounds modify the signalling pathways that control this behaviour. This review discusses protocols to measure zebrafish aggression, the neural circuits that control this behaviour and how pharmacological studies can inform us about environmental toxicology and the development of therapeutic drugs for humans.

TI  - Development of the “hidden” multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD)is a chronic, fatal and complex neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by cholinergic system dysregulation, metal dyshomeostasis, amyloid-β (Aβ)aggregation, etc. Therefore in most cases, single-target or single-functional agents are insufficient to achieve the desirable effect against AD. Multi-Target-Directed Ligand (MTDL), which is rationally designed to simultaneously hit multiple targets to improve the pharmacological profiles, has been developed as a promising approach for drug discovery against AD. To identify the multifunctional agents for AD, we developed an innovative method to successfully conceal the metal chelator into acetylcholinesterase (AChE)inhibitor. Briefly, the “hidden” agents first cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)to inhibit the function of AChE, and the metal chelator will then be released via the enzymatic hydrolysis by AChE. Therefore, the AChE inhibitor, in this case, is not only a single-target agent against AD, but also a carrier of the metal chelator. In this study a total of 14 quinoline derivatives were synthesized and biologically evaluated. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that compound 9b could cross the BBB efficiently, then release 8a, the metabolite of 9b, into brain. In vitro, 9b had a potent AChE inhibitory activity, while 8a displayed a significant metal ion chelating function, therefore in combination, both 9b and 8a exhibited a considerable inhibition of Aβ aggregation, one of the observations that plays important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. The efficacy of 9b against AD was further investigated in both a zebrafish model and two different mice models. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Delamethrin can easy reach in the aquatic ecosystems and affects the life forms. It produces significant damage to the fish community. It is less know how the fish community reacts in the first hours when insecticide deltamethrin reaches their ecosystem and what biochemical mechanisms of protection are activated. The measurements of the behavior parameters from the tests can explain how fish community reacts before lethal and sublethal deltamethrin dosage. This can be similar to a shock wave produced during an ecological catastrophe where the fish community is involved. Which is the fate of the survivors? Can be their swimming performances recovered to assure their surviving? The aim of this study was to assess on zebrafish model the oxidative stress intensity (MDA, CAT, SOD, GPx) triggered by the acute exposure to lethal and sublethal relevant concentrations of delthametrin and swimming performances recovery of the survivors for: total distance swim, swim velocity, active swim, clockwise rotations, counterclockwise rotations and maximum acceleration. © 2019, Green Wave Publishing of Canada.

TI  - Toxicity profiling of flame retardants in zebrafish embryos using a battery of assays for developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity toward human relevance
AB  - Following the voluntary phase-out of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) due to their environmental persistence and toxicity, the organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) are emerging replacements. However, there is limited information on the potential human health effects of the OPFRs. Zebrafish embryos are a viable vertebrate model organism with many advantages for high throughput testing toward human hazard assessment. We utilized zebrafish embryos to assess developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, of eight replacement OPFRs: (triphenyl phosphate [TPHP], isopropylated phenyl phosphate [IPP], 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate [EHDP], tert-butylated phenyl diphenyl phosphate [BPDP], trimethyl phenyl phosphate [TMPP], isodecyl diphenyl phosphate [IDDP], tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate [TDCIPP], and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate [TCEP]) and two BFRs (3,3′,5,5′- tetrabromobisphenol A [TBBPA] and 2,2′4,4′-brominated diphenyl ether [BDE-47]). To determine potential effects on teratogenicity, embryos were exposed to flame retardants (FRs) at 4 h post fertilization (hpf) to 4 days post fertilization (dpf) and morphological alterations and corresponding survival were evaluated at 2 and 4 dpf. Internal concentrations were measured in larvae used in this assay by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Locomotor activity was assessed in larvae treated for 48 h (from 3 dpf to 5 dpf), followed by hepatotoxicity evaluation. Finally, alterations in heart rate and rhythmicity were assessed to determine cardiotoxicity in 48 hpf embryos exposed to compounds for 3 h. Results suggest that several OPFRs (BPDP, EHDP; IPP, TMPP; TPHP and TDCIPP) produced adverse effects in multiple target organs at concentrations comparable to the two BFRs. As these OPFRs have the capacity to disrupt an integrated vertebrate model, they potentially have the capacity to affect mammalian biology. Then, we compared the lowest effective levels (LEL) in zebrafish with estimated or measured human plasma concentrations using biomonitoring data (human plasma, breast milk, handwipe samples and house dust) and a high throughput toxicokinetic (HTTK) model. Results indicate that for some compounds, the nominal LELs were within the range of human exposures, while internal LELs in zebrafish are above internal exposures in humans. These findings demonstrate the value of the zebrafish model as a relevant screening tool and support the need for further hazard characterization of the OPFRs. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Developmental toxicity of deltamethrin and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid in embryo–larval stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Synthetic pyrethroids are the major insecticides used widely in agriculture and household pest control. Deltamethrin (DM), a widely used type II pyrethroid insecticide, is a relatively potent neurotoxicant. 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA) is the major metabolite formed due to metabolism of DM. In order to illustrate the toxic response of zebrafish embryos/larvae to DM and PBA the present research was carried out. For this 4hpf embryos were treated with two concentrations of DM (100 and 200 μg/L) for 48 h and PBA (1000 and 2000 μg/L) for 96 h or 99.9% ethanol (solvent control). Early life stage parameters were observed at specified time points. DM-treated embryo/larvae exhibited increased mortality, delay in hatching time, decrease in percentage of hatched embryos, increase of heartbeat rate and decrease in blood flow; lightening of body and eye pigmentation in a dose dependent manner. Pericardial and yolk sac edema along with were also caused by DM. Along with these crooked notochord, tail deformation was noticed in hatched and unhatched embryos. In case of PBA treated embryos and larvae, increased embryos/larvae length and yolk sac size were observed. Other abnormalities like edema (yolk sac and pericardial), decreased eye and body pigmentation were also observed but in some embryos only. These were not as severe as observed in parental compound indicating that DM is more toxic than its metabolite PBA. The data contributes to a better understanding of the potential consequences of fish exposed to DM and PBA. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Neurotoxin-Induced Animal Models of Parkinson Disease: Pathogenic Mechanism and Assessment
AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Pharmacological animal models are invaluable tools to study the pathological mechanisms of PD. Currently, invertebrate and vertebrate animal models have been developed by using several main neurotoxins, such as 6-hydroxydopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, paraquat, and rotenone. These models achieve to some extent to reproduce the key features of PD, including motor defects, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta, and the formation of Lewy bodies. In this review, we will highlight the pathogenic mechanisms of those neurotoxins and summarize different neurotoxic animal models with the hope to help researchers choose among them accurately and to promote the development of modeling PD. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Occurrence and risk assessment of persistent organic pollutants in a branch of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou, China
AB  - The Grand Canal is one of the most important waterways and sources of drinking water in China. The security of this water environment has a strong influence on national economic development and public health. However, data on the pollution status and potential risks due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in this area is insufficient. In this study, we selected a branch of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou as the study subject from which 16 surface water samples were collected in the summer of 2016. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (including 4 hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and 6 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)), 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 35 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the water samples were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Non-carcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and cytotoxicity experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential health risks due to these POPs. Additionally, the toxicological data for the Danio rerio aquatic organism from the US EPA were employed for comparison with the residue from POPs in this area. The results showed that the total concentrations of HCHs, DDTs, PCBs, and PAHs were 29.937, 60.2, 8.30, and 1670.2 ng/L, respectively. Some pollutants (including acenaphthene and acenaphthylene, hepta-PCBs and tetra-PCBs, octa-PCBs and hexa-PCBs, β-HCH and α-HCH, and δ-HCH and γ-HCH) showed a correlation, which indicated they might have a similar origin. There were no non-carcinogenic risks or ecological risks for adults, children, and aquatic organisms, but a relatively low carcinogenic risk for adults presented at certain sites. The data provided here will be helpful in fully understanding the pollution status of the surface water in this branch of the Grand Canal and the potential risks from this water. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Multidimensional chemobehavior analysis of flavonoids and neuroactive compounds in zebrafish
AB  - The comparative analysis of complex behavioral phenotypes is valuable as a reductionist tool for both drug discovery and defining chemical bioactivity. Flavonoids are a diverse class of chemicals that elicit robust neuroactive and hormonal actions, though bioactivity information is limited for many, particularly for neurobehavioral endpoints. Here, we used a zebrafish larval chemomotor response (LCR) bioassay to comparatively evaluate a suite of 24 flavonoids, and in addition a panel of 30 model neuroactive compounds representing diverse modes of action (e.g. caffeine, chlorpyrifos, methamphetamine, nicotine, picrotoxin). Naïve larval zebrafish were exposed to concentration ranges of each compound at 120 hour post-fertilization (hpf) and locomotor activity measured for 5 h. The model neuroactive compounds were largely behaviorally bioactive (20 of 30) with most effects phenotypic of their known modes of action. Flavonoids rapidly and broadly elicited hyperactive locomotor effects (22 of 24). Multidimensional analyses compared responses over time and identified three distinct bioactive groups of flavonoids based on efficacy and potency. Using GABAergics to modulate hyperactive responses, two flavonoids, (S)-equol and kaempferol were tested for GABAA receptor antagonism, as well as a known GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin. Pharmacological intervention with positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, alfaxalone and chlormethiazole, ameliorated the hyperactive response to picrotoxin, but not for (S)-equol or kaempferol. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that flavonoids are differentially bioactive and that the chemobehavioral effects likely do not involve a GABAA receptor mediated mode of action. Overall, the integrative zebrafish platform provides a useful framework for comparatively evaluating high-content chemobehavioral data for sets of structurally- and mechanistically-related flavonoids and neuroactive compounds. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Lipid metabolism alteration by endocrine disruptors in animal models: An overview
AB  - Exposure to potential Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) pose a documented risk to both wildlife and human health. Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the “environmental obesogens” hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause “transgenerational effects” by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

TI  - Zebrafish models of autism spectrum disorder
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor, social and cognitive deficits that develop early during childhood. The pathogenesis of ASD is not well characterized and involves a multifaceted interaction between genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors. Animal (experimental) models possess evolutionarily conserved behaviors and molecular pathways that are highly relevant for studying ASD. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a relatively new animal model with promise for understanding the pathogenesis of complex brain disorders and discovering novel treatments. As a highly social and genetically tractable organism, zebrafish have recently been applied to model a variety of deficits relevant to ASD. Here, we discuss the developing utility of zebrafish models of ASD, as well as current behavioral, toxicological and genetic models of ASD, and future directions of research in this field. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Tributyltin induces premature hatching and reduces locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos/larvae at environmentally relevant levels
AB  - Tributyltin (TBT) is an organotin compound that is the active ingredient of many biocides and antifouling agents. In addition to its well established role as an endocrine disruptor, TBT is also associated with adverse effects on the nervous system and behavior. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of TBT (0.01, 0.1, 1 nM) to determine how low levels affected development and behavior. Fish exposed to 1 nM TBT hatched earlier when compared to controls. Following a 96-h exposure, total swimming distance, velocity, and activity of zebrafish larvae were reduced compared to controls. To identify putative mechanisms for these altered endpoints, we assessed embryo bioenergetics and gene expression. We reasoned that the accelerated hatch time could be related to ATP production and energy, thus embryos were exposed to TBT for 24 and 48-h exposure prior to hatch. There were no differences among groups for endpoints related to bioenergetics (i.e. basal, ATP-dependent, and maximal respiration). To address mechanisms related to changes in behavioral activity, we measured transcripts associated with muscle function (myf6, myoD, and myoG) and dopamine signaling (th, dat, dopamine receptors) as dopamine regulates behavior. No transcript was altered in expression by TBT in larvae, suggesting that other mechanisms exist that may explain changes in higher level endpoints. These results suggest that endpoints related to the whole animal (i.e. timing of hatch and locomotor behavior) are more sensitive to environmentally-relevant concentrations of TBT compared to the molecular and metabolic endpoints examined here. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Neurotoxicity of a biopesticide analog on Zebrafish larvae at nanomolar concentrations
AB  - Despite the ever-increasing role of pesticides in modern agriculture, their deleterious effects are still underexplored. Here we examine the effect of A6, a pesticide derived from the naturally-occurring α-terthienyl, and structurally related to the endocrine disrupting pesticides anilinopyrimidines, on living zebrafish larvae. We show that both A6 and an anilinopyrimidine, cyprodinyl, decrease larval survival and affect central neurons at micromolar concentrations. Focusing on a superficial and easily observable sensory system, the lateral line system, we found that defects in axonal and sensory cell regeneration can be observed at much lower doses, in the nanomolar range. We also show that A6 accumulates preferentially in lateral line neurons and hair cells. We examined whether A6 affects the expression of putative target genes, and found that genes involved in apoptosis/cell proliferation are down-regulated, as well as genes reflecting estrogen receptor activation, consistent with previous reports that anilinopyrimidines act as endocrine disruptors. On the other hand, canonical targets of endocrine signaling are not affected, suggesting that the neurotoxic effect of A6 may be due to the binding of this compound to a recently identified, neuron-specific estrogen receptor. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Bioavailability and bioconcentration potential of perfluoroalkyl-phosphinic and -phosphonic acids in zebrafish (Danio rerio): Comparison to perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates
AB  - Currently, information regarding bioavailability and bioconcentration potential of perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiAs) in aquatic organisms does not exist. The main objective of the present study was to assess uptake and elimination kinetics of PFPiAs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) following aqueous exposure. The results showed that PFPiA exposure can result in very high steady-state bioconentration factors (BCFss), compared to perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates.C6/C10 PFPiA exhibited the highest BCFss, ranging between 107 and 1010, orders of magnitude higher than those for long-chain perfluorocarboxylates. Strong positive relationships were observed between BCFss versus the membrane-water distribution coefficient (Dmw) and the protein-water partition coefficient (Kpw) of the studied perfluoroalkyl substances. However, BCFss exhibited a substantial drop for the very hydrophobic PFPiAs (C8/C10 and C6/C12 PFPiAs). The reduced BCFss of these long-chain PFPiAs (perfluoroalkyl chain length = 18; Dmw = 109) is likely the result of reduced bioavailability due to interaction with solute molecules/organic matter present in the water phase and/or reduced gill membrane permeability. While PFPiAs can be metabolized to perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acids, the metabolic transformation rate seems insufficient to counteract the high degree of uptake across gill membranes. These findings help to better understand exposure pathways and bioaccumulation behavior of these important perfluorinated acids in aquatic systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - High-throughput characterization of chemical-associated embryonic behavioral changes predicts teratogenic outcomes
AB  - New strategies are needed to address the data gap between the bioactivity of chemicals in the environment versus existing hazard information. We address whether a high-throughput screening (HTS) system using a vertebrate organism (embryonic zebrafish) can characterize chemical-elicited behavioral responses at an early, 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) stage that predict teratogenic consequences at a later developmental stage. The system was used to generate full concentration–response behavioral profiles at 24 hpf across 1060 ToxCast™ chemicals. Detailed, morphological evaluation of all individuals was performed as experimental follow-up at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Chemicals eliciting behavioral responses were also mapped against external HTS in vitro results to identify specific molecular targets and neurosignalling pathways. We found that, as an integrative measure of normal development, significant alterations in movement highlighted active chemicals representing several modes of action. These early behavioral responses were predictive for 17 specific developmental abnormalities and mortality measured at 5 dpf, often at lower (i.e., more potent) concentrations than those at which morphological effects were observed. Therefore, this system can provide rapid characterization of chemical-elicited behavioral responses at an early developmental stage that are predictive of observable adverse effects later in life. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of ellagic acid and curcumin against the toxicity induced by rotenone (ROT) in zebrafish and Drosophila melanogaster. Materials and Methods: Adult zebrafish were concomitantly exposed to ROT 5 μl/L and ellagic acid (20, 40 mg/kg) and curcumin (20, 40 mg/kg) intramuscularly for 14 days whereas adult wild-Type flies were concomitantly exposed to ROT (500 μM), respectively and ellagic acid (0.05% and 0.1%) and curcumin (0.05% and 0.1%) in the food during 7 days. Results: ROT produced marked decreased in the zebrafish swimming behavior and flies had a poorer performance (21-31%) in the negative geotaxis assay (i.e., climbing capability) when compared to control group. Ellagic acid and curcumin treatment offered protection (54-80%) against the ROT-induced locomotor impairment and performed better in zebrafish and in the negative geotaxis assay suggesting attenuation of ROT-induced locomotor deficits. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that ellagic acid and curcumin was effective in reducing the toxicity induced by ROT in zebrafish and D. melanogaster as well as confirm the significance of this model to explore possible therapeutic approaches on movement disorders, including Parkinson disease.

TI  - Zebrafish: A Versatile Animal Model for Fertility Research
AB  - The utilization of zebrafish in biomedical research is very common in the research world nowadays. Today, it has emerged as a favored vertebrate organism for the research in science of reproduction. There is a significant growth in amount numbers of scientific literature pertaining to research discoveries in reproductive sciences in zebrafish. It has implied the importance of zebrafish in this particular field of research. In essence, the current available literature has covered from the very specific brain region or neurons of zebrafish, which are responsible for reproductive regulation, until the gonadal level of the animal. The discoveries and findings have proven that this small animal is sharing a very close/similar reproductive system with mammals. More interestingly, the behavioral characteristics and along with the establishment of animal courtship behavior categorization in zebrafish have laid an even stronger foundation and firmer reason on the suitability of zebrafish utilization in research of reproductive sciences. In view of the immense importance of this small animal for the development of reproductive sciences, this review aimed at compiling and describing the proximate close similarity of reproductive regulation on zebrafish and human along with factors contributing to the infertility, showing its versatility and its potential usage for fertility research. © 2016 Jing Ying Hoo et al.

TI  - Zebrafish Parkinson’s model: Rotenone decrease motility, dopamine, and increase α-synuclein aggregation and apoptosis of zebrafish brain
AB  - Rotenone is a pesticide that is widely used to kill insects and nuisance fish in lakes. The mechanism of toxicity of rotenone is primarily mediated by its potent mitochondrial complex I inhibition. In this study, we examined the motility, dopamine, - synuclein and apoptosis as hallmark of PD in rotenone-induced zebrafish (Danio rerio). We used adult zebrafish (8 months) and exposed to 5 g/L rotenone for 28 days. Motility observed for 5 minutes in each week. Measurement dopamine (DA) by ELISA, apoptosis by immunohistochemistry and -synuclein by immunohistochemistry and westernblotting of zebrafish brain. The results showed that rotenone significantly (p < 0.05) decreased motility start at day 14, decreased dopamine, increasing α-synuclein expression and aggregation that seems both of that leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells. Together, these data suggest that sub chronic exposure (28 days) of rotenone 5 μg/L caused Parkinsonism due to decreases dopamine level, locomotor activity, increasing α-synuclein expression and aggregation and apoptosis of dopaminergic neuron as well. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

TI  - Proteinaceous compounds from fragaria ananassa fruit attenuates paraquat induced Parkinson like locomotor and mitochondrial alterations in Zebrafish
AB  - Objectives: To assess the Parkinson like locomotor and mitochondrial alterations, associated with the exposure of paraquat (PQ), in vivo preventive effect of proteinaceous compounds extracted from Fragaria ananassa fruit (FA-D) against mitochondrial dysfunction induced by paraquat in zebra fish using brain mitochondria. Methods: Parkinson like locomotor and mitochondrial alterations were resulted by intra peritoneal administration of 55 mM PQ alternatively for a period of 7 days. The water soluble proteinaceous compounds from Fragaria ananassa fruit were obtained by Ammonium sulphate fractionation. The molecular weight of FA-D fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE and we found three distinct bands at 20.0 kDa, 17.0 kDa and 14.4.0 kDa respectively. The in vitro antioxidant activity and the in vivo preventive effect of FA-D against PQ induced Parkinsonian symptoms were evaluated by different assay systems viz., in vitro: radical scavenging activity by DPPH reaction and in vivo: locomotion, dopamine levels, and complex-I activity, mitochondrial ROS levels, cytochrome c release and mitochondrial morphology. Results: The results show that paraquat altered locomotor activity and increased dopamine levels. Mitochondria isolated from paraquat treated zebrafish showed a marked inhibition of complex-I activity, increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mt ROS) and cytochrome c release and disintegration of mitochondrial structure. Treatment of 0.25 mg/kg body weight of FA-D fraction once in alternative days, for 5 days subsequent to the administration of PQ alternatively for a period of 7days, substantially reduced mt ROS levels and markedly restored the complex-I activity, cytochrome c release and mitochondrial morphology. Conclusion: The results strongly suggest that proteinaceous compounds from Fragaria ananassa fruit recuperate paraquat induced Parkinsonian like symptoms by protecting the mitochondria. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

TI  - Zebrafish: Topics in reproduction, toxicology and development
AB  - This informative new volume on the reproduction and development of zebrafish provides a timely and fundamental set of chapters presenting new data and critical reviews to the novice student and veteran researcher alike. It covers two major areas of zebrafish biology, reproduction and development, with toxicology emphasized in a number of chapters. Historically, reproductive biology of zebrafish has not been given the attention afforded to the more intensively studied aspects of embryonic development in this model species. In part, this may be due to fewer tools available to zebrafish reproductive biologists. However, with the advent of transparent juvenile and adult lines, new areas of reproduction research become visible both figuratively and literally. Two chapters are devoted to presenting these exciting new fish lines and examples of their use in research to the reproductive biology research community. Reproduction and embryonic development are a continuum which is emphasized in a new review on RNA-binding proteins in the zebrafish oocyte. It is increasingly clear that embryonic development is dependent upon factors present in the female gamete known collectively as "maternal effects", and these oocyte components are beautifully summarized in this chapter. Other chapters cover normal spawning periodicity and vitellogenic oocyte growth dynamics that should interest ovarian physiologists and those interested in zebrafish husbandry. Further sections of this book describe experiments centered on zebrafish development. One section focuses on experiments involving the protein localization of the Sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (Slc12a2) during zebrafish embryogenesis and has an emphasis on myogenesis. Another section introduces the zebrafish dead elvis (del) mutant. This section highlights experiments involving whole-mount immunohistochemistry experiments describing the muscle defects as well as the positional cloning and complementation analysis indicating that dead elvis carries a mutation of the Titina gene. The advantage of using the zebrafish as a basic model for kidney development research is comprehensively reviewed. This section considers technology available for use in zebrafish including; morpholinos, CRISPR-Cas, and TALENs. These are discussed with regard to better understanding nephrogenesis in zebrafish. Another overarching topic presented in several chapters of this book highlights the zebrafish as a model vertebrate for toxicological screening and understanding exposure rates during reproduction, development and throughout life. Basic procedures for toxicant testing are discussed in relationship to organogenesis and are extended beyond establishing a simple lethal concentration dose for the organism. Another chapter appraised three different assays and their usage to screen for toxicant-induced behavioral defects using zebrafish. Specific sections within this book emphasize research and the current understanding of lead neurotoxicity. Also, a standard test procedure is introduced using zebrafish to better understand gene expression changes in response to pesticide exposures. Overall, these chapters discuss procedures, assays, and different mechanisms that environmental toxicants use to influence development and behavior. Collectively, this book provides an overview of reproductive pathways, basic development, and toxicological screening focused on using zebrafish as a premier model organism for these processes. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Vision-based real-time monitoring on the behavior of zebrafish school
AB  - To study the behavioral responses of zebrafish under the combination effect of cypermethrin and deltamethrin, a set of motion activities were monitored and analyzed using a computer-imaging technique. Endpoints included swimming activity, social interaction within fish school and fish distribution. Results showed that the swimming speed of zebrafish increased significantly when exposed to the two toxicants. The swimming speed increased from 30 60 mm·s-1 to 60 85 mm·s-1 within the first thirty minutes exposure, and then immediately decreased to 20 mm·s-1. The swimming depth decreased after 12 minutes exposure. Under chronic exposure, the communication patterns between fish were changed, and the swimming distance and dispersion increased by 43.5% and 120.0%, respectively. Zebrafish preferred swimming and staying on the water surface with lower toxic concentration. The vision-based real-time zebrafish swimming pattern monitoring method combined the calculation of swimming speed, depth, distance between fish, dispersion and time spend in different areas, therefore is a more comprehensive and effective system than the traditional individual fish and single endpoint monitoring method to give the early warning signal of water contamination.

TI  - Zebrafish model systems for developmental neurobehavioral toxicology
AB  - Zebrafish offer many advantages that complement classic mammalian models for the study of normal development as well as for the teratogenic effects of exposure to hazardous compounds. The clear chorion and embryo of the zebrafish allow for continuous visualization of the anatomical changes associated with development, which, along with short maturation times and the capability of complex behavior, makes this model particularly useful for measuring changes to the developing nervous system. Moreover, the rich array of developmental, behavioral, and molecular benefits offered by the zebrafish have contributed to an increasing demand for the use of zebrafish in behavioral teratology. Essential for this endeavor has been the development of a battery of tests to evaluate a spectrum of behavior in zebrafish. Measures of sensorimotor plasticity, emotional function, cognition and social interaction have been used to characterize the persisting adverse effects of developmental exposure to a variety of chemicals including therapeutic drugs, drugs of abuse and environmental toxicants. In this review, we present and discuss such tests and data from a range of developmental neurobehavioral toxicology studies using zebrafish as a model. Zebrafish provide a key intermediate model between high throughput in vitro screens and the classic mammalian models as they have the accessibility of in vitro models and the complex functional capabilities of mammalian models. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish neurotransmitter systems as potential pharmacological and toxicological targets
AB  - Recent advances in neurobiology have emphasized the study of brain structure and function and its association with numerous pathological and toxicological events. Neurotransmitters are substances that relay, amplify, and modulate electrical signals between neurons and other cells. Neurotransmitter signaling mediates rapid intercellular communication by interacting with cell surface receptors, activating second messenger systems and regulating the activity of ion channels. Changes in the functional balance of neurotransmitters have been implicated in the failure of central nervous system function. In addition, abnormalities in neurotransmitter production or functioning can be induced by several toxicological compounds, many of which are found in the environment. The zebrafish has been increasingly used as an animal model for biomedical research, primarily due to its genetic tractability and ease of maintenance. These features make this species a versatile tool for pre-clinical drug discovery and toxicological investigations. Here, we present a review regarding the role of different excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish, such as dopaminergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic, purinergic, histaminergic, nitrergic, glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic systems, and emphasizing their features as pharmacological and toxicological targets. The increase in the global knowledge of neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish and the elucidation of their pharmacological and toxicological aspects may lead to new strategies and appropriate research priorities to offer insights for biomedical and environmental research. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Persistent behavioral impairment caused by embryonic methylphenidate exposure in zebrafish
AB  - As more adults take the stimulant medication methylphenidate to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) residual type, the risk arises with regard to exposure during early development if people taking the medication become pregnant. We studied the neurobehavioral effects of methylphenidate in zebrafish. Zebrafish offer cellular reporter systems, continuous visual access and molecular interventions such as morpholinos to help determine critical mechanisms underlying neurobehavioral teratogenicity. Previously, we had seen that persisting neurobehavioral impairment in zebrafish with developmental chlorpyrifos exposure was associated with disturbed dopamine systems. Because methylphenidate is an indirect dopamine agonist, it was thought that it might also cause persistent behavioral impairment after developmental exposure. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the ADHD stimulant medication methylphenidate 0-5. days post fertilization (12.5-50. mg/l). They were tested for long-term behavioral effects as adults. Methylphenidate exposure (50. mg/l) caused significant increases in dopamine, norepinepherine and serotonin on day 6 but not day 30 after fertilization. In the novel tank diving test of predatory avoidance developmental methylphenidate (50. mg/l) caused a significant reduction in the normal diving response. In the three-chamber spatial learning task early developmental methylphenidate (50. mg/l) caused a significant impairment in choice accuracy. These data show that early developmental exposure of zebrafish to methylphenidate causes a long-term impairment in neurobehavioral plasticity. The identification of these functional deficits in zebrafish enables further studies with this model to determine how molecular and cellular mechanisms are disturbed to arrive at this compromised state. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Differential expression profile of membrane proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain exposed to methyl parathion
AB  - Methyl parathion (MP) is a widely used organophosphorus pesticide, which has been related to a broad spectrum of toxic effects on environmental organisms. The present study investigated the changes in the protein profile of enriched membrane fraction from zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain exposed to three concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2mg/L) of MP. 2-DE revealed that the abundance of 21 protein spots was significantly changed by MP stress. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and database search, 16 protein spots were identified as membrane proteins, among which 8 were down-regulated, while 8 were up-regulated. These proteins are mainly involved in oxidative stress response, signal transduction, metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation, neuroplasticity and regeneration as well as synaptic transmission. These results may aid our understanding of the mechanism of MP-induced neurotoxicity and provide the possibility of the establishment of candidate biomarkers of MP. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Developmental toxicity screening in zebrafish
AB  - Given the ever-increasing toxic exposure ubiquitously present in our environment as well as emerging evidence that these exposures are hazardous to human health, the current rodent-based regulations are proving inadequate. In the process of overhauling risk assessment methodology, a nonrodent test organism, the zebrafish, is emerging as tractable for medium- and high-throughput assessments, which may help to accelerate the restructuring of standards. Zebrafish have high developmental similarity to mammals in most aspects of embryo development, including early embryonic processes, and on cardiovascular, somite, muscular, skeletal, and neuronal systems. Here, we briefly describe the development of these systems and then chronicle the toxic impacts assessed following chemical exposure. We also compare the available data in zebrafish toxicity assays with two databases containing mammalian toxicity data. Finally, we identify gaps in our collective knowledge that are ripe for future studies. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish biogenic amine transporters and behavior in novel environments: Targets of reuptake inhibitors and pesticide action as tools for neurotoxicology research
AB  - Central monoamine systems (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) are associated with motivation, locomotion, social behavior, emotion, and mood. Biogenic amine transporters regulate neurotransmission by removing neurotransmitters from synapses and extracellular fluid. Despite evolutionary divergence, teleost fish and mammalian transporter proteins appear similar, particularly at active binding sites. However, it is not clear if the similarities extend to functional responses, reuptake-inhibiting drugs, or involvement in delayed neurotoxic responses to pesticide exposures. Under certain exposure conditions, alterations in expression and function of these transporters may be more sensitive biomarkers of pesticide exposure or neurodegenerative disease risk than acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavioral assays targeting associative responses such as anxiety are useful as pharmacological and toxicological screens, or for studying modulation of behavior by central neurotransmitter systems. In novel environments, zebrafish go to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, a stereotypical behavior (attributed to predator anxiety) forming the basis of the novel light/dark aquatic plus maze characterized in this chapter. Such behavioral paradigms are an essential component to establish zebrafish as pharmacological and toxicological research models. Herein adult zebrafish are exposed to reuptake inhibitors and representative organochloride, organophosphate, or pyrethroid pesticides at 1 μg day-1 for 21 days, tested for anxious response in the light/dark plus maze, then assayed for dopamine and serotonin transporter density by radioligand binding. Exposures to these compounds variably affect dopamine and serotonin transporter density and alter behavior in the maze as compared to controls. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Gene-environment interactions: Neurodegeneration in non-mammals and mammals
AB  - The understanding of how environmental exposures interact with genetics in central nervous system dysfunction has gained great momentum in the last decade. Seminal findings have been uncovered in both mammalian and non-mammalian model in large result of the extraordinary conservation of both genetic elements and differentiation processes between mammals and non-mammalians. Emerging model organisms, such as the nematode and zebrafish have made it possible to assess the effects of small molecules rapidly, inexpensively, and on a miniaturized scale. By combining the scale and throughput of in vitro screens with the physiological complexity and traditional animal studies, these models are providing relevant information on molecular events in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. The utility of these models is largely driven by the functional conservation seen between them and higher organisms, including humans so that knowledge obtained using non-mammalian model systems can often provide a better understanding of equivalent processes, pathways, and mechanisms in man. Understanding the molecular events that trigger neurodegeneration has also greatly relied upon the use of tissue culture models. The purpose of this summary is to provide-state-of-the-art review of recent developments of non-mammalian experimental models and their utility in addressing issues pertinent to neurotoxicity (Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio). The synopses by Aschner and Levin summarize how genetic mutants of these species can be used to complement the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with neurobehavioral toxicity and neurodegeneration. Next, studies by Suñol and Olopade detail the predictive value of cultures in assessing neurotoxicity. Suñol and colleagues summarize present novel information strategies based on in vitro toxicity assays that are predictive of cellular effects that can be extrapolated to effects on individuals. Olopade and colleagues describe cellular changes caused by sodium metavanadate (SMV) and demonstrate how rat primary astrocyte cultures can be used as predicitive tools to assess the neuroprotective effects of antidotes on vanadium-induced astrogliosis and demyelination. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Overview of developmental and reproductive toxicity research in China: History, funding mechanisms, and frontiers of the research
AB  - Reproductive and developmental toxicology (DART) is the discipline that deals with adverse effects on male and female resulting from exposures to harmful chemical and physical agents. DART research in China boasted a long history, but presently has fallen behind the western world in education and research. The funding mechanisms for DART research in China were similar to that for other toxicological disciplines, and the funding has come from research grants and fellowships provided by national, ministerial, and provincial institutions. Finally, the frontiers of DART research in China could be summarized as follows: (1) use of model animals such as the zebrafish and roundworm, and use of cutting-edge techniques such as stem cell culture, as well as transgenic, metabonomic, and virtual screening to study the mechanisms of developmental toxicity for some important toxicants in China; (2) use of model animals and other lower-level sentinel organisms to evaluate and monitor the developmental toxicogical risk of environmental chemicals or pollutants; (3) epidemiological studies of some important reproductive hazards; (4) in-depth studying of the reproductive and developmental toxicity of some important environmental chemicals; and (5) evaluation and study of the reproductive and developmental toxicity of traditional Chinese medicines. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish behavioral profiling links drugs to biological targets and rest/wake regulation
AB  - A major obstacle for the discovery of psychoactive drugs is the inability to predict how small molecules will alter complex behaviors. We report the development and application of a high-throughput, quantitative screen for drugs that alter the behavior of larval zebrafish. We found that the multidimensional nature of observed phenotypes enabled the hierarchical clustering of molecules according to shared behaviors. Behavioral profiling revealed conserved functions of psychotropic molecules and predicted the mechanisms of action of poorly characterized compounds. In addition, behavioral profiling implicated new factors such as ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) potassium channels and immunomodulators in the control of rest and locomotor activity. These results demonstrate the power of high-throughput behavioral profiling in zebrafish to discover and characterize psychotropic drugs and to dissect the pharmacology of complex behaviors.

TI  - Online biomonitoring for waterborne antibiotics and organophosphorous using the Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor
AB  - The movement behavior of Danio rerio was studied as a bioindicator of contamination by antibiotics (Enrofloxacin, Sulfadiazine) and organophosphorous pesticides (Dimethoate, Malathion) using an online biomonitoring method, the Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB). A static test of acute toxicity revealed the 96 h LC50 values (95% confidence limit) for Danio rerio to be 61 mg · L-1 for Dimethoate and 5.4 mg · L-1 for Malathion. No acute toxicity for Enrofloxacin and Sulfadiazine to Danio rerio was observed during the 96 h exposure period. The behavioral response of Danio rerio was sensitive to exposure to antibiotics and organophosphorous pesticides. Increasing concentration resulted in more intensive behavioral responses of Danio rerio with more short response time, which could be described by the Stepwise Stress Model (SSM). The behavior change of Danio rerio exhibited a positive relation to the acute toxicity test. Therefore, movement behavior can be effectively applied as a bioindicator and early warning of antibiotic and organophosphorous pesticide contamination by online biomonitoring.

TI  - Genetic aspects of behavioral neurotoxicology
AB  - Considerable progress has been made over the past couple of decades concerning the molecular bases of neurobehavioral function and dysfunction. The field of neurobehavioral genetics is becoming mature. Genetic factors contributing to neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have been found and evidence for genetic factors contributing to other diseases such as schizophrenia and autism are likely. This genetic approach can also benefit the field of behavioral neurotoxicology. It is clear that there is substantial heterogeneity of response with behavioral impairments resulting from neurotoxicants. Many factors contribute to differential sensitivity, but it is likely that genetic variability plays a prominent role. Important discoveries concerning genetics and behavioral neurotoxicity are being made on a broad front from work with invertebrate and piscine mutant models to classic mouse knockout models and human epidemiologic studies of polymorphisms. Discovering genetic factors of susceptibility to neurobehavioral toxicity not only helps identify those at special risk, it also advances our understanding of the mechanisms by which toxicants impair neurobehavioral function in the larger population. This symposium organized by Edward Levin and Annette Kirshner, brought together researchers from the laboratories of Michael Aschner, Douglas Ruden, Ulrike Heberlein, Edward Levin and Kathleen Welsh-Bohmer conducting studies with Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, fish, rodents and humans studies to determine the role of genetic factors in susceptibility to behavioral impairment from neurotoxic exposure. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effects of triclosan on zebrafish early-life stages and adults
AB  - Background, aim and scope The biocide triclosan (TCS) is commonly used in personal care, acrylic, plastic, and textiles products. TCS has been detected in surface water in several countries, and its ecological impact is largely unknown. In this work, the toxicity of TCS in zebrafish (Danio rerio), embryos and adults was studied. Several lethal and sub-lethal endpoints were analysed in organisms exposed to TCS such as mortality, embryo development and behaviour, hatching, micronuclei and biochemical markers (cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)). Materials and methods Embryo/larvae assay followed the OECD guideline on Fish Embryo Toxicity Test. Embryos were exposed at nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mg/l of TCS for 6 days and were inspected daily with the help of a stereomicroscopy for mortality, developmental parameters (otolith formation, eye and body pigmentation, somite formation, heart beat, tail circulation, detachment of the tail-bud from the yolk sac) and hatching. A similar test was run to obtain larvae for ChE, GST and LDH analysis. The adult test followed the OECD Guideline TG 203 in semi-static conditions. Adult zebrafish of similar length and age were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mg/l of TCS for 96 h and were inspected daily for mortality and behaviour alterations. A second test was run to obtain organs for biomarkers analysis: Heads, muscles and gills were isolated and snap-frozen in eppendorfs and used for ChE, LDH and GST determinations, respectively. Adult zebrafish testing also comprised a third test for micronucleus analysis in which the nominal concentrations of 0, 0.175 and 0.350 mg/l were used. Peripheral blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and used for the analysis. Results TCS showed acute toxicity for embryo/larvae (96 h LC50 = 0.42 mg/l) and delayed hatching. Moreover, embryo toxicity was evident: Delay on the otolith formation and eye and body pigmentation were found, and malformations were also evident, including spine malformations, pericardial oedema and undersize. Biomarkers levels were affected: ChE and LDH activity were increased in larvae exposed to 0.25 mg/l, and GST activity was increased in larvae exposed to 0.25 and 0.35 mg/l. TCS also demonstrated acute toxicity to adult zebrafish (96 h LC50 = 0.34 mg/l). However, TCS did not change biomarkers levels and did not elicit a micronucleus in adults. Discussions Despite the fact that similar 96 h LC50 values have been found for D. rerio embryos and adults (0.42 and 0.34 mg/l, respectively), the embryo assay was much more informative, showing important effects at several levels, including teratogenic response, hatching delay and alteration of biomarker levels. TCS does not seem to be genotoxic for adult fish or to interfere with biomarkers levels at the concentrations tested. Conclusions TCS has deleterious effects on zebrafish adults and during early stages, (including embryotoxicity, hatching delay and alterations of biomarkers levels). The range of endpoints used on the embryo test allows an integrated analysis that contributes to a better understanding of the toxicity and mode of action of TCS. Recommendations and perspectives Future works should focus on a deeper investigation of TCS modes of action on zebrafish early-life stages. As embryo testing was revealed to be so informative, a refinement of the test could be made, including other endpoints such as different biochemical markers as well as DNA microarrays to assess a gene expression level for the effect of exposure to TCS. In the perspective of risk assessment, these endpoints should be explored in order to assess their usefulness as early warning signs and links should be sought between these short-term tests and effects of long-term exposures as it is observed in more realistic scenarios. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - The zebrafish model organism is increasingly used for assessing drug toxicity and safety and numerous studies confirm that mammalian and zebrafish toxicity profiles are strikingly similar. This transparent vertebrate offers several compelling experimental advantages, including convenient drug delivery and low cost. Although full validation will require assessment of a large number of compounds from diverse classes, zebrafish can be used to eliminate potentially unsafe compounds rapidly in the early stages of drug development and to prioritize compounds for further preclinical and clinical studies. Adaptation of conventional instrumentation combined with new nanotechnology developments will continue to expand use of zebrafish for drug screening. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Humic substances - Part 2: Interactions with organisms
AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms. Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies. Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure. Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes. Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded. At present the ecological consequences of these findings remain obscure. However, a multiple-stress resistance may be acquired which improves the individual fitness in a fluctuating environment. Conclusions. It appears that dissolved HS have to be considered abiotic ecological driving forces, somewhat less obvious than temperature, nutrients, or light. Perspectives. The understanding of the ecological control by dissolved humic substances is still fragmentary and needs to be studied in more details. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Neue Wege in die Ökotoxikologie: Quantitative Verhaltensmessungen an Fischen als Toxizitätsendpunkt
AB  - Es wird das Verhaltensmeßgerät BehavioQuant vorgestellt. Dieses automatisierte System erlaubt quantitative Verhaltensmessungen an Fischen und anderen Testorganismen. Die sich frei im Testraum bewegenden Tiere werden per Videokamera beobachtet und ihre Bewegungsbahnen in einem Koordinatenraster numerisch festgehalten. Aus diesen werden verschiedene Verhaltensparameter wie mittlere Schwimmhöhe, mittlere Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit, Ungleichförmigkeit der Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit, Richtungsänderungen. Häufigkeitsverteilung der Aufenthaltsorte in Vertikal‐ und Horizontalrichtung (z. B. zur Erfassung einer Hell‐Dunkel‐Präferenz) und das Abstandsverhalten der Tiere untereinander automatisch errechnet. Das Gerät erlaubt eine fortlaufende Überwachung von bis zu 16 Aquarien. Die statistischen Vergleichsberechnungen zwischen verschiedenen Behandlungs‐und Kontrollgruppen erfolgen für die einzelnen Verhaltensmeßgrößen gesondert. Bei der kontinuierlichen Überwachung von Oberflächengewässern erfolgt eine automatische Bewertung aus Vergleichen zwischen den aktuellen Meßwerten und denen eines sich fließend anpassenden Referenz‐Zeitraumes. Die Anwendung des BehavioQuant wird an einigen Beispielen (Wirkung von Atrazin) demonstriert. Verhaltensänderungen einer einzelnen Spezies können, bedingt durch die Wechselwirkungen zu ihrem Lebensraum und anderen darin lebenden Arten, Veränderungen der biozönotischen Strukturen und Funktionen hervorrufen. Änderungen auf einer bestimmten Ebene beeinflussen häufig auch andere Ebenen eines Ökosystems und können zu Verschiebungen von Gleichgewichten führen. Daher ist bei einer ökotoxikologischen Bewertung die Einbeziehung quantifizierter Verhaltensbeobachtungen geboten. Copyright © 1995 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI  - Anxiety-related behavior and associated brain transcriptome and epigenome alterations in adult female zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis
AB  - Atrazine often contaminates drinking water sources, exceeding the maximum contaminant level established by the US Environmental Protection Agency at 3 parts per billion (ppb; μg/L). Atrazine is linked to endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity, and cancer, with delayed health effects observed after developmental exposure in line with the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that embryonic atrazine exposure induces delayed neurotoxicity in adult female zebrafish (Danio rerio), embryos were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb atrazine during embryogenesis (1–72 h post fertilization (hpf)) and raised to adults with no additional atrazine exposure. Behavioral outcomes were tested through a novel tank test, light-dark box, and open field test and indicated female zebrafish had more anxious phenotypes at 9 months post fertilization (mpf). Female brain transcriptomic analysis at 9 mpf found altered gene expression pathways related to organismal injury and cancer with beta-estradiol and estrogen receptor as top upstream regulators. These results were compared to 9 mpf male and 6 mpf female groups with the same atrazine embryonic exposures and showed differences in specific genes that were altered, but similarities in top molecular pathways. Molecular pathways associated with behavior were observed only in the 6 mpf transcriptomic profiles, suggesting prediction of observed behavioral outcomes at 9 mpf. The expression of genes associated with serotonin neurotransmission was also evaluated at 14 mpf to determine persistence; however, no significant changes were observed. Brain global methylation in 12 mpf zebrafish observed an increased percent 5 mC in females with embryonic 0.3 ppb atrazine exposure. Finally, the body length, body weight, and brain weight were determined at 14 mpf and were altered in all treatment groups. These results indicate that embryonic atrazine exposure does cause delayed neurotoxicity within the DOHaD framework, which is significant given atrazine's presence and persistence in the environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Automated in vivo compound screening with zebrafish and the discovery and validation of PD 81,723 as a novel angiogenesis inhibitor
AB  - Angiogenesis is a critical process in tumor progression. Inhibition of angiogenesis by blocking VEGF signaling can impair existing tumor vessels and halt tumor progression. However, the benefits are transient, and most patients who initially respond to these therapies develop resistance. Accordingly, there is a need for new anti-angiogenesis therapeutics to delay the processes of resistance or eliminate the resistive effects entirely. This manuscript presents the results of a screen of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collections Libraries I & II (NIHCCLI&II) for novel angiogenesis inhibitors. The 727 compounds of the NIHCCLI&II library were screened with a high-throughput drug discovery platform (HTP) developed previously with angiogenesis-specific protocols utilizing zebrafish. The screen resulted in 14 hit compounds that were subsequently narrowed down to one, with PD 81,723 chosen as the lead compound. PD 81,723 was validated as an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo in zebrafish and in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Zebrafish exposed to PD 81,723 exhibited several signs of a diminished endothelial network due to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Immunochemical analysis did not reveal any significant apoptotic or mitotic activity in the zebrafish. Assays with cultured HUVECs elucidated the ability of PD 81,723 to inhibit capillary tube formation, migration, and proliferation of endothelial cells. In addition, PD 81,723 did not induce apoptosis while significantly down regulating p21, AKT, VEGFR-2, p-VEGFR-2, eNOS, and p-eNOS, with no notable change in endogenous VEGF-A in cultured HUVECs. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Toxicity mechanisms regulating bone differentiation and development defects following abnormal expressions of miR-30c targeted by triclosan in zebrafish
AB  - As a ubiquitous environmental estrogen-disrupting chemical, triclosan (TCS) can induce severe osteotoxicity; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain uncertain. Herein, we evaluated the toxic effects of TCS on the development of cartilage and osteogenesis in 5-dpf zebrafish. Under TCS exposure from 62.5 to 250 μg/L, several osteodevelopmental malformations were observed, such as defect of craniofacial cartilage, pharyngeal arch cartilage dysplasia, and impairments on skeletal mineralization. Further, the morphology of mature chondrocytes became swollen and deformed, their number decreased, nucleus displacement occurred, and most immature chondrocytes were crowded at both ends of ceratobranchial. SEM observation of larval caudal fin revealed that, the layer of collagen fibers and the mineralized calcium nodules were significantly decreased, with the collagen fibers becoming shorter upon TCS exposure. The activity of bone-derived alkaline phosphatase significantly reduced, and marker functional genes related to cartilage and osteoblast development were abnormally expressed. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis indicated, that changes in marker genes intimately related to the negative regulation of miR-30c-5p overexpression targeted by TCS, and the up-regulation of miR-30c induced bone developmental defects by inhibiting the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. These findings were confirmed by artificially intervening the expression of miR-30c and using BMP pathway agonists in vivo. In sum, TCS induced osteototoxicity by targeting miR-30c up-regulation and interfering in the BMP signaling pathway. These findings enhance mechanistic understanding of TCS-induced spontaneous bone disorders and bone metastatic diseases. Further research is necessary to monitor chronic TCS-exposure levels in surrounding environments and develop relevant safety precautions based on TCS environmental risk. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Toxic effects of four cardiovascular drugs on the development and epigenetics of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, therapeutic drugs such as atenolol (ATE), metoprolol (MET), atorvastatin (ATO), and bezafibrate (BZB) have been widely used and thus frequently detected in surface water at ng·L−1–μg·L−1 level. In this study, the developmental toxicity of these drugs (0.5 μg·L−1–500 μg·L−1) to zebrafish, an aquatic model organism, was investigated; and the epigenetic toxicity of BZB was also explored. For all four drugs, the results showed that the drugs exposure could cause sublethal toxic effects on zebrafish larvae, such as decreases in hatching rate, body length, and heart rate. ATO also induced the swelling of the eyes of larvae by 5 %–15 %. Yolk sac edema, pericardial edema, bent spine, and tail malformation were observed in larvae exposed to the drugs, and yolk sac edema was the most common malformation. In addition, the spontaneous movement and free-swimming activity could be inhibited by the drugs. Combined with RNA-seq results, the adverse development of larvae in exposure groups may be caused by the disruption of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and the development and function of eye and nervous system. After a 30-day uptake period, the accumulation of BZB and the decrease of global DNA methylation level were observed in the liver, kidneys, gut, gills, and brain of adult zebrafish (4-month-old) exposed to 0.5 μg·L−1 to 500 μg·L−1 BZB. The liver was the main organ for BZB accumulation and the occurrence of DNA hypomethylation. In the liver, overexpression (1.5–7.6 times) of genes related to lipid metabolism (PPARα), DNA methylation (Dnmt1), and apoptosis (p53) was also observed. The results of the current study suggest that long-term exposure to low-concentrations of cardiovascular drugs may pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The role of exposure window and dose in determining lead toxicity in developing Zebrafish
AB  - Heavy metal contamination is recognized worldwide as a serious threat to human health and wildlife, and reducing their emissions is a priority of international and EU actions. Due to its persistence, high bioaccumulation tendency, and toxicity properties, lead (Pb) is one of the heavy metals of greatest concern. Even at low concentrations, lead induces various clinical and subclinical conditions in both humans and animals, and it has been included in the priority list of hazardous substances. In the present study, we used zebrafish's early stages as a model, given their well-acknowledged predictive value in the risk assessment of chemicals. This study was designed to investigate the morphological and morphometric alterations induced by Pb during zebrafish's early development and disclose the putative effects stage- and/or dose-dependent. We examined injuries induced by two environmentally relevant and extremely low concentrations of Pb (2.5 μg/L and 5 μg/L) during two exposure windows: early (between 1 and 7 dpf) and late (between 2 and 8 dpf). We clearly demonstrated that the incidence and severity of morphological abnormalities increased with increasing Pb dose and exposure time in both early and late-exposed groups. Furthermore, we revealed that malformation severity was significantly higher in the early exposed group than in the late exposure group at all exposure times and for both tested doses, thus highlighting the high sensitivity of zebrafish during the initial stages of development. The information presented in this paper emphasizes the effectiveness of morphological biomarkers in unveiling threatening situations and supports the role of zebrafish embryos and larvae in risk assessment and environmental monitoring. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Background per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in laboratory fish diet: Implications for zebrafish toxicological studies
AB  - Current attention is focused on determining the potential for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to adversely impact human health. Zebrafish are a popular biological model because they share early development pathways with humans. A dietary exposure paradigm is growing in popularity in the zebrafish model because the outcomes often translate to humans. To create a diet of known composition, it is crucial to understand background PFAS levels present in zebrafish diet. Background PFAS, if present, potentially confounds interpretation of toxicological data. To date, no studies document the PFAS background levels in laboratory fish diet and there is only limited information on some pet foods. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an analytical method for up to 50 target PFAS in high lipid and protein content laboratory fish diets and pet foods. Long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (C9-C13) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were quantified in 11 out of 16 laboratory fish diets and in three out of five pet fish foods. Foods for pet birds, lizards, and dogs were below the limit of detection for all PFAS. In two of the laboratory fish diets, PFOS concentrations were >1.3 ng/g and the total PFAS for the three laboratory fish diets exceeded 1.0 ng/g. Hundreds of biomedical laboratories across the world utilize these commercial laboratory fish diets, and these results indicate that numerous zebrafish colonies may be inadvertently receiving significant dietary PFAS exposures. In light of this new information, it is critical to design PFAS studies with appropriate controls with measured background PFAS concentrations in the diet and to urge caution when interpreting the results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Highly sensitive and group-targeting detection of steroid estrogens in water environment using a valid oligonucleotide class-specific editing technique
AB  - Steroid environmental estrogens (SEEs) are often coexist in water, require complex analytical techniques for separation and monitoring. However, aptamer-based chemical detection often only recognizes one of them, and the detection of SEEs is still a huge challenge. Herein, a group-targeting aptamer with the ability to recognize SEEs was constructed using efficient oligonucleotide class-specific editing technology, and a photoelectrochemical aptasensor capable of detecting the class of SEEs was established. A quantitative analysis of highly toxic SEEs in the environment and carrying similar core carbon skeleton, including 17β-estradiol, esterone, estriol and ethinylestradiol, was performed. The detection limit was as low as 0.1 nM with a response time of only 15 min. Specifically, this method exhibited high anti-interference with different complex media existing. Combining the theoretical calculations with a variety of spectral experiments, the Π-Π stacking and hydrogen bond synergistic interactions between the photoelectric interface and the three ring structures on SEEs and the hydroxyl group of ring 1 were analyzed in depth. Besides, the conformational changes of loose base helix structure and the free rotation limitation of oligonucleotides after the recognition of SEEs at the molecular level were also elucidated, facilitating the transfer of electrons on the surface of the photoelectrode. © 2022

TI  - Disruptions of circadian rhythms, sleep, and stress responses in zebrafish: New infrared-based activity monitoring assays for toxicity assessment
AB  - Behavioural disruptions are sensitive indicators of alterations to normal animal physiology and can be used for toxicity assessment. The small vertebrate zebrafish is a leading model organism for toxicological studies. The ability to continuously monitor the toxicity of drugs, pollutants, or environmental changes over several days in zebrafish can have high practical application. Although video-recordings can be used to monitor short-term zebrafish behaviour, it is challenging to videorecord prolonged experiments (e.g. circadian behaviour over several days) because of the darkness periods (nights) and the heavy data storage and image processing requirements. Alternatively, infrared-based activity monitors, widely used in invertebrate models such as drosophila, generate simple and low-storage data and could optimize large-scale prolonged behavioural experiments in zebrafish, thus favouring the implementation of high-throughput testing strategies. Here, we validate the use of a Locomotor Activity Monitor (LAM) to study the behaviour of zebrafish larvae, and we characterize the behavioural phenotypes induced by abnormal light conditions and by the Parkinsonian toxin MPP+. When zebrafish were deprived from daily light-cycle synchronization, the LAM detected various circadian disruptions, such as increased activity period, phase shifts, and decreased inter-daily stability. Zebrafish exposed to MPP+ (10, 100, 500 μM) showed a concentration-dependent decrease in activity, sleep disruptions, impaired habituation to repetitive startles (visual-motor responses), and a slower recovery to normal activity after the startle-associated stress. These phenotypes evidence the feasibility of using infrared-based LAM to assess multi-parameter behavioural disruptions in zebrafish. The procedures in this study have wide applicability and may yield standard methods for toxicity testing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Acetaminophen Disrupts the Development of Pharyngeal Arch-Derived Cartilage and Muscle in Zebrafish
AB  - Acetaminophen is a common analgesic, but its potential effects on early embryonic development are not well understood. Previous studies using zebrafish (Danio rerio) have described the effects of acetaminophen on liver development and physiology, and a few have described gross physiological and morphological defects. Using a high but non-embryonic lethal dose of acetaminophen, we probed for defects in zebrafish craniofacial cartilage development. Strikingly, acetaminophen treatment caused severe craniofacial cartilage defects, primarily affecting both the presence and morphology of pharyngeal arch-derived cartilages of the viscerocranium. Delaying acetaminophen treatment restored developing cartilages in an order correlated with their corresponding pharyngeal arches, suggesting that acetaminophen may target pharyngeal arch development. Craniofacial cartilages are derived from cranial neural crest cells; however, many neural crest cells were still seen along their expected migration paths, and most remaining cartilage precursors expressed the neural crest markers sox9a and sox10, then eventually col2a1 (type II collagen). Therefore, the defects are not primarily due to an early breakdown of neural crest or cartilage differentiation. Instead, apoptosis is increased around the developing pharyngeal arches prior to chondrogenesis, further suggesting that acetaminophen may target pharyngeal arch development. Many craniofacial muscles, which develop in close proximity to the affected cartilages, were also absent in treated larvae. Taken together, these results suggest that high amounts of acetaminophen can disrupt multiple aspects of craniofacial development in zebrafish. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Cyclophosphamide alters the behaviors of adult Zebrafish via neurotransmitters and gut microbiota
AB  - Cyclophosphamide, one of the earliest prescribed alkylating anticancer drugs, has been frequently detected in aquatic environments. However, its effects on fish behavior and associated mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, the behaviors, neurochemicals, and gut microbiota of adult zebrafish were investigated after 2 months of exposure to CP at 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 µg/L. Behavioral assays revealed that CP increased locomotion and anxiety, and decreased the cognition of zebrafish. The alteration of neurotransmitters and related gene expressions in the dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid pathways induced by CP may be responsible for the observed changes in locomotion and cognition of adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, CP increased the anxiety of adult zebrafish through the serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine pathways in the brain. In addition, increased abundances of Fusobacteriales, Reyanellales, Staphylococcales, Rhodobacterals, and Patescibateria in the intestine at the CP-50 treatment were observed. The study has demonstrated that CP affects the locomotion, anxiety, and cognition in zebrafish, which might be linked with the dysfunction of neurochemicals in the brain. This study further suggests that the gut-brain axis might interact to modulate fish behaviors upon exposure to CP (maybe other organic pollutants). Further research is warranted to test this hypothesis. © 2022

TI  - Neurotoxicity of nanoparticles: Insight from studies in zebrafish
AB  - Nanoparticles are widely used in industry and personal care, and they inevitably end up in people's bodies and the environment. The widespread use of nanoparticles has raised new concerns about their neurotoxicity, as nanoparticles can enter the nervous system by blood-brain barrier. In neurotoxicity testing, the zebrafish provides powerful tools to overcome the limitations of other models. This paper will provide a comprehensive review of the power of zebrafish in neurotoxicity tests and the neurotoxic effects of nanoparticles, including inorganic, organic, and metal-based nanoparticles, on zebrafish from different perspectives. Such information can be used to predict not only the effects of nanoparticles on other species exposed to the aquatic environment but also the neurotoxicity of nanoparticles in humans. © 2022

TI  - Three-dimensional (3D) liver cell models - a tool for bridging the gap between animal studies and clinical trials when screening liver accumulation and toxicity of nanobiomaterials
AB  - Despite the exciting properties and wide-reaching applications of nanobiomaterials (NBMs) in human health and medicine, their translation from bench to bedside is slow, with a predominant issue being liver accumulation and toxicity following systemic administration. In vitro 2D cell-based assays and in vivo testing are the most popular and widely used methods for assessing liver toxicity at pre-clinical stages; however, these fall short in predicting toxicity for NBMs. Focusing on in vitro and in vivo assessment, the accurate prediction of human-specific hepatotoxicity is still a significant challenge to researchers. This review describes the relationship between NBMs and the liver, and the methods for assessing toxicity, focusing on the limitations they bring in the assessment of NBM hepatotoxicity as one of the reasons defining the poor translation for NBMs. We will then present some of the most recent advances towards the development of more biologically relevant in vitro liver methods based on tissue-mimetic 3D cell models and how these could facilitate the translation of NBMs going forward. Finally, we also discuss the low public acceptance and limited uptake of tissue-mimetic 3D models in pre-clinical assessment, despite the demonstrated technical and ethical advantages associated with them.

TI  - Inflammation aggravated the hepatotoxicity of triptolide by oxidative stress, lipid metabolism disorder, autophagy, and apoptosis in zebrafish
AB  - Triptolide is a major compound isolated from the Tripterygium wilfordii Hook that is mainly used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases. Though triptolide-induced hepatotoxicity has been widely reported, the hepatic effects when the patients are in an inflammatory state are not clear. In this study, we used low-dose Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to disrupt the inflammation homeostasis in the liver of zebrafish and explored the hepatotoxicity of triptolide under an inflammatory state. Compared with the Triptolide group, LPS-Triptolide cotreatment exacerbate the liver injury with a remarkable decrease of liver size and liver-specific fluorescence intensity, accompanied by significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Liver cell damages were further demonstrated by histological staining and scanning electron microscopy observation. Lipid metabolism was severely impaired as indicated by delayed yolk sac absorption, accumulated triglycerides in the liver, and dysregulation of the related genes, such as ppar-α, cpt-1, mgst, srebf1/2, and fasn. Oxidative stress could be involved in the molecular mechanism as the Nrf2/keap1 antioxidant pathways were down-regulated when the zebrafish in an inflammatory state. Moreover, the expression of autophagy-related genes such as beclin, atg5, map1lc3b, and atg3 was also dysregulated. Finally, apoptosis was significantly induced in responses to LPS-Triptolide co-treatment. We speculate that triptolide could exacerbate the immune response and impair lipid metabolism, resulting in enhanced sensitivity of the zebrafish liver to triptolide-induced toxic effects through disruption of the antioxidant system and induction of apoptosis.

TI  - Benzoresorcinol induces developmental neurotoxicity and injures exploratory, learning and memorizing abilities in zebrafish
AB  - Benzophenones (BPs) are a class of UV absorber commonly used in skin care products like sunscreens. With its wide range of application, its environmental and human hazards have received much attention in recent days. Previous studies on the toxicity of BPs mainly focused on its endocrine-disrupting effects, but there are limited studies on its neurodevelopment and neurotoxicity. Herein, using the zebrafish model we studied the neurodevelopmental- and neuro-toxicity of benzophenone 1 (BP1) (0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.4 μg/mL). As a result, BP1 led to an increase of embryo mortality, a decrease in hatching rate, and an increase in the rate of developmental abnormalities in a concentration-dependent manner. BP1 also caused developmental defects in the central nervous system (CNS) and dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Accordingly, BP1 injured larval zebrafish general locomotion and response to stimuli in light/dark challenge. In adult zebrafish, BP1 exposure (1, 10, 100, 1000 μg/L) caused inhibition of learning and memory abilities in the T-maze tests, and inhibited exploratory behavior and activity in the novel tank diving tests. Further, transcription levels of genes related to neurotoxicity, neurodevelopment, and anxiety revealed that BP1 may affect the development and function of the myelin sheath, inducing structural and functional defects of CNS, manifested as abnormal behaviors such as anxiety. Hence, the current study revealed the neurodevelopmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of BP1, expanded our knowledge about the toxic effects of BP1 on organisms, posing a possible threat to the environment and human health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Quantification of Idua Enzymatic Activity Combined with Observation of Phenotypic Change in Zebrafish Embryos Provide a Preliminary Assessment of Mutated idua Correlated with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I
AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutation of the α-l-Iduronidase (IDUA) gene. New unknown mutated nucleotides of idua have increasingly been discovered in newborn screening, and remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that the z-Idua enzymatic activity of zebrafish idua-knockdown embryos was reduced, resulting in the accumulation of undegradable metabolite of heparin sulfate, as well as increased mortality and defective phenotypes similar to some symptoms of human MPS I. After microinjecting mutated z-idua-L346R, -T364M, -E398-deleted, and -E540-frameshifted mRNAs, corresponding to mutated human IDUA associated with MPS I, into zebrafish embryos, no increase in z-Idua enzymatic activity, except of z-idua-E540-frameshift-injected embryos, was noted compared with endogenous z-Idua of untreated embryos. Defective phenotypes were observed in the z-idua-L346R-injected embryos, suggesting that failed enzymatic activity of mutated z-Idua-L346R might have a dominant negative effect on endogenous z-Idua function. However, defective phenotypes were not observed in the z-idua-E540-frameshifted-mRNA-injected embryos, which provided partial enzymatic activity. Based on these results, we suggest that the z-Idua enzyme activity assay combined with phenotypic observation of mutated-idua-injected zebrafish embryos could serve as an alternative platform for a preliminary assessment of mutated idua not yet characterized for their role in MPS I. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluation of Locomotion Complexity in Zebrafish after Exposure to Twenty Antibiotics by Fractal Dimension and Entropy Analysis
AB  - Antibiotics are extensively used in aquaculture to prevent bacterial infection and the spread of diseases. Some antibiotics have a relatively longer half-life in water and may induce some adverse effects on the targeted fish species. This study analyzed the potential adverse effects of antibiotics in zebrafish at the behavioral level by a phenomic approach. We conducted three-dimensional (3D) locomotion tracking for adult zebrafish after acute exposure to twenty different antibiotics at a concentration of 100 ppb for 10 days. Their locomotor complexity was analyzed and compared by fractal dimension and permutation entropy analysis. The dimensionality reduction method was performed by combining the data gathered from behavioral endpoints alteration. Principal component and hierarchical analysis conclude that three antibiotics: amoxicillin, trimethoprim, and tylosin, displayed unique characteristics. The effects of these three antibiotics at lower concentrations (1 and 10 ppb) were observed in a follow-up study. Based on the results, these antibiotics can trigger several behavioral alterations in adult zebrafish, even in low doses. Significant changes in locomotor behavioral activity, such as total distance activity, average speed, rapid movement time, angular velocity, time in top/bottom duration, and meandering movement are highly related to neurological motor impairments, anxiety levels, and stress responses were observed. This study provides evidence based on an in vivo experiment to support the idea that the usage of some antibiotics should be carefully addressed since they can induce a significant effect of behavioral alterations in fish. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Morphological and Functional Alterations Induced by Two Ecologically Relevant Concentrations of Lead on Danio rerio Gills
AB  - Lead (Pb), due to its high toxicity and bioaccumulation tendency, is one of the top three pollutants of concern for both humans and wildlife and occupies second place in the Priority List of Hazardous Substances. In freshwater fish, Pb is mainly absorbed through the gills, where the greatest accumulation occurs. Despite the crucial role of gills in several physiological functions such as gas exchange, water balance, and osmoregulation, no studies evaluated the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb on this organ, and existing literature only refers to high levels of exposure. Herein we investigated for the first time the molecular and morphological effects induced by two low and environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb (2.5 and 5 μg/L) on the gills of Danio rerio, a model species with a high translational value for human toxicity. It was demonstrated that Pb administration at even low doses induces osmoregulatory dysfunctions by affecting Na+/K+-ATPase and AQP3 expression. It was also shown that Pb upregulates MTs as a protective response to prevent cell damage. Modulation of SOD confirms that the production of reactive oxygen species is an important toxicity mechanism of Pb. Histological and morphometric analysis revealed conspicuous pathological changes, both dose- and time-dependent. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Phototactic behaviour and neurotransmitter profiles in two Daphnia magna clones: Vertical and horizontal responses to fish kairomones and psychotropic drugs
AB  - Animal behavioural responses are increasingly being used in environmental risk assessment. Nevertheless, behavioural responses are still hampered by a lack of standardisation. Phototactic behaviour in zooplankton and in particular in Daphnia has often been associated to vertical migration but there is also ‘shore-avoidance’ horizontal behaviour: Daphnia uses shades along the shore to swim either to or away from the shore and predators. Previously, we develop a vertical oriented behavioural hardware able to reproduce phototactic fish induced depth selection in Daphnia magna, its modulation by fish kairomones and psychotropic drugs and the neurotransmitter profiles associated to those responses. This study aims to test if it is possible to use an horizontal 24 multi-well plate maze set up to assess phototactic fish induced responses in D. magna. The study was conducted using two clones with opposed phototaxis upon exposure to fish kairomones and using psychotropic drugs known to modulate phototaxis. Acrylic strips opaque to visible light but not to the infrared one were used to cover half of the arena of each of the wells of the multi-well plate. Clone P132,85 showed positive phototaxis in either the vertical and horizontal set up and negative phototaxis when exposed to fish kairomones or to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist's scopolamine and atropine. The opposite behaviour was observed for clone F. Diazepam and pilocarpine ameliorate fish kairomone induced negative phototaxis and picrotoxin increased it only in clone P132,85 in the vertical set up. The determination of neurotransmitters showed much greater concentrations of dopamine and of glycine in clone F, which may be relate to its negative phototaxis and its observed lower responsiveness to fish kairomones. The results from this study suggest a simple, fast, and high throughput phototactic behaviour assay for D. magna that can be easily adapted to other species. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Dietary Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) Exposures in Juvenile Zebrafish Produce Subtle Behavioral Effects across Generations
AB  - Ubiquitous anthropogenic contaminants of concern, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are frequently detected in the environment and human populations around the world. Diet is a predominate route of human exposure, and PFAS are frequently measured in food. Manufacturing trends have shifted from legacy PFAS to shorter-chain alternatives that are suggested to be safer, such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). However, the current amount of data to support safety assessments of these alternatives is not yet sufficient. The present study investigated the effects of a 42-day dietary exposure to 1, 10, or 100 ng/g PFHxA in juvenile zebrafish. The zebrafish model was leveraged to interrogate morphometrics, fecundity, and numerous behavior endpoints across multiple generations. Dietary PFHxA exposure did not result in measurable body burden and did not affect growth, fecundity, adult social perception behavior, or associative learning. PFHxA exposure did induce abnormal adult anxiety behaviors in the F0 generation that persisted transgenerationally in the F1 and F2. Abnormal larval and juvenile behavior was observed in the F1 generation, but not in the F2. PFHxA juvenile dietary exposure induced subtle and multigenerational behavior effects that warrant further investigation of this and other alternative short-chain PFAS. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Developmental Toxic Effects of Thiram on Developing Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Embryos
AB  - Thiram, an oxidized dimer of dithiocarbamate, has fungicidal and ectoparasiticidal roles. This study aimed to determine the effects of thiram on the development of zebrafish (ZF) embryos. The developmental toxicity test was performed in accordance with the OECD 236 test guidelines, and ZF embryos were subjected to several thiram concentrations and a DMSO (0.01%) control. Subsequently, embryo mortalities and developmental anomalies were evaluated at different hours post fertilization (hpf). Thiram was highly toxic to ZF, with calculated median lethal concentrations (LC50) of thiram at 48 and 96 h as 13.10 ± 2.17 and 8.87 ± 2.09 µg/L, respectively. Thiram-treated embryos/larvae exhibited a variety of deformities, such as abnormal somites, reduced eye pigment, abnormal tail shape, yolk sac edema, hatching defects, and curved spines, with a median effective concentration (EC50) of 3.88 ± 1.23, 5.04 ± 1.82, 6.23 ± 0.92, 5.24 ± 2.22, 1.39 ± 0.25, and 2.60 ± 0.82 µg/L, respectively. Teratogenic index (TI) values ranged from 1.42 to 6.66 for the scored deformities. At 48 hpf, the average heartbeat of the control group was 177.20 ± 5.63 per minute, while the highest thiram-treated group (40 µg/L) was 99.50 ± 18.12 per minute. In addition, cardiac-related issues, such as pericardial edema and abnormal blood flow, were observed in thiram-treated ZF embryos. Overall, these findings suggest that thiram is teratogenic to ZF. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Are “liquid plastics” a new environmental threat? The case of polyvinyl alcohol
AB  - Despite the pollution induced by plastics become a well-known and documented problem, bringing many countries to adopt restrictions about their production, commercialization and use, the impact of another emerging category of synthetic polymers, represented by the Water-Soluble Polymers (WSPs), also known as “liquid plastics”, is overlooked by scientific community. WSPs are produced in large quantities and used in a wide plethora of applications such as food packaging, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, cosmetics and detergents, with a consequent continuous release in the environment. The aim of this study was the investigation of the possible toxicity induced by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), one of the main produced and used WSPs, on two freshwater model organisms, the crustacean Daphnia magna and the teleost Danio rerio (zebrafish). We evaluated the effects of solubilized standard PVA powder and PVA-based commercial bags for carp-fishing, at 3 different concentrations (1 µg/L, 0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L), through the exposures for 14 days of D. magna (daphnids; age < 24 h) and for 5 days of zebrafish embryos (up to 120 h post fertilization - hpf). As acute effects we evaluated the immobilization/mortality of specimens, while for chronic toxicity we selected several endpoints with a high ecological relevance, as the behavioural alteration on swimming performance, in real-time readout, and the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO), a neuro-enzyme with a potential implication in the organism movement. The results showed the lack of significant effects induced by the selected substances, at all tested concentrations and in both model organisms. However, considering the wide plethora of available WSPs, other investigations are needed to provide the initial knowledge of risk assessment of these compounds contained in some consumer products. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Transgenerational effects of parental bisphenol S exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio) reproduction
AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) is extensively used for production of polycarbonates and other commodities, and is often detected in environment and biota. Parental BPS exposure has been reported to interfere with reproductive development of offspring, but limited information is available on its multigenerational reproductive toxicity. In our present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to BPS (1 and 100 μg/L) from 3 hpf to 120 dpf, and the effects on reproduction, sex steroid hormones, DNA methylation levels and gene transcription involved in steroidogenesis and DNA methylation were investigated in unexposed F1-2 offspring. The results showed that 100 μg/L BPS exposure increased DNA methylation in F1 testes, and 1 μg/L BPS led to DNA methylation in F2 ovaries. The increased DNA methylation levels led to decreased expression of steroidogenic enzymes, including cyp11a, cyp17 and 3βhsd, which might be a main reason for the elevated plasma 17β-estradiol and decreased testosterone levels. In addition, sex ratio indicated a female dominance trend, and reproductive capacity of male fish was severely impaired. Overall, these findings suggest that parental BPS exposure impairs reproductive development of unexposed offspring via DNA methylation and BPS-induced epigenetic modification inheritance has a long-term effect on the fitness and sustainability of fish populations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Hydrogen sulfide-induced oxidative stress mediated apoptosis via mitochondria pathway in embryo-larval stages of zebrafish
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a highly toxic gas, has become a polluting gas that cannot be ignored, while H2S exposure results in acute or chronic poisoning or even death in humans or animals and plants, but the relevant mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, 9-day-old zebrafish larvae were exposed continuously to culture medium containing 30 μM survival rate was counted on H2S, and our results indicated that H2S exposure increased intracellular ROS, Ca2+, NO and MDA contents and decreased SOD activity, meaning that H2S caused oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that transgenic zebrafish (cms Tg/+ AB) displayed a lower fluorescence intensity, and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and JC-1 monomer fluorescence ratio increased under H2S treatment conditions. These findings indicated that H2S caused mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, in this experiment, after H2S treatment, the increase of apoptotic cells, activity of caspase 3 and transcription of typical apoptosis-associated genes including BCL2 associated agonist of cell death (Bad), and BCL2 associated X apoptosis (Baxa) and so on were found, which suggested that H2S caused apoptosis in zebrafish larvae. Therefore, our data meant that H2S-traggered oxidative stress mediate mitochondrial dysfunction, thus triggering apoptosis. In conclusion, oxidative stress triggered H2S-induced apoptosis via mitochondria pathway in embryo-larval stages of zebrafish. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Loss-of-Function Models of the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Genes Grm8a and Grm8b Display Distinct Behavioral Phenotypes in Zebrafish Larvae (Danio rerio)
AB  - Members of the family of metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in the pathomechanism of several disorders of the nervous system. Besides the well-investigated function of dysfunctional glutamate receptor signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), like autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might also be partly caused by disturbed glutamate signaling during development. However, the underlying mechanism of the type III metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGluR8 or GRM8) involvement in neurodevelopment and disease mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that the expression pattern of the two orthologs of human GRM8, grm8a and grm8b, have evolved partially distinct expression patterns in the brain of zebrafish (Danio rerio), especially at adult stages, suggesting sub-functionalization of these two genes during evolution. Using double in situ hybridization staining in the developing brain we demonstrate that grm8a is expressed in a subset of gad1a-positive cells, pointing towards glutamatergic modulation of GABAergic signaling. Building on this result we generated loss-of-function models of both genes using CRISPR/Cas9. Both mutant lines are viable and display no obvious gross morphological phenotypes making them suitable for further analysis. Initial behavioral characterization revealed distinct phenotypes in larvae. Whereas grm8a mutant animals display reduced swimming velocity, grm8b mutant animals show increased thigmotaxis behavior, suggesting an anxiety-like phenotype. We anticipate that our two novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 zebrafish models may contribute to a deeper understanding of its function in normal development and its role in the pathomechanism of disorders of the central nervous system.

TI  - Crucial proangiogenic components in Salvia miltiorrhiza based on zebrafish model and molecular docking technique [基于斑马鱼模型及分子对接技术研究丹参促进血管生成的关键活性成分]
AB  - Objective: To establish a new method to explore the potential angiogenesis-promoting active components in Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza).Methods: Transgenic zebrafish with green fluorescent protein-labeled blood vessels was used as experimental animal, and PTK787, a vascular inhibitor, was used to establish the angiogenesis inhibition model. And this kind of experimental model was used to evaluate the angiogenesis-promoting effect of S. miltiorrhiza extracts of different origins. The molecular docking technique was used to screen the potential active components of S. miltiorrhiza for pro-angiogenesis. The results of molecular docking screening were combined with the results of zebrafish activity assay to identify the key active ingredients.Results: Compared with model group, S. miltiorrhiza extracts from different origins significantly promoted intersegmental vessels development in zebrafish (P< 0.01). The lowest docking binding energy of salvianolic acid B with VHL-hypoxia inducible factor-1αcomplex was found by molecular docking screening, and the possible sites of action were initially revealed. The experiments using zebrafish model revealed that salvianolic acid B had a significant angiogenesis-promoting effect (P< 0.01). Conclusion: A new method of "virtual screening-bioactivity evaluation" based on zebrafish model was established for identification of pharmacological substances in traditional Chinese medicine. Combining computational chemistry data mining technology with zebrafish activity experiments, salvianolic acid B was discovered as one of key pro-angiogenic active ingredients in S. miltiorrhiza. The research provides a scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease and subsequent development of new drugs. © 2022, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

TI  - Systematic developmental toxicity assessment of a structurally diverse library of PFAS in zebrafish
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of widely used chemicals with limited human health effects data relative to the diversity of structures manufactured. To help fill this data gap, an extensive in vivo developmental toxicity screen was performed on 139 PFAS provided by the US EPA. Dechorionated embryonic zebrafish were exposed to 10 nominal water concentrations of PFAS (0.015–100 µM) from 6 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf). The embryos were assayed for embryonic photomotor response (EPR), larval photomotor response (LPR), and 13 morphological endpoints. A total of 49 PFAS (35%) were bioactive in one or more assays (11 altered EPR, 25 altered LPR, and 31 altered morphology). Perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA) was the only structure that was bioactive in all 3 assays, while Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) was the most potent teratogen. Low PFAS volatility was associated with developmental toxicity (p < 0.01), but no association was detected between bioactivity and five other physicochemical parameters. The bioactive PFAS were enriched for 6 supergroup chemotypes. The results illustrate the power of a multi-dimensional in vivo platform to assess the developmental (neuro)toxicity of diverse PFAS and in the acceleration of PFAS safety research. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Lanthanides Toxicity in Zebrafish Embryos Are Correlated to Their Atomic Number
AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical metallic materials with a broad application in industry and biomedicine. The exponential increase in REEs utilization might elevate the toxicity to aquatic animals if they are released into the water due to uncareful handling. The specific objective of our study is to explore comprehensively the critical factor of a model Lanthanide complex electronic structures for the acute toxicity of REEs based on utilizing zebrafish as a model animal. Based on the 96 h LC50 test, we found that the majority of light REEs display lower LC50 values (4.19–25.17 ppm) than heavy REEs (10.30–41.83 ppm); indicating that they are atomic number dependent. Later, linear regression analyses further show that the average carbon charge on the aromatic ring (aromatic Cavg charge) can be the most significant electronic structural factor responsible for the Lanthanides’ toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Our results confirm a very strong correlation of LC50 to Lanthanide’s atomic numbers (r = 0.72), Milliken charge (r = 0.70), and aromatic Cavg charge (r = −0.85). This most significant correlation suggests a possible toxicity mechanism that the Lanthanide cation’s capability to stably bind to the aromatic ring on the residue of targeted proteins via a covalent chelating bond. Instead, the increasing ionic bond character can reduce REEs’ toxicity. In addition, Lanthanide toxicity was also evaluated by observing the disruption of photo motor response (PMR) activity in zebrafish embryos. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence to demonstrate the correlation between an atomic number of Lanthanide ions and the Lanthanide toxicity to zebrafish embryos. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Pentachloronitrobenzene Reduces the Proliferative Capacity of Zebrafish Embryonic Cardiomyocytes via Oxidative Stress
AB  - Pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) is an organochlorine protective fungicide mainly used as a soil and seed fungicide. Currently, there are few reports on the toxicity of PCNB to zebrafish embryo. Here, we evaluated the toxicity of PCNB in aquatic vertebrates using a zebrafish model. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to PCNB at concentrations of 0.25 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, and 0.75 mg/L from 6 hpf to 72 hpf resulted in abnormal embryonic development, including cardiac malformation, pericardial edema, decreased heart rate, decreased blood flow velocity, deposition at yolk sac, shortened body length, and increased distance between venous sinus and arterial bulb (SV-BA). The expression of genes related to cardiac development was disordered. However, due to the unstable embryo status in the 0.75 mg/L exposure concentration group, the effect of PCNB on the expression levels of cardiac-related genes was not concentration-dependent. We found that PCNB increased reactive oxygen species stress levels in zebrafish, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and catalase (CAT) activity, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The increased level of oxidative stress reduced the proliferation ability of zebrafish cardiomyocytes, and the expressions of zebrafish proliferation-related genes such as cdk-2, cdk-6, ccnd1, and ccne1 were significantly down-regulated. Astaxanthin (AST) attenuates PCNB-induced reduction in zebrafish cardiomyocyte proliferation by reducing oxidative stress levels. Our study shows that PCNB can cause severe oxidative stress in zebrafish, thereby reducing the proliferative capacity of cardiomyocytes, resulting in zebrafish cardiotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo-larval contact assay combined with biochemical biomarkers and swimming performance in sewage sludge and hydrochar hazard assessment
AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization is considered a powerful technology to convert sewage sludge (SS) into a valuable carbonaceous solid known as hydrochar (HC). Up to now criteria for landfill application of SS and HC are based only on physicochemical properties and levels of pollutant residues. Nevertheless, to ensure their safe environmental applications it is mandatory to develop biosensors which can provide relevant information on their toxic potential for natural ecosystems. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the suitability of a contact assay using zebrafish embryo/larvae combined with sub-lethal end-points to evaluate the hazard associated with SS and related HC exposure. A suite of biomarkers was also applied on larvae, related to detoxification and oxidative stress as the activity of Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, glutathione-S-transferase, and catalase, the content of reactive oxygen species and the behavioral assay using the DanioVision™ chamber. Legacy priority pollutants were also measured either in SS and HC tested samples and in contact waters. The exposure to SS caused higher lethality compared to HC. No significant changes in the activity of oxidative stress markers was observed upon exposure to both matrices. The behavioral test showed a hypoactivity condition in larvae exposed to both SS and HC with the effects of SS stronger than HC. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of trace elements and halogenated compounds in either SS, HC. Heavy metals were also released in contact waters, while volatile hydrocarbons (C6–C10) and halogenated compounds resulted below LOD (&lt;0.05 μ L−1). Our study highlights the suitability of zebrafish embryotoxicity test, coupled with behavioral traits, as screening tool for assessing potential risks, associated with the landfill application of both SS and HC, for aquatic wildlife. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Connectivity Mapping Using a Novel sv2a Loss-of-Function Zebrafish Epilepsy Model as a Powerful Strategy for Anti-epileptic Drug Discovery
AB  - Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) regulates action potential-dependent neurotransmitter release and is commonly known as the primary binding site of an approved anti-epileptic drug, levetiracetam. Although several rodent knockout models have demonstrated the importance of SV2A for functional neurotransmission, its precise physiological function and role in epilepsy pathophysiology remains to be elucidated. Here, we present a novel sv2a knockout model in zebrafish, a vertebrate with complementary advantages to rodents. We demonstrated that 6 days post fertilization homozygous sv2a–/– mutant zebrafish larvae, but not sv2a+/– and sv2a+/+ larvae, displayed locomotor hyperactivity and spontaneous epileptiform discharges, however, no major brain malformations could be observed. A partial rescue of this epileptiform brain activity could be observed after treatment with two commonly used anti-epileptic drugs, valproic acid and, surprisingly, levetiracetam. This observation indicated that additional targets, besides Sv2a, maybe are involved in the protective effects of levetiracetam against epileptic seizures. Furthermore, a transcriptome analysis provided insights into the neuropathological processes underlying the observed epileptic phenotype. While gene expression profiling revealed only one differentially expressed gene (DEG) between wildtype and sv2a+/– larvae, there were 4386 and 3535 DEGs between wildtype and sv2a–/–, and sv2a+/– and sv2a–/– larvae, respectively. Pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis between wildtype and sv2a–/– larvae revealed several pathways and GO terms enriched amongst up- and down-regulated genes, including MAPK signaling, synaptic vesicle cycle, and extracellular matrix organization, all known to be involved in epileptogenesis and epilepsy. Importantly, we used the Connectivity map database to identify compounds with opposing gene signatures compared to the one observed in sv2a–/– larvae, to finally rescue the epileptic phenotype. Two out of three selected compounds rescued electrographic discharges in sv2a–/– larvae, while negative controls did not. Taken together, our results demonstrate that sv2a deficiency leads to increased seizure vulnerability and provide valuable insight into the functional importance of sv2a in the brain in general. Furthermore, we provided evidence that the concept of connectivity mapping represents an attractive and powerful approach in the discovery of novel compounds against epilepsy.

TI  - A chemical probe for BAG1 targets androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer through oxidative stress signaling pathway
AB  - BAG1 is a family of polypeptides with a conserved C-terminal BAG domain that functions as a nucleotide exchange factor for the molecular chaperone HSP70. BAG1 proteins also control several signaling processes including proteostasis, apoptosis, and transcription. The largest isoform, BAG1L, controls the activity of the androgen receptor (AR) and is upregulated in prostate cancer. Here, we show that BAG1L regulates AR dynamics in the nucleus and its ablation attenuates AR target gene expression especially those involved in oxidative stress and metabolism. We show that a small molecule, A4B17, that targets the BAG domain downregulates AR target genes similar to a complete BAG1L knockout and upregulates the expression of oxidative stress-induced genes involved in cell death. Furthermore, A4B17 outperformed the clinically approved antagonist enzalutamide in inhibiting cell proliferation and prostate tumor development in a mouse xenograft model. BAG1 inhibitors therefore offer unique opportunities for antagonizing AR action and prostate cancer growth. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Classification of Developmental Toxicants in a Human iPSC Transcriptomics-Based Test
AB  - Despite the progress made in developmental toxicology, there is a great need for in vitro tests that identify developmental toxicants in relation to human oral doses and blood concentrations. In the present study, we established the hiPSC-based UKK2 in vitro test and analyzed genome-wide expression profiles of 23 known teratogens and 16 non-teratogens. Compounds were analyzed at the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and at 20-fold Cmaxfor a 24 h incubation period in three independent experiments. Based on the 1000 probe sets with the highest variance and including information on cytotoxicity, penalized logistic regression with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to classify the compounds as test-positive or test-negative, reaching an area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.96, 0.92, 0.96, and 0.88, respectively. Omitting the cytotoxicity information reduced the test performance to an AUC of 0.94, an accuracy of 0.79, and a sensitivity of 0.74. A second method, which used the number of significantly deregulated probe sets to classify the compounds, resulted in a specificity of 1; however, the AUC (0.90), accuracy (0.90), and sensitivity (0.83) were inferior compared to those of the logistic regression-based procedure. Finally, no increased performance was achieved when the high test concentrations (20-fold Cmax) were used, in comparison to testing within the realistic clinical range (1-fold Cmax). In conclusion, although further optimization is required, for example, by including additional readouts and cell systems that model different developmental processes, the UKK2-test in its present form can support the early discovery-phase detection of human developmental toxicants. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Detrimental impact of fine dust on zebrafish: Investigating a protective agent against ocular-damage using in vitro and in vivo models
AB  - Pollution caused by fine dust is becoming a global problem in the aquatic environment. Many studies have investigated the hazards that fine dust may pose to terrestrial organisms; however, information on the effects on aquatic environments remain limited. In this study, the physicochemical characteristics of the fine dust associated with the captured powder or liquid state were compared using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Raw fine dust (RFD), in the captured powder state, was suspended in water (SFD), and the elemental composition, morphology, and size distribution of both were analyzed. Zebrafish were used as a model to study the effects of SFD-exposure on aquatic organisms. A fatal malformation was observed in the integuments of zebrafish exposed to SFD, specifically in the exterior and interior eye tissues. Furthermore, the exposure of SFD to Tg (flk; EGFP) zebrafish remarkably increased ocular vessel diameter expansion along with blood flow velocity. Regarding vessel diameter expansion, EA.hy926 cells exposed to SFD were adversely affected, with a significant increase in cell migration and capillary-like structure formation, which are angiogenic markers. The SFD-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo was dramatically restored to normal via α/β-adenosine isolated from the anti-angiogenic brown algae Ishige okamurae extract. Taken together, the current study presents solid evidence of the altered physicochemical characteristics of SFD compared to RFD, and the detrimental impact of SFD in an aquatic in vivo zebrafish model. In addition, the protective effect of α/β-adenosine, a marine natural product, on SFD-induced angiogenesis suggests that it can be used as an agent to reduce the adverse effects of SFD on aquatic animals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Simvastatin and Muscle: Zebrafish and Chicken Show that the Benefits are not Worth the Damage
AB  - Simvastatin is one of the most common medicines prescribed to treat human hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin acts through the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Unfortunately, simvastatin causes unwanted side effects on muscles, such as soreness, tiredness, or weakness. Therefore, to understand the mechanism of action of simvastatin, it is important to study its physiological and structural impacts on muscle in varied animal models. Here we report on the effects of simvastatin on two biological models: zebrafish embryos and chicken muscle culture. In the last years, our group and others showed that simvastatin treatment in zebrafish embryos reduces fish movements and induces major structural alterations in skeletal muscles. We also showed that simvastatin and membrane cholesterol depletion induce major changes in proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells in chick muscle cultures. Here, we review and discuss these observations considering reported data on the use of simvastatin as a potential therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Deep-sea specimens of Synoicum sp. were collected during a 2011 cruise of the R/V Nathanial B. Palmer to the southern Scotia Arc, Antarctica. Crude extracts from the invertebrates obtained during the cruise were screened in a zebrafish-based phenotypic assay. The Synoicum sp. extract induced embryonic dysmorphology characterized by axis truncation, leading to the isolation of aminopyrimidine substituted indolone (1–4) and indole (5–12) alkaloids. While the primary bioactivity tracked with previously reported meridianins A–G (5–11), further investigation resulted in the isolation and characterization of australindolones A–D (1–4) and the previously unreported meridianin H (12). © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluation of Zebrafish DNA Integrity after Individual and Combined Exposure to TiO2 Nanoparticles and Lincomycin
AB  - Environmental contamination by nanoparticles (NPs) and drugs represents one of the most debated issues of the last years. The aquatic biome and, indirectly, human health are strongly influenced by the negative effects induced by the widespread presence of pharmaceutical products in wastewater, mainly due to the massive use of antibiotics and inefficient treatment of the waters. The present study aimed to evaluate the harmful consequences due to exposure to antibiotics and NPs, alone and in combination, in the aquatic environment. By exploiting some of their peculiar characteristics, such as small size and ability to bind different types of substances, NPs can carry drugs into the body, showing potential genotoxic effects. The research was conducted on zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed in vivo to lincomycin (100 mg/L) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) (10 µg/L) for 7 and 14 exposure days. The effects on zebrafish were evaluated in terms of cell viability, DNA fragmentation, and genomic template stability (GTS%) investigated using Trypan blue staining, TUNEL assay, and the random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD PCR) technique, respectively. Our results show that after TiO2 NPs exposure, as well as after TiO2 NPs and lincomycin co-exposure, the percentage of damaged DNA significantly increased and cell viability decreased. On the contrary, exposure to lincomycin alone caused only a GTS% reduction after 14 exposure days. Therefore, the results allow us to assert that genotoxic effect in target cells could be through a synergistic effect, also potentially mediated by the establishment of intermolecular interactions between lincomycin and TiO2 NPs. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Impact of test chamber design on spontaneous behavioral responses of model crustacean zooplankton Artemia franciscana
AB  - The use of small aquatic model organisms to investigate the behavioral effects of chemical exposure is becoming an integral component of aquatic ecotoxicology research and neuroactive drug discovery. Despite the increasing use of invertebrates for behavioral phenotyping in toxicological studies and chemical risk assessments, little is known regarding the potential for environmental factors—such as geometry, size, opacity and depth of test chambers—to modulate common behavioral responses. In this work, we demonstrate that test chamber geometry, size, opacity and depth can affect spontaneous, unstimulated behavioral responses of euryhaline crustacean Artemia franciscana first instar larval stages. We found that in the absence of any obvious directional cues, A. franciscana exhibited a strong innate wall preference behavior. Using different test chamber sizes and geometries, we found both increased wall preference and lowered overall distance traveled by the test shrimp in a smaller chamber with sharper-angled vertices. It was also determined through quantifiable changes in the chambers’ color that the A. franciscana early larval stages can perceive, differentiate and react to differences in color or perhaps rather to light transmittance of the test chambers. The interaction between innate edge preference and positive phototaxis could be consistently altered with a novel photic stimulus system. We also observed a strong initial preference for depth in A. franciscana first instar larval stages, which diminished through the acclimatization. We postulate that the impact of test chamber designs on neurobehavioral baseline responses warrants further investigation, in particular considering the increased interest in behavioral eco-neurotoxicology applications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

TI  - Sulfonamide functional head on short-chain perfluorinated substance drives developmental toxicity
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitously detected in environmental and biological samples and cause adverse health effects. Studies have predominately focused on long-chain PFAS, with far fewer addressing short-chain alternatives. This study leveraged embryonic zebrafish to investigate developmental toxicity of a short-chain series: perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA), and 4:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (4:2 FTS). Following static exposures at 8 h postfertilization (hpf) to each chemical (1–100 μM), morphological and behavioral endpoints were assessed at 24 and 120 hpf. Only FBSA induced abnormal morphology, while exposure to all chemicals caused aberrant larval behavior. RNA sequencing at 48 hpf following 47 μM exposures revealed only FBSA significantly disrupted normal gene expression. Measured tissue concentrations were FBSA > PFBS > 4:2 FTS > PFPeA. This study demonstrates functional head groups impact bioactivity and bioconcentration. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Zebrafish Model-Based Assessment of Indoxyl Sulfate-Induced Oxidative Stress and Its Impact on Renal and Cardiac Development
AB  - Kidney disease patients may have concurrent chronic kidney disease-associated mineral bone disorder and hypertension. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neuropathy occur due to kidney failure-induced accumulation of uremic toxins in the body. Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a product of indole metabolism in the liver, is produced from tryptophan by the intestinal flora and is ultimately excreted through the kidneys. Hemodialysis helps renal failure patients eliminate many nephrotoxins, except for IS, which leads to a poor prognosis. Although the impacts of IS on cardiac and renal development have been well documented using mouse and rat models, other model organisms, such as zebrafish, have rarely been studied. The zebrafish genome shares at least 70% similarity with the human genome; therefore, zebrafish are ideal model organisms for studying vertebrate development, including renal development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of IS on the development of zebrafish embryos, especially cardiac and renal development. At 24 h postfertilization (hpf), zebrafish were exposed to IS at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 10 mM. IS reduced survival and the hatching rate, caused cardiac edema, increased mortality, and shortened the body length of zebrafish embryos. In addition, IS decreased heart rates and renal function. IS affected zebrafish development via the ROS and MAPK pathways, which subsequently led to inflammation in the embryos. The results suggest that IS interferes with cardiac and renal development in zebrafish embryos, providing new evidence about the toxicity of IS to aquatic organisms and new insights for the assessment of human health risks. Accordingly, we suggest that zebrafish studies can ideally complement mouse model studies to allow the simultaneous and comprehensive investigation of the physiological impacts of uremic endotheliotoxins, such as IS, on cardiac and renal development. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Transcriptomic signaling in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to environmental concentrations of glyphosate
AB  - Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] is one of the most popular herbicides worldwide. Globally, the use of glyphosate is increasing, and its residues have been found in drinking water and food products. The data regarding the possible toxic effects of this herbicide are controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of glyphosate at environmental concentrations in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 100, and 1,000 µg/L glyphosate for 96 h, and mortality, heart rate, and hatching rate were evaluated. After the experiment, RNA was extracted from the embryos for transcriptional analysis. No mortality was recorded, and exposure to 100 µg/L and 1,000 µg/L of glyphosate resulted in lower heart rates at 48 h. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that glyphosate exposure induced subtle changes in gene transcription profiles. We found 30 differentially expressed genes; however, the highest glyphosate concentration (1,000 µg/L) induced the greatest number of differentially expressed genes involved in oocyte maturation, metabolic processes, histone deacetylation, and nervous system development. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Structure-based design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a NAD+ analogue targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa NAD kinase
AB  - Multidrug resistance is a major public health problem that requires the urgent development of new antibiotics and therefore the identification of novel bacterial targets. The activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase, NADK, is essential in all bacteria tested so far, including many human pathogens that display antibiotic resistance leading to the failure of current treatments. Inhibiting NADK is therefore a promising and innovative antibacterial strategy since there is currently no drug on the market targeting this enzyme. Through a fragment-based drug design approach, we have recently developed a NAD+-competitive inhibitor of NADKs, which displayed in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we show that this compound, a di-adenosine derivative, is inactive against the NADK enzyme from the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaNADK). This lack of activity can be explained by the crystal structure of PaNADK, which was determined in complex with NADP+ in this study. Structural analysis led us to design and synthesize a benzamide adenine dinucleoside analogue, active against PaNADK. This novel compound efficiently inhibited PaNADK enzymatic activity in vitro with a Ki of 4.6 μm. Moreover, this compound reduced P. aeruginosa infection in vivo in a zebrafish model. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Perfluorononanoate and Perfluorobutane Sulfonate Induce Cardiotoxic Effects in Zebrafish
AB  - Globally, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are common artificial ingredients in industrial and consumer products. Recently, they have been shown to be an emerging human health risk. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)/perfluorononanoate and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS)/perfluorobutane sulfonate cause reproductive toxicity and hepatotoxicity, disrupt thyroid functions, and damage embryonic development in zebrafish. However, the cardiotoxic effects of PFNA and PFBS have not been fully established. We found that PFNA and PFBS exposures repress hatchability while increasing malformation and mortality in zebrafish embryos. Hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as assessment of the transgenic zebrafish line Tg(myl7:nDsRed) revealed that exposure of embryos to PFNA increases the occurrence of severe cardiac malformations relative to exposure to PFBS. Moreover, we evaluated the differential expressions of cardiac development-associated genes in response to PFNA and PFBS, which validated the potential cardiotoxic effects, consistent with cardiac dysfunctions. Overall, our findings reveal novel cardiotoxic effects of PFNA and PFBS in zebrafish, implying that they may exert some cardiotoxic effect in humans. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to show that PFNA exerts more severe cardiotoxic effects in zebrafish when compared with PFBS. Based on these findings, studies should evaluate the mechanisms of their cardiotoxic effects. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;00:1–9. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Pamiparib Induces Neurodevelopmental Defects and Cerebral Haemorrhage in Zebrafish Embryos via Inhibiting Notch Signalling
AB  - Pamiparib is a poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used in clinical studies, which can penetrate the blood–brain barrier efficiently. At present, there are few studies on its effect on vertebrate neurodevelopment. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to 1, 2 and 3 µM of Pamiparib from 6 to 72 h post-fertilisation (hpf). Results showed that pamiparib can specifically induce cerebral haemorrhage, brain atrophy and movement disorders in fish larvae. In addition, pamiparib exposure leads to downregulation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) activities, and upregulation of oxidative stress which then leads to apoptosis and disrupts the gene expression involved in the neurodevelopment, neurotransmitter pathways and Parkinson’s disease (PD) like symptoms. Meanwhile, astaxanthin can partially rescue neurodevelopmental defects by downregulating oxidative stress. After exposure to pamiparib, the Notch signalling is downregulated, and the use of an activator of Notch signalling can partially rescue neurodevelopmental toxicity. Therefore, our research indicates that pamiparib may induce zebrafish neurotoxicity by downregulating Notch signalling and provides a reference for the potential neurotoxicity of pamiparib during embryonic development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The application of zebrafish patient-derived xenograft tumor models in the development of antitumor agents
AB  - The cost of antitumor drug development is enormous, yet the clinical outcomes are less than satisfactory. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop effective drug screening methods that enable accurate, rapid, and high-throughput discovery of lead compounds in the process of preclinical antitumor drug research. An effective solution is to use the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor animal models, which are applicable for the elucidation of tumor pathogenesis and the preclinical testing of novel antitumor compounds. As a promising screening model organism, zebrafish has been widely applied in the construction of the PDX tumor model and the discovery of antineoplastic agents. Herein, we systematically survey the recent cutting-edge advances in zebrafish PDX models (zPDX) for studies of pathogenesis mechanisms and drug screening. In addition, the techniques used in the construction of zPDX are summarized. The advantages and limitations of the zPDX are also discussed in detail. Finally, the prospects of zPDX in drug discovery, translational medicine, and clinical precision medicine treatment are well presented. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - RNA-seq reveals potential gene biomarkers in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) for exposure to treated wastewater effluent
AB  - Discharged wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent greatly contributes to the generation of complex mixtures of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic environments which often contain neuropharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants that may impact neurological function. However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the neurological impacts of these exposures to aquatic organisms. In this study, caged fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed in situ in a temperate-region effluent-dominated stream (i.e., Muddy Creek) in Coralville, Iowa, USA upstream and downstream of a WWTP effluent outfall. The pharmaceutical composition of Muddy Creek was recently characterized by our team and revealed many compounds there were at a low microgram to high nanogram per liter concentration. Total RNA sequencing analysis on brain tissues revealed 280 gene isoforms that were significantly differentially expressed in male fish and 293 gene isoforms in female fish between the upstream and downstream site. Only 66 (13%) of such gene isoforms overlapped amongst male and female fish, demonstrating sex-dependent impacts on neuronal gene expression. By using a systems biology approach paired with functional enrichment analyses, we identified several potential novel gene biomarkers for treated effluent exposure that could be used to expand monitoring of environmental effects with respect to complex CEC mixtures. Lastly, when comparing the results of this study to those that relied on a single-compound approach, there was relatively little overlap in terms of gene-specific effects. This discovery brings into question the application of single-compound exposures in accurately characterizing environmental risks of complex mixtures and for gene biomarker identification. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Phagosomal Acidification Is Required to Kill Streptococcus pneumoniae in a Zebrafish Model
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a major human pathogen causing invasive disease, including community-acquired bacteraemia, and remains a leading cause of global mortality. Understanding the role of phagocytes in killing bacteria is still limited, especially in vivo. In this study, we established a zebrafish model to study the interaction between intravenously administered pneumococci and professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils, to unravel bacterial killing mechanisms employed by these immune cells. Our model confirmed the key role of polysaccharide capsule in promoting pneumococcal virulence through inhibition of phagocytosis. Conversely, we show pneumococci lacking a capsule are rapidly internalised by macrophages. Low doses of encapsulated S. pneumoniae cause near 100% mortality within 48 hours postinfection (hpi), while 50 times higher doses of unencapsulated pneumococci are easily cleared. Time course analysis of in vivo bacterial numbers reveals that while encapsulated pneumococcus proliferates to levels exceeding 105 CFU at the time of host death, unencapsulated bacteria are unable to grow and are cleared within 20 hpi. Using genetically induced macrophage depletion, we confirmed an essential role for macrophages in bacterial clearance. Additionally, we show that upon phagocytosis by macrophages, phagosomes undergo rapid acidification. Genetic and chemical inhibition of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) prevents intracellular bacterial killing and induces host death indicating a key role of phagosomal acidification in immunity to invading pneumococci. We also show that our model can be used to study the efficacy of antimicrobials against pneumococci in vivo. Collectively, our data confirm that larval zebrafish can be used to dissect killing mechanisms during pneumococcal infection in vivo and highlight key roles for phagosomal acidification in macrophages for pathogen clearance. © 2022 Tomasz K.

This led to a preclinical animal study that mimics the human body more and produces results rapidly and accurately. The zebrafish model was one such model that gave extensive, similar results to that of human conditions. Due to the number of advantages, this model became an ideal alternative for various studies where a large animal model cannot be preferred. Also, this model has been recently identified as the unique model in investigating several narrow therapeutic drugs and highly toxic drugs, proving its capability to determine several characteristics addressed in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Rupture of Brumadinho dam (Minas Gerais, Brazil): embryotoxicity in zebrafish induced by metal mixture-contaminated water
AB  - Rupture of dam B-1 at the Córrego do Feijão mine in Brumadinho, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (25/Jan/2019) contaminated the Paraopeba River with mine waste. To identify the adverse effects of this event on public and environmental health, we conducted the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) test (OECD No. 236). During the tests, zebrafish embryos were exposed for 144 hours to solutions containing realistic concentrations of dissolved iron and aluminum and total manganese at the following analysis points upstream or downstream of the dam: 10 km, upstream; 19.7 km, downstream, at the point where water for consumption is collected; 24.5 km, downstream, in the city of Mário Franco; and 59 km, downstream, on the border between the towns of Juatuba and Betim. Metal concentrations were taken from September 2019 report No. 53 released by IGAM. Mortality was high at all exposure points and reached 93% at the Juatuba/Betim point. We also detected lethal, sublethal and teratogenic effects, such as non-hatching, non-inflation of the swim bladder, pericardial edema and scoliosis, affecting up to 25% of embryos at the other analysis points. The results highlight the need for continuous monitoring of the water quality of the Paraopeba River. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Toxicity testing of natural products using the zebrafish model system
AB  - Natural products are recognized for their potential therapeutic properties in treating numerous diseases and disorders. There is a need for rapid assessment for drug discovery application and toxicity of natural products. The zebrafish is a viable vertebrate model that is appropriate for in vivo cell biology experiments and toxicity evaluation. Zebrafish have risen in popularity over the past decades as a preferred biological model to determine chemical toxicity given several strengths. The embryos and larvae are well suited for multiwell plates for high-throughput and high-content imaging analysis and behavioral assays due to their small size and optical transparence for noninvasive visualization of internal organs. In addition, physiological and genetic conservation between zebrafish and other vertebrates permits translation to humans. Zebrafish are thus ideal for drug discovery and toxicity testing of natural products. The aim of this chapter is to summarize imaging methods to recognize phenotypic alterations and behavioral assays that are widely used to assess compounds. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Pidotimod increases inflammation in wounded zebrafish embryos
AB  - Pidotimod (PDT) is a synthetic dipeptide molecule which can improve immune responses in mice and humans, protecting hosts from infection. However, the exact mechanism of protection remains ill-defined. The effect of pidotimod has not yet been investigated in the inflammatory response of zebrafish. In this study, we used tail wound and infection models of zebrafish to study the effect of PDT on inflammation. We found that zebrafish larvae were sensitive to PDT immersion causing toxicity at doses above 50 μg/mL. The tail wound assay showed that PDT increased the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the wound site and promoted the transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il1b. However, we did not observe protection of uropathogenic Escherichia coli or Mycobacterium marinum infected zebrafish larvae following PDT treatment. This study provides a new platform for PDT research, which is worthy of further research to identify further effects of PDT therapy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Alleviation of microcystin-LR-induced hepatic lipidosis and apoptosis in zebrafish by use of rice straw-derived biochar
AB  - Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), mainly released by Microcystis aeruginosa, is posing a tremendous risk to aquatic animals and human health. Meanwhile, biochar (BC) is gradually be used as a sustainable adsorbent to immobilize and remove water pollutants. In our study, we for the first time conducted a full-scale investigation on lipid metabolism and its regulation mechanism of female zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to 0, 10 μg/L MC-LR, 100 μg/L BC, and 10 μg/L MC-LR+ 100 μg/L BC. The results indicated that sub-chronic MC-LR exposure induced hepatic lipidosis and apoptosis, including the formation of lipid droplets, significantly elevation of hepatic triglyceride (TG) level as well as significant upregulated expression of lipogenesis-related genes (foxo1a, elovl5, pparγ) and pro-apoptotic genes (bax, casp3). Nevertheless, no significant alteration was observed in the single BC group and the combined exposure group, which indicated that BC may solely functioned as an absorbent agent to lower MC-LR bioaccumulation in zebrafish liver and alleviate MC-LR-induced hepatotoxicity. Our findings revealed that the utilization of rice straw-derived BC can adsorb and immobile MC-LR in the water, subsequently alleviated the MC-LR-induced hepatic lipidosis and apoptosis in female zebrafish. On the basis of fish health, it is urgent to explore the feasibility of using environmentally friendly materials like BC to adsorb pollutants in water. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Alternative model organisms for toxicological fingerprinting of relevant parameters in food and nutrition
AB  - In the field of (food) toxicology, there is a strong trend of replacing animal trials with alternative methods for the assessment of adverse health effects in humans. The replacement of animal trials is not only driven by ethical concerns but also by the number of potential testing substances (food additives, packaging material, contaminants, and toxicants), which is steadily increasing. In vitro 2D cell culture applications in combination with in silico modeling might provide an applicable first response. However, those systems lack accurate predictions of metabolic actions. Thus, alternative in vivo models could fill the gap between cell culture and animal trials. In this review, we highlight relevant studies in the field and spotlight the applicability of alternative models, including C. elegans, D. rerio, Drosophila, HET-CAM and Lab-on-a-chip. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Non-Clinical Investigation of Tuberculosis Drugs: Conjugated Nor-bornene-Based Nanocarriers Toxic Impacts on Zebrafish
AB  - Introduction: Rifampicin conjugated (R-CP) and rifampicin-isoniazid dual conjugated (RI-CP) norbornene-derived nanocarriers are newly designed for pH stimuli-responsive delivery of tuberculosis (TB) drugs. Its biosafety level is yet to be well established. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the impacts of the nanocarriers on liver cells using the zebra-fish animal model and human liver cell line model (HepG2). Methods: Initially, lethal dose concentration for the norbornene-derived nanocarrier systems in ze-brafish was determined. The toxic effects were analysed at the sub-lethal drug concentration by histopathological study, total GSH level, gene expression, and DNA damage in zebrafish liver cells. Fish erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities were also evaluated. Cell viability and oxidative stress level (ROS generation) after exposure to the nanoconjugates were determined using HepG2 cells in the in vitro study. Results: In vivo studies of both R-CP and RI-CP showed 100% mortality at 96 hours for exposure concentration >100mg/l and showed toxic changes in zebrafish liver histology, GSH, and DNA damage levels. Noticeably upregulated PXR, CYP3A, and cyp2p6 genes were observed in RI-CP exposure than in RIF or R-CP molecules. The in vitro study revealed a dose-dependent effect on cell viability and ROS generation for RIF, R-CP, and RI-CP exposures in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: The current study reports that the rifampicin conjugated (R-CP) and rifampicin-isoni-azid conjugated (RI-CP) norbornene derived nanocarriers exhibit enhanced toxic responses in both adult zebrafish and HepG2 cells. The pH-sensitive norbornene-derived nanocarriers on conjugation with different drugs exhibited varied impacts on hepatic cells. Hence the present investigation rec-ommends a complete metabolomics analysis and norbornene carrier-drug interaction study to be performed for each drug conjugated norbornene nanocarrier to ensure its biosafety. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Degradation of tetracycline over carbon nanosheet: High efficiency, mechanism and biotoxicity assessment
AB  - A new dual-decontamination strategy has been employed to synthesize graphitic carbon nanosheets (GCNs) from Reactive Red 2, a common chemical pollutant in textile wastewater, for efficient tetracycline (TC) degradation via nonradical oxidation processes. Detailed physical characterization indicates that the GCN possesses a layered and flat structure, high microporosity, and microscopic configuration of graphene-like nanosheets with abundant surface O-, N- and S-containing functional groups (including graphitic N and carbonyl groups). From the kinetic model, quenching experiments and mechanism studies, only 1O2 is detected in the GCN/PMS system, without SO4-, HO or O2-. 1O2 contributed to only 17.8% of overall TC degradation. Surface-confined electron transfer appears to be the major oxidation pathway (82.2%) for TC degradation. Furthermore, full-scale biological assays verify that the biotoxicity of the TC degradation products is significantly reduced in comparison with that of the precursor. This work provides a new insight toward the conversion from a chemical pollutant into a metal-free carbon catalyst for wastewater treatment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Xanthatin selectively targets retinoblastoma by inhibiting the PLK1-mediated cell cycle
AB  - PURPOSE. Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in children. Although intra-arterial chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy have become promising therapeutic approaches for advanced intraocular retinoblastoma, the side effects threaten health and are unavoidable, making the development of targeted therapy an urgent need. Therefore, we intended to find a potential drug for human retinoblastoma by screening an in-house compound library that included 89 purified and well-characterized natural products. METHODS. We screened a panel of 89 natural products in retinoblastoma cell lines to find the inhibitor. The inhibition of the identified inhibitor xanthatin on cell growth was detected through half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), flow cytometry assay, and zebrafish model system. RNA-seq further selected the target gene PLK1. RESULTS. We reported the discovery of xanthatin as an effective inhibitor of retinoblastoma. Mechanistically, xanthatin selectively inhibited the proliferation of retinoblastoma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Interestingly, xanthatin targeted PLK1-mediated cell cycle progression. The efficacy of xanthatin was further confirmed in zebrafish models. CONCLUSIONS. Collectively, our data suggested that xanthatin significantly inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, and xanthatin could be a potential drug treatment for retinoblastoma.

TI  - Developmental toxicity and biotransformation of two anti-epileptics in zebrafish embryos and early larvae
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo is gaining interest as a bridging tool between in-vitro and in-vivo developmental toxicity studies. However, cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism in this model is still under debate. Therefore, we investigated the potential of zebrafish embryos and larvae to bioactivate two known anti-epileptics, carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin (PHE), to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (E-CBZ) and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), respectively. First, zebrafish were exposed to CBZ, PHE, E-CBZ and HPPH from 514-to 120-h post fertilization (hpf) and morphologically evaluated. Second, the formations of E-CBZ and HPPH were assessed in culture medium and in whole-embryo extracts at different time points by targeted LC-MS. Finally, E-CBZ and HPPH formation was also assessed in adult zebrafish liver microsomes and compared with those of human, rat, and rabbit. The present study showed teratogenic effects for CBZ and PHE, but not for E-CBZ and HPPH. No HPPH was detected during organogenesis and E-CBZ was only formed at the end of organogenesis. E-CBZ and HPPH formation was also very low-to-negligible in adult zebrafish compared with the mammalian species. As such, other metabolic pathways than those of mammals are involved in the bioactivation of CBZ and PHE, or, these anti-epileptics are teratogens and do not require bioactivation in the zebrafish. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Toxicity of nanoplastics for zebrafish embryos, what we know and where to go next
AB  - Nanoplastics (NP) are an emerging threat to human health and there is a need to understand their toxicity. Zebrafish (ZF) is extensively used as a toxicology model due to its power to com-bine genetic, cellular, and whole organism endpoints. The present review integrates results regarding polystyrene NP effects on ZF embryo development. Study design was evaluated against NP effects. NP size, concentration, and exposure time did not affect organism responses (mortality, development, heart rate, locomotion) or cellular responses (gene expression, enzymes, metabolites). However, NP accumulation depended on size. Smaller NP can reach internal organs (brain, eyes, liver, pancreas, heart) but larger (>200 nm) accumulate mainly in gut, gills and skin. Locomotion and heart rate were commonly affected with hypoactivity and bradycardia being more prevalent. Effects on genetic/enzymatic/metabolic pathways were thoroughly analyzed. Immunity genes were generally upregulated whereas oxidative stress response genes varied. Central nervous system genes and visual related genes were generally downregulated. Results of genetic and enzymatic analyses coincided only for some genes/enzyme pairs. Reviewed studies provide a basis for understanding NP toxicity but results are hard to integrate. We propose key recommendations and future directions with regard to experimental design that may allow greater comparability across future studies. © 2021

TI  - Cyclosporine A Induces Cardiac Developmental Toxicity in Zebrafish by Up-Regulation of Wnt Signaling and Oxidative Stress
AB  - Due to the widely application of Cyclosporine A (CsA) as an immunosuppressant in clinic, it is necessary to study its potential toxicity. Therefore, we used zebrafish as a model animal to evaluate the toxicity of CsA on embryonic development. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to CsA at concentrations of 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 15 mg/L from 12 hpf to 72 hpf resulted in abnormal embryonic development, including cardiac malformation, pericardial edema, decreased heart rate, decreased blood flow velocity, deposition at yolk sac, shortened body length, and increased distance between venous sinus and arterial bulb (SV-BA). The expression of genes related to cardiac development was disordered, and the apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Oxidative stress level was up-regulated and accumulated in pericardium in a dose-dependent manner. Astaxanthin (ATX) treatment could significantly alleviate zebrafish heart defects. CsA induced up-regulation of Wnt signaling in zebrafish, and IWR-1, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling pathway, could effectively rescue the heart defects induced by CsA. Together, our study indicated that CsA induced cardiac developmental toxicity in zebrafish larvae through up-regulating oxidative stress and Wnt signaling, contributing to a more comprehensive evaluation of the safety of the drug.

TI  - Molecular and cellular mechanisms of vascular development in zebrafish
AB  - The establishment of a functional cardiovascular system is crucial for the development of all vertebrates. Defects in the development of the cardiovascular system lead to cardiovascular diseases, which are among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. However, we are just beginning to understand which signaling pathways guide blood vessel growth in different tissues and organs. The advantages of the model organism zebrafish (Danio rerio) helped to identify novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of vascular growth. In this review we will discuss the current knowledge of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the zebrafish embryo. In particular, we describe the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the formation of blood vessels in different vascular beds within the embryo. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Targeting the redox balance pathway using ascorbic acid in sdhb zebrafish mutant larvae
AB  - Patients with mutations in the β-subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB) have the highest risk to develop incurable malignant phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). Therapy development is hindered by limited possibilities to test new therapeutic strategies in vivo. One possible molecular mechanism of SDHB-associated tumorigenesis originates in an overproduc-tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) has already been shown to act as anti-cancer agent in several clinical trials for various types of can-cer. In this study, the potential of the sdhbrmc200 zebrafish model to study SDHB-associated PPGLs using a drug screening approach was investigated. First, we identified increased basal ROS levels in homozygous sdhb larvae compared to heterozygous and wild-type siblings. Using a semi high-throughput drug screening, the effectiveness of different dosages of anti-and pro-oxidant Vitamin C were assessed to evaluate differences in survival, ROS levels, and locomotor activity. Low-dosage levels of Vitamin C induced a decrease of ROS levels but no significant effects on lifespan. In contrast, high-dosage levels of Vitamin C shortened the lifespan of the homozygous sdhbrmc200 larvae while not affecting the lifespan of heterozygous and wild-type siblings. These results validated the sdhbrmc200 zebrafish model as a powerful drug screening tool that may be used to identify novel therapeutic targets for SDHB-associated PPGLs. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Zebrafish and medaka: Important animal models for human neurodegenerative diseases
AB  - Animal models of human neurodegenerative disease have been investigated for several decades. In recent years, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) have become popular in pathogenic and therapeutic studies about human neurodegenerative diseases due to their small size, the optical clarity of embryos, their fast development, and their suitability to large‐scale therapeutic screening. Following the emergence of a new generation of molecular biological technologies such as reverse and forward genetics, morpholino, transgenesis, and gene knockout, many human neurodegenerative disease models, such as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Alzheimer’s, were con-structed in zebrafish and medaka. These studies proved that zebrafish and medaka genes are func-tionally conserved in relation to their human homologues, so they exhibit similar neurodegenerative phenotypes to human beings. Therefore, fish are a suitable model for the investigation of pathologic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and for the large‐scale screening of drugs for potential therapy. In this review, we summarize the studies in modelling human neurodegenerative diseases in zebrafish and medaka in recent years. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Zebrafish Embryo Infection Model to Investigate Pseudomonas aeruginosa Interaction With Innate Immunity and Validate New Therapeutics
AB  - The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a variety of acute infections and is a major cause of mortality in chronically infected patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Considering the intrinsic and acquired resistance of P. aeruginosa to currently used antibiotics, new therapeutic strategies against this pathogen are urgently needed. Whereas virulence factors of P. aeruginosa are well characterized, the interplay between P. aeruginosa and the innate immune response during infection remains unclear. Zebrafish embryo is now firmly established as a potent vertebrate model for the study of infectious human diseases, due to strong similarities of its innate immune system with that of humans and the unprecedented possibilities of non-invasive real-time imaging. This model has been successfully developed to investigate the contribution of bacterial and host factors involved in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, as well as rapidly assess the efficacy of anti-Pseudomonas molecules. Importantly, zebrafish embryo appears as the state-of-the-art model to address in vivo the contribution of innate immunity in the outcome of P. aeruginosa infection. Of interest, is the finding that the zebrafish encodes a CFTR channel closely related to human CFTR, which allowed to develop a model to address P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, innate immune response, and treatment evaluation in a CF context. © Copyright © 2021 Pont and Blanc-Potard.

TI  - Turning waste into wealth: facile and green synthesis of carbon nanodots from pollutants and applications to bioimaging
AB  - In an effort to turn waste into wealth, Reactive Red 2 (RR2), a common and refractory organic pollutant in industrial wastewater, has been employed for the first time as a precursor to synthesize carbon nanodots (CNDs) by a facile, green and low-cost route, without utilization of any strong acids or other oxidizers. The detailed characterizations have confirmed that the synthesized CNDs exhibit good water dispersibility, with a mean particle size of 2.43 nm and thickness of 1-3 layers. Importantly, the excellent fluorescence properties and much reduced biotoxicity of the CNDs confer its potential applications in further biological imaging, which has been successfully verified in bothin vitro(cell culture) andin vivo(zebrafish) model systems. Thus, it is demonstrated that the synthesized CNDs exhibit nice biocompatibility and fluorescence properties for bioimaging. This work not only provides a novel economical and environmentally friendly approach in recycling a chemical pollutant, but also greatly promotes the potential application of CNDs in biological imaging. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

TI  - Systematic Evaluation of the Effects of Toxicant Exposure on Survival in Zebrafish Embryos and Larvae
AB  - The use of whole animal models in toxicological studies is essential for understanding the physiological responses caused by chemical exposures. However, such studies can face reproducibility challenges due to unaccounted experimental parameters that can have a marked influence on toxicological outcomes. Zebrafish embryos and larvae are a popular vertebrate animal model for studying cellular, tissue, and organ responses to toxicant exposures. Despite the popularity of this system, standardized protocols that control for the influence of various experimental parameters and culture conditions on the toxicological response in these animals have not been widely adopted, making it difficult to compare findings from different laboratories. Here, we describe a detailed approach for designing and optimizing protocols to assess the impact of chemical exposures on the development and survival of zebrafish embryos and larvae. We first describe our standard procedure to determine two key toxicological thresholds, the maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) and the lethal concentration (LC50, defined as that in which 50% of larvae die), in response to an exposure that persists from early development through larval maturation. We then describe two protocols to systematically test how key experimental parameters, including genetic background, culture media, animal density, volume, plate material, and developmental stage in which the embryos are exposed, alter the MTC and LC50. Finally, we provide a step-by-step guide to assess the interaction between two chemicals using this model. These protocols will guide the standardization of toxicological studies using zebrafish and maximize reproducibility. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - Less polar compounds and targeted antioxidant potential (In vitro and in vivo) of codium adhaerens c. agardh 1822
AB  - Codium adhaerens from the Adriatic Sea (Croatia) was comprehensively investigated regarding less polar compounds for the first time. Although there are several phytochemical studies on C. adhaerens from other regions, this is the first report on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from fresh (FrCa) and air-dried (DrCa) samples. The novelty is also related to its targeted antioxidant potential in vitro and in vivo. The main aims were to: (a) identify and compare VOCs of FrCa and DrCa obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and hydrodistillation (HD); (b) determine fatty acid (FA) composition of freeze-dried sample (FdCa); (c) determine the composition of less polar fractions of FdCa by high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry with electrospray ionisation (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS); and (d) comprehensively evaluate the antioxidant activity of the fractions by four in vitro assays and in vivo zebrafish model (including embryotoxicity). Significant changes of VOCs were found after air drying. ω6 FAs were present in higher content than ω3 FAs indicating C. adhaerens as a good source of dietary polyunsaturated FAs. The results obtained in vivo correlate well with in vitro methods and both fractions exerted similar antioxidative responses which is in agreement with the high abundance of present biomolecules with known antioxidant properties (e.g., fucoxanthin, pheophytin a, and pheophorbide a). These results suggest that C. adhaerens might be a potent source of natural antioxidants that could be further used in the research of oxidative stress-related diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - A Systematic Review to Compare Chemical Hazard Predictions of the Zebrafish Embryotoxicity Test with Mammalian Prenatal Developmental Toxicity
AB  - Originally developed to inform the acute toxicity of chemicals on fish, the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) has also been proposed for assessing the prenatal developmental toxicity of chemicals, potentially replacing mammalian studies. Although extensively evaluated in primary studies, a comprehensive review summarizing the available evidence for the ZET's capacity is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of how well the presence or absence of exposure-related findings in the ZET predicts prenatal development toxicity in studies with rats and rabbits. A two-Tiered systematic review of the developmental toxicity literature was performed, a review of the ZET literature was followed by one of the mammalian literature. Data were extracted using DistillerSR, and study validity was assessed with an amended SYRCLE's risk-of-bias tool. Extracted data were analyzed for each species and substance, which provided the basis for comparing the 2 test methods. Although limited by the number of 24 included chemicals, our results suggest that the ZET has potential to identify chemicals that are mammalian prenatal developmental toxicants, with a tendency for overprediction. Furthermore, our analysis confirmed the need for further standardization of the ZET. In addition, we identified contextual and methodological challenges in the application of systematic review approaches to toxicological questions. One key to overcoming these challenges is a transition to more comprehensive and transparent planning, conduct and reporting of toxicological studies. The first step toward bringing about this change is to create broad awareness in the toxicological community of the need for and benefits of more evidence-based approaches. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Anti‐genotoxicity evaluation of ellagic acid and curcumin— an in vitro study on zebrafish blood cells
AB  - Genotoxicity is the ability of specific substances to cause DNA damage, affecting development, physiology, and reproduction. This is often mediated by induction of oxidative stress. This in vitro study aims to test the ability of two antioxidants, ellagic acid (EA, 100 μM) and curcumin (Cur, 40 μM) to protect zebrafish blood cells from the genotoxic action of benzene (10 μL/mL). Cells were treated for 30, 60, and 90 min with EA or Cur alone and in combination with benzene. The antigenotoxic role of antioxidants was evaluated in terms of cytotoxicity by trypan blue dye, genome stability by RAPD‐PCR technique, DNA fragmentation and percentage of apoptotic cells using Comet and Diffusion assay, respectively. The results did not show statistical differences in terms of cell viability, genome stability, DNA damage and apoptosis between cells treated with antioxidants. When zebrafish blood cells were co‐incubated with individual antioxidants and benzene, a significant improvement of these parameters was observed in comparison with cells incubated in benzene. Our results suggested that EA and Cur are able to protect zebrafish blood cells against DNA damage and apoptosis caused by mutagenic substance, and laid the foundation for future studies investigating their antigenotoxic potential in DNA oxidative damage therapy. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Phenomics Approach to Investigate Behavioral Toxicity of Environmental or Occupational Toxicants in Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Over the last few years, environmental pollution, especially water pollution, has become a serious issue worldwide. Thus, methods that can help us understand the impact and effects of these pollutants, especially on aquatic animals, are needed. Behavioral assessment has emerged as a crucial tool in toxicology and pharmacology because many studies have shown, in multiple animal models, that various pharmacological compounds can alter behavior, with many of the findings being translatable to humans. Moreover, behavior study can also be used as a suitable indicator in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of pollutants. Several model organisms, especially rodent models, have been extensively employed for behavior studies. However, assessments using this model are generally time consuming, expensive, and require extensive facilities for housing experimental animals. Moreover, behavioral studies typically use different measurements and assessment tools, making comparisons difficult. In addition, even though behavioral phenomics has the potential to comprehensively illustrate the toxicities of chemicals, there is only a limited number of studies focusing on animal behavior using such a global approach. Here, we describe a phenomics approach that can be used to investigate the impact of pollutants using zebrafish. The approach consists of several behavioral tests, including response to a novel environment, mirror-reflection image, predator fish, and conspecifics, after exposure to a test chemical. Phenotype fingerprinting, a method for summarizing individual phenotypes based on the results of the behavioral tests, is then conducted to reduce data complexity and display the pattern of each compound on behavioral phenotypes in zebrafish. This approach may be useful to researchers studying the potential adverse effects of different pollutants. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol 1: Novel tank test.

TI  - Changes in digestive enzyme activities during the early ontogeny of the South American cichlid (Cichlasoma dimerus)
AB  - Cichlasoma dimerus is a neotropical cichlid that has been used as a biological model for neuroendocrinology studies. However, its culture is problematic in terms of larval feeding to allow having enough fry quantity and quality. Larviculture requires full knowledge about the digestive system and nutrition; therefore, this study was intended to assess the digestive enzymes' changes at different ages during the early ontogeny. Acid protease activity was detectable from the first day after hatching (dah), increasing to its maximum peaks on 9 dah. In contrast, alkaline proteases had low activity in the first days of life but reached their maximum activity on 17 dah. Chymotrypsin, L-aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase A activities increased at 6 dah, while trypsin activity was first detected on 13 dah and reached its maximum activity on 17 dah. Lipase and α-amylase activity were detectable at low levels in the first days of life, but the activity fluctuated and reaching its maximum activity at 21 dah. Alkaline phosphatase continued to oscillate and had two maximum activity peaks, the first at 6 dah and the second at 19 dah. Zymograms of alkaline proteases on day 6 dah six revealed four activity bands with molecular weights from 16.1 to 77.7 kDa. On 13 dah, two more activity bands of 24.4 and 121.9 kDa were detected, having a total of six proteases. The enzymatic activity analyzes indicate the digestive system shows the low activity of some enzymes in the first days after hatching, registering significant increases on 6 dah and the maximum peaks of activities around at 17 dah. Therefore, we recommend replacing live food with dry feed and only providing dry feed after day 17 dah. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Zebrafish as a model for anticancer nanomedicine studies
AB  - Nanomedicine is a new approach to fight against cancer by the development of anticancer nanoparticles (NPs) that are of high sensitivity, specificity, and targeting ability to detect cancer cells, such as the ability of Silica NPs in targeting epithelial cancer cells. However, these anticancer NPs require preclinical testing, and zebrafish is a useful animal model for preclinical studies of anticancer NPs. This model affords a large sample size, optical imaging, and easy genetic manipulation that aid in nanomedicine studies.

TI  - Paternal exposure to excessive methionine altered behavior and neurochemical activities in zebrafish offspring
AB  - An increase in plasma l-methionine (Met) levels, even if transitory, can cause important toxicological alterations in the affected individuals. Met is essential in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms and its influence on the subsequent generation has been investigated. However, few studies have explored the influence of a temporary increase in Met levels in parents on their offspring. This study evaluated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of parental exposure to high Met concentration (3 mM) in zebrafish offspring. Adult zebrafish were exposed to Met for 7 days, maintained for additional 7 days in tanks that contained only water, and then used for breeding. The offspring obtained from these fish (F1) were tested in this study. During the early stages of offspring development, morphology, heart rate, survival, locomotion, and anxiety-like behavior were assessed. When these animals reached the adult stage, locomotion, anxiety, aggression, social interaction, memory, oxidative stress, and levels of amino acids and neurotransmitters were analyzed. F1 larvae Met group presented an increase in the distance and mean speed when compared to the control group. F1 adult Met group showed decreased anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. An increase in reactive oxygen species was also observed in the F1 adult Met group whereas lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes did not change when compared to the control group. Dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and glutathione levels were increased in the F1 adult Met group. Taken together, our data show that even a transient increase in Met in parents can cause behavioral and neurochemical changes in the offspring, promoting transgenerational effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Reversing the systemic biotoxicity of nanomaterials by downregulating ROS-related signaling pathways in the multi-organs of Zebrafish embryos
AB  - Nanomaterials have broad application prospects in human health and diseases, including medical imaging and drug delivery and treatment. With the gradual advent of the nano era, the safety of nanomaterials in biology and the environment must be evaluated more widely and deeply. Herein, we scanned some widely used biomedical nanomaterials toxicity with an in vivo zebrafish model and demonstrated that cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) were the most toxic. Embryos exposed to CdSe QDs showed the activation of NADPH oxidase nox4 and an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The expression of antioxidant defense enzyme superoxide dismutase sod1 and glutathione peroxidase gpx1 increased the response to oxidative stress. Further, excessive ROS activated apoptosis by the p53- and caspase-3-mediated signaling pathway. Several modification methods, including silica coating, core-shell structure development, and organic molecular camouflage were applied to reduce the toxicity of the materials, whereby the polyethylene glycol (PEG) camouflage method exhibited better performance for improving the biocompatibility of CdSe QDs, which could effectively reduce ROS and apoptosis induced by CdSe QDs in the zebrafish model. Meanwhile, we employed a series of genetically modified zebrafish models to assess the CdSe QDs toxicity, and the polyethylene glycol (PEG) camouflage showed protective effects in the heart, nerves, blood vessels, and immune system. CdSe QDs disguised by PEG could effectively alleviate the toxicity of CdSe QDs in multiple organs. In summary, our data revealed that CdSe QDs induced an excessive production of ROS, which would activate the apoptosis pathway mediated by p53 and caspase-3 and resulted in cardiovascular system, nervous system, and immune system toxicity. PEG camouflage could effectively decrease ROS generation and apoptosis to improve the biocompatibility of CdSe QDs. This journal is © 2021 the Partner Organisations.

TI  - A Dietary Cholesterol-Based Intestinal Inflammation Assay for Improving Drug-Discovery on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with chronic infiltration of immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract are common and largely incurable. The therapeutic targeting of IBD has been hampered by the complex causality of the disease, with environmental insults like cholesterol-enriched Western diets playing a critical role. To address this drug development challenge, we report an easy-to-handle dietary cholesterol-based in vivo assay that allows the screening of immune-modulatory therapeutics in transgenic zebrafish models. An improvement in the feeding strategy with high cholesterol diet (HCD) selectively induces a robust and consistent infiltration of myeloid cells in larvae intestines that is highly suitable for compound discovery efforts. Using transgenics with fluorescent reporter expression in neutrophils, we take advantage of the unique zebrafish larvae clarity to monitor an acute inflammatory response in a whole organism context with a fully functional innate immune system. The use of semi-automated image acquisition and processing combined with quantitative image analysis allows categorizing anti- or pro-inflammatory compounds based on a leukocytic inflammation index. Our HCD gut inflammation (HCD-GI) assay is simple, cost- and time-effective as well as highly physiological which makes it unique when compared to chemical-based zebrafish models of IBD. Besides, diet is a highly controlled, selective and targeted trigger of intestinal inflammation that avoids extra-intestinal outcomes and reduces the chances of chemical-induced toxicity during screenings. We show the validity of this assay for a screening platform by testing two dietary phenolic acids, namely gallic acid (GA; 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) and ferulic acid (FA; 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid), with well described anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of IBD. Analysis of common IBD therapeutics (Prednisolone and Mesalamine) proved the fidelity of our IBD-like intestinal inflammation model. In conclusion, the HCD-GI assay can facilitate and accelerate drug discovery efforts on IBD, by identification of novel lead molecules with immune modulatory action on intestinal neutrophilic inflammation. This will serve as a jumping-off point for more profound analyses of drug mechanisms and pathways involved in early IBD immune responses. © Copyright © 2021 Silva, Carregosa, Gonçalves, Vieira, Nunes dos Santos, Jacinto and Crespo.

TI  - Large-scale phenotypic drug screen identifies neuroprotectants in zebrafish and mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa
AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and associated inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are caused by rod photoreceptor degeneration, necessitating therapeutics promoting rod photoreceptor survival. To address this, we tested compounds for neuroprotective effects in multiple zebrafish and mouse RP models, reasoning drugs effective across species and/or independent of disease mutation may translate better clinically. We first performed a large-scale phenotypic drug screen for compounds promoting rod cell survival in a larval zebrafish model of inducible RP. We tested 2,934 compounds, mostly human-approved drugs, across six concentrations, resulting in 113 compounds being identified as hits. Secondary tests of 42 high-priority hits confirmed eleven lead candidates. Leads were then evaluated in a series of mouse RP models in an effort to identify compounds effective across species and RP models, i.e., potential pan-disease therapeutics. Nine of eleven leads exhibited neuroprotective effects in mouse primary photoreceptor cultures, and three promoted photoreceptor survival in mouse rd1 retinal explants. Both shared and complementary mechanisms of action were implicated across leads. Shared target tests implicated parp1-dependent cell death in our zebrafish RP model. Complementation tests revealed enhanced and additive/synergistic neuroprotective effects of paired drug combinations in mouse photoreceptor cultures and zebrafish, respectively. These results highlight the value of cross-species/multi-model phenotypic drug discovery and suggest combinatorial drug therapies may provide enhanced therapeutic benefits for RP patients. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

TI  - Loss of Pde6a Induces Rod Outer Segment Shrinkage and Visual Alterations in pde6aQ70X Mutant Zebrafish, a Relevant Model of Retinal Dystrophy
AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common forms of inherited retinal degeneration with 1/4,000 people being affected. The vision alteration primarily begins with rod photoreceptor degeneration, then the degenerative process continues with cone photoreceptor death. Variants in 71 genes have been linked to RP. One of these genes, PDE6a is responsible for RP43. To date no treatment is available and patients suffer from pronounced visual impairment in early childhood. We used the novel zebrafish pde6aQ70X mutant, generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea at the European Zebrafish Resource Centre, to better understand how PDE6a loss of function leads to photoreceptor alteration. Interestingly, zebrafish pde6aQ70X mutants exhibited impaired visual function at 5 dpf as evidenced by the decrease in their visual motor response (VMR) compared to pde6aWT larvae. This impaired visual function progressed with time and was more severe at 21 dpf. These modifications were associated with an alteration of rod outer segment length at 5 and 21 dpf. In summary, these findings suggest that rod outer segment shrinkage due to Pde6a deficiency begins very early in zebrafish, progresses with time. The zebrafish pde6aQ70X mutant represents an ideal model of RP to screen relevant active small molecules that will block the progression of the disease. © Copyright © 2021 Crouzier, Diez, Richard, Cubedo, Barbereau, Rossel, Delaunay, Maurice and Delprat.

TI  - Discovery of a Potent Conorfamide fromConus episcopatus Using a Novel Zebrafish Larvae Assay
AB  - Natural products such as conotoxins have tremendous potential as tools for biomedical research and for the treatment of different human diseases. Conotoxins are peptides present in the venoms of predatory cone snails that have a rich diversity of pharmacological functions. One of the major bottlenecks in natural products research is the rapid identification and evaluation of bioactive molecules. To overcome this limitation, we designed a set of light-induced behavioral assays in zebrafish larvae to screen for bioactive conotoxins. We used this screening approach to test several unique conotoxins derived from different cone snail clades and discovered that a conorfamide fromConus episcopatus, CNF-Ep1, had the most dramatic alterations in the locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. Interestingly, CNF-Ep1 is also bioactive in several mouse assay systems when testedin vitroandin vivo. Our novel screening platform can thus accelerate the identification of bioactive marine natural products, and the first compound discovered using this assay has intriguing properties that may uncover novel neuronal circuitry. © 2021 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

TI  - Brain-Body Control of Glucose Homeostasis—Insights From Model Organisms
AB  - Tight regulation of blood glucose is essential for long term health. Blood glucose levels are defended by the correct function of, and communication between, internal organs including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and brain. Critically, the brain is sensitive to acute changes in blood glucose level and can modulate peripheral processes to defend against these deviations. In this mini-review we highlight select key findings showcasing the utility, strengths, and limitations of model organisms to study brain-body interactions that sense and control blood glucose levels. First, we discuss the large platform of genetic tools available to investigators studying mice and how this field may yet reveal new modes of communication between peripheral organs and the brain. Second, we discuss how rats, by virtue of their size, have unique advantages for the study of CNS control of glucose homeostasis and note that they may more closely model some aspects of human (patho)physiology. Third, we discuss the nascent field of studying the CNS control of blood glucose in the zebrafish which permits ease of genetic modification, large-scale measurements of neural activity and live imaging in addition to high-throughput screening. Finally, we briefly discuss glucose homeostasis in drosophila, which have a distinct physiology and glucoregulatory systems to vertebrates. © Copyright © 2021 MacDonald, Yang, Cruz, Beall and Ellacott.

TI  - On the effects of iron ore tailings micro/nanoparticles in embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Iron ore tailings (IOT) represent a major problem in the mining industry worldwide due to large volumes of waste disposed in mine sites. IOT are exposed to the environment and subjected to wind and water dispersion, even under non-catastrophic scenarios as dam collapses, and the effects of these particles to the biota are still mostly unknown. This work aimed to prepare and to characterize a suspension containing the finest (micro/nano range) particles of IOT and to evaluate its effects on development and behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio), at both embryonic and larval stages. IOT suspension comprised 37 mg L−1 of a multi-mineral material mainly composed by hematite and quartz, in a size-range of 33–1400 nm. Regarding in vivo toxicological assays, no robust alterations were recorded in functional, morphological and behavioral end-points analyzed, although a significant adhesion of IOT particles on zebrafish chorion was observed, without a prejudice of embryo hatching. Under applied conditions, iron ore particles did not present harmful effects to the initial stages of zebrafish development, and the particle size range and potential interactions with SiO2 content might be behind such effect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Development of a zebrafish screening model for diabetic retinopathy induced by hyperglycemia: Reproducibility verification in animal model
AB  - This study aimed at creating a zebrafish screening model for diabetic retinopathy, and evaluated the effects of aflibercept, which is being used to treated diabetic retinopathy. A morphological change occurred at 160 mM of glucose. The survival and hatching rate decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In the 130 mM glucose group, the retinal vessel diameter was more than double that in the normal group. The zebrafish embryo morphology changed in 200 μg/mL and 400 μg/mL at aflibercept. The survival and hatching rate decrease at 400 μg/mL. Aflibercept 100 μg/mL was a nontoxic and effective dose for the zebrafish diabetic retinopathy model. The expression of diabetic retinopathy inflammatory markers was increased in hyperglycemia. But the inflammation was improved by aflibercept in the zebrafish eye. In a zebrafish diabetic retinopathy model, the diameters of retinal vessels were reduced after treatment with aflibercept, and molecular biological and histopathological efficacy was confirmed. This model can serve for screening of new drug candidates for treatment of in diabetic retinopathy. © 2020

TI  - Short-term exposure to the simple polyphenolic compound gallic acid induces neuronal hyperactivity in zebrafish larvae
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that the biological effects of polyphenols are not restricted to antioxidant activity, but they exert a wide range of modulatory effects on metabolic pathways, cellular signaling and gene expression. In this study, we tested the minimum safe concentration of gallic acid (GA) in 72 hpf zebrafish larvae in order to evaluate the effects on the central nervous system and the behavioral response. We showed that a short exposure (30 min) induces the depletion of the two main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, Glu and GABA, respectively, in the larval nervous system. The acute impairment of GABAergic-glutamatergic balance was paralleled by an increase of the fosab neuronal activity marker in specific brain areas, such as the forebrain, olfactory bulbs, pallial area, ventral midbrain, tegmentum, and the medulla oblongata ventral area. The neuronal excitation was mirrored by the increased cumulative motor response. The inhibition of the olfactory epithelium with brief cadmium exposition suggests a direct involvement of olfaction in the larvae response to GA. Our results demonstrate that a brief exposure to GA induces motoneuronal hyperexcitability in zebrafish. The behavioral response was probably elicited through the activation of an odorous, or chemical, stimulus. The specificity of the activated neuronal territories suggests the involvement of additional signaling pathways. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated, our data support the hypothesis that GA acts as an excitatory molecule, capable of inducing a specific nerve response. These results offer a new vision on potential effects of GA. © 2020 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Reproductive toxicity of Roundup WG® herbicide: impairments in ovarian follicles of model organism Danio rerio
AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used in global agriculture, and their effects on different non-target animal organisms have been the focus of many toxicological studies. Regarding the potential role of glyphosate-based herbicides as an endocrine disruptor, the present study aims to investigate the effects of the herbicide Roundup WG® (RWG) on female reproduction, specifically on the ovarian maturation of Danio rerio. Adult females were exposed to low concentrations of RWG (0.065, 0.65, and 6.5 mg L−1) for 15 days, and then the ovaries were submitted to structural and morphometric procedures, accompanied by analysis of the vitellin protein content. Our results showed an increase of initial ovarian follicle numbers, decrease of late ovarian follicles, and smaller diameter of ovarian follicles in fish exposed to 0.065 and 6.5 mg L−1. The thickness of vitelline envelope was reduced, and the vitellin protein content was increased in the ovarian follicle in the two highest concentrations. Ultrastructural changes in the ovarian follicular component were evident and expressed by the cell index; vacuolization in follicular cells, increase of perivitelline space, and impaired mitochondria in oocytes were observed. Therefore, RWG adversely affects the ovarian maturation in D. rerio, and these changes can lead to reproductive toxicity, compromising population dynamics. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - A nontoxic fungal natural product modulates fin regeneration in zebrafish larvae upstream of FGF-WNT developmental signaling
AB  - Background: The regeneration of larvae zebrafish fin emerged as a new model of regeneration in the last decade. In contrast to genetic tools to study fin regeneration, chemical probes to modulate and interrogate regeneration processes are not well developed. Results: We set up a zebrafish larvae fin regeneration assay system and tested activities of natural product compounds and extracts, prepared from various microbes. Colomitide C, a recently isolated product from a fungus obtained from Antarctica, inhibited larvae fin regeneration. Using fluorescent reporter transgenic lines, we show that colomitide C inhibited fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and WNT/β-catenin signaling, which were activated after larvae fin amputation. By using the endothelial cell reporter line and immunofluorescence, we showed that colomitide C did not affect migration of the blood vessel and nerve into the injured larvae fin. Colomitide C did not show any cytotoxic activities when tested against FGF receptor-amplified human cancer cell lines. Conclusion: Colomitide C, a natural product, modulated larvae fin regeneration likely acting upstream of FGF and WNT signaling. Colomitide C may serve as a template for developing new chemical probes to study regeneration and other biological processes. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

TI  - Zebrafish: A Model Organism for Studying Enteric Nervous System Development and Disease
AB  - The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is a large network of enteric neurons and glia that regulates various processes in the gastrointestinal tract including motility, local blood flow, mucosal transport and secretion. The ENS is derived from stem cells coming from the neural crest that migrate into and along the primitive gut. Defects in ENS establishment cause enteric neuropathies, including Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), which is characterized by an absence of enteric neural crest cells in the distal part of the colon. In this review, we discuss the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the development of the ENS. The accessibility of the rapidly developing gut in zebrafish embryos and larvae, enables in vivo visualization of ENS development, peristalsis and gut transit. These properties make the zebrafish a highly suitable model to bring new insights into ENS development, as well as in HSCR pathogenesis. Zebrafish have already proven fruitful in studying ENS functionality and in the validation of novel HSCR risk genes. With the rapid advancements in gene editing techniques and their unique properties, research using zebrafish as a disease model, will further increase our understanding on the genetics underlying HSCR, as well as possible treatment options for this disease. © Copyright © 2021 Kuil, Chauhan, Cheng, Hofstra and Alves.

TI  - Study on liver diseases with zebrafish as an important tool [斑马鱼作为一种重要的工具进行肝脏疾病研究]
AB  - With the increasing incidence of hepatobiliary diseases, it is particularly important to understand the role of molecular, cellular and physiological factors in the clinical diagnosis and treatment with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the development of liver disease. Appropriate animal models can help us identify the possible mechanisms of relevant diseases. Danio rerio (zebrafish) model was traditionally used to study embryonic development, and has been gradually used in screening and evaluation of liver diseases and relevant drug in recent years. Zebrafish embryos develop rapidly and the digestive organs of 5-day-old juvenile fish are all mature. At this stage, they may develop hepatobiliary diseases induced by developmental defects or compounds. Zebrafish liver is similar to human liver in cell composition, function, signal transduction, response to injury and cell process mediating liver disease. Furthermore, due to the high conservation of genes and proteins between humans and zebrafish, zebrafish becomes an alternative system for studying basic mechanisms of liver disease. Therefore, genetic screening could be performed to identify new genes involving specific disease processes, and chemical screening could be made for drugs in specific processes. This paper briefly introduced the experimental properties of zebrafish as model system, emphasized the study progress of zebrafish models for pathological mechanism of liver diseases, especially fatty liver, and drug screening and evaluation, so as to provide ideas and techniques for the future liver toxicity assessment of TCM. © 2021, Editorial Board of China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica.

TI  - Effective identification of toxic related components of Psoraleae Fructus based on zebrafish model [基于斑马鱼模型的补骨脂毒性相关成分群的高效辨识研究]
AB  - Objective: To efficiently identify the toxic component groups of Psoraleae Fructus (PF) based on zebrafish model combined with correlation analysis. Methods: Contents of four coumarins, four flavonoids and bakuchiol in 18 batches of PF from seven producing areas were determined by HPLC. Zebrafish model was used to evaluate the toxicity of 18 batches of PF decoction, with mortality, organ poisoning form, and LC50 value of zebrafish (6 dpf) as indicators. Correlation analysis between contents of various components and LC50 value of zebrafish (6 dpf) were carried out to identify toxicity related components, and the zebrafish toxicity evaluation results of the representative components were verified. Results: Contents of coumarins, flavonoids and bakuchiol in 18 batches of PF decoction from different producing areas were quite different. The maximum content of four coumarins, flavonoid (neobavaisoflavone) and bakuchiol were respectively 3.47-5.60, 5.30 and 6.47 times of the minimum. The zebrafish toxicity evaluation results showed that the toxicity of 18 batches of PF decoction was quite different, and LC50 (6 dpf) of the maximum was 7.2 times of the minimum. The results of correlation analysis between toxicity and component content showed that zebrafish toxicity had a good correlation with flavonoids and bakuchiol (R2 were respectively 0.623 4 and 0.587 8), while the correlation with coumarins was relatively low (R2 was 0.187 7). Toxicity evaluation results of various representative components showed that bakuchiol and three flavonoids (bavachin, neobavaisoflavone, isobavachalcone) were the key toxic components of PF, while coumarins was relatively safe. Conclusion: Zebrafish model could efficiently and sensitively reflect toxicity differences of different batches of PF, of which toxicity relevant component groups could be efficiently identified through correlation analysis between toxicity and content of components, providing a reference for quickly discovering toxicity and related substances from the complex system of traditional Chinese medicine. © 2021, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

TI  - Relative developmental toxicities of reclaimed water to zebrafish embryos and the relationship with relevant water quality parameters
AB  - Reclaimed water recharging rivers is an important way to solve the problem of water shortage. However, reclaimed water contains some toxic contaminants, which will cause ecological and health risks. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between developmental toxicities and relevant water quality parameters. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to secondary effluent, wastewater with advanced treatment (Tertiary treatment effluent) and blank (Aerated tap water). The samples taken in April showed higher biological toxicity to embryos, as the maximum value of mortality and malformation reached to 47.5 % for secondary effluent, 75 % for wastewater with advance treatment, while the blank was just 2 % at 120 hours post fertilization. The tested samples also showed significantly adverse effect on hatchability of zebrafish. The hatching rates of embryos exposed to secondary effluent and tertiary treatment effluent were much lower than blank. And significant delay in hatching time existed during the hatching period. The advanced treatment did not show beneficial effects for reducing acute toxicity. The main factor resulted in hatching inhibition may be ammonia especially the free ammonia, as it showed highest coefficient with hatching rate. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) of ammonia for mortality and malformation were 5 ​mg/L and 10 ​mg/L respectively. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of ammonia for body length and hatchability were both 2 ​mg/L, while the concentration of free ammonia was 0.19 ​mg/L. Considering the biological toxicity of ammonia on aquatic organism, the discharge concentration of ammonia is advised to be controlled below 2 ​mg/L. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Studying the Tumor Microenvironment in Zebrafish
AB  - The tumor microenvironment significantly contributes to tumor initiation, progression, neo-angiogenesis, and metastasis, and a better understanding of the role of the different cellular players would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Towards this goal, intravital imaging is a powerful method to unravel interaction partners of tumor cells. Among vertebrate model organisms, zebrafish is uniquely suited for in vivo imaging studies. In recent years zebrafish has also become a valuable model in cancer research. In this chapter, we will summarize, how zebrafish has been used to characterize cells of the tumor microenvironment. We will cover both genetically engineered cancer models and xenograft models in zebrafish. The majority of work has been done on the role of innate immune cells and their role during tumor initiation and metastasis, but we will also cover studies focusing on adipocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Taken together, we will highlight the versatile use of the zebrafish model for in vivo tumor microenvironment studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Assessment of Larval Zebrafish Locomotor Activity for Developmental Neurotoxicity Screening
AB  - Animal behavior has long been recognized as an informative endpoint for assessing effects of chemicals on the developing nervous system. Previous laboratory animal tests to screen and prioritize chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity have not met growing risk assessment demands, necessitating higher throughput testing strategies. Zebrafish, a small freshwater vertebrate species, have been proposed as one alternative vertebrate model. Here, we describe methodology for rapid screening of chemical libraries for developmental neurotoxicity potential utilizing larval zebrafish locomotor activity as an endpoint. The goal of this chapter is to provide guidance for applying this approach, as well as to provide a discussion of the advantages and limitations of various aspects of this method. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Zebrafish Models of Nanotoxicity: A Comprehensive Account
AB  - Nanomaterials are increasingly employed in a wide variety of applications, ranging from electronics to nanomedicine. However, not much is known on the impact that nanomaterials could have on human health and environment. Thereby, to fill this gap of knowledge, in the last decade, toxicity studies were strongly promoted by the scientific community. In this framework, zebrafish (Danio rerio) represent emerging and powerful models systems for high-throughput in vivo toxicity screening. These vertebrates present unique properties, including small size, high genetic homology to mammals, and optical transparency. This book chapter presents an overview of these models, in terms of exceptional peculiarities, and of the different types of parameters that can be assessed to investigate the potential toxic effects of nanomaterials at multiple levels. In addition, it highlights the toxicity screening of several classes of nanomaterials, including carbon-based nanomaterials, metallic nanoparticles, and semiconductor nanomaterials. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - A novel infection protocol in zebrafish embryo to assess Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and validate efficacy of a quorum sensing inhibitor in vivo
AB  - The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a variety of acute infections and is a major cause of mortality in chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients. Due to increased resistance to antibiotics, new therapeutic strategies against P. aeruginosa are urgently needed. In this context, we aimed to develop a simple vertebrate animal model to rapidly assess in vivo drug efficacy against P. aeruginosa. Zebrafish are increasingly considered for modeling human infections caused by bacterial pathogens, which are commonly microinjected in embryos. In the present study, we established a novel protocol for zebrafish infection by P. aeruginosa based on bath immersion in 96-well plates of tail-injured embryos. The immersion method, followed by a 48-hour survey of embryo viability, was first validated to assess the virulence of P. aeruginosa wild-type PAO1 and a known attenuated mutant. We then validated its relevance for antipseudomonal drug testing by first using a clinically used antibiotic, ciprofloxacin. Secondly, we used a novel quorum sensing (QS) inhibitory molecule, N-(2-pyrimidyl)butanamide (C11), the activity of which had been validated in vitro but not previously tested in any animal model. A significant protective effect of C11 was observed on infected embryos, supporting the ability of C11 to attenuate in vivo P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. In conclusion, we present here a new and reliable method to compare the virulence of P. aeruginosa strains in vivo and to rapidly assess the efficacy of clinically relevant drugs against P. aeruginosa, including new antivirulence compounds. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Thermal Proteome Profiling in Zebrafish Reveals Effects of Napabucasin on Retinoic Acid Metabolism
AB  - Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) allows for the unbiased detection of drug–target protein engagements in vivo. Traditionally, 1 cell type is used for TPP studies, with the risk of missing important differentially expressed target proteins. The use of whole organisms would circumvent this problem. Zebrafish embryos are amenable to such an approach. Here, we used TPP on whole zebrafish embryo lysate to identify protein targets of napabucasin, a compound that may affect signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling through an ill-understood mechanism. In zebrafish embryos, napabucasin induced developmental defects consistent with inhibition of Stat3 signaling. TPP profiling showed no distinct shift in Stat3 upon napabucasin treatment, but effects were detected on the oxidoreductase, Pora, which might explain effects on Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, thermal stability of several aldehyde dehydrogenases was affected. Moreover, napabucasin activated aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymatic activity in vitro. Aldehyde dehydrogenases have crucial roles in retinoic acid metabolism, and functionally, we validated napabucasin-mediated activation of the retinoic acid pathway in zebrafish in vivo. We conclude that TPP profiling in whole zebrafish embryo lysate is feasible and facilitates direct correlation of in vivo effects of small molecule drugs with their protein targets. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Chemical Genetics: Manipulating the Germline with Small Molecules
AB  - Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the precursor cells that form during early embryogenesis and later differentiate into oocytes or spermatozoa. Abnormal development of PGCs is frequently a causative factor of infertility and germ cell tumors. However, our understanding of PGC development remains insufficient, and we have few pharmacological tools for manipulating PGC development for biological study or therapy. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos provide an excellent in vivo animal model to study PGCs, because zebrafish embryos are transparent and develop outside the mother. Importantly, the model is also amenable to facile chemical manipulations, including scalable screening to discover novel compounds that alter PGC development. This chapter describes methodologies for manipulating the germline (i.e., PGCs) with small molecules and for monitoring PGC development. Utilizing the 3′UTR of PGC marker genes such as nanos3 and ddx4/vasa is a key component of these methodologies, which consist of expressing fluorescent or luminescent proteins in PGCs, treatment with small molecules, and quantitative observation of PGC development. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

TI  - Effects of acute triclosan exposure on gill and liver tissues of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent found in personal care, household, veterinary, medical, and industrial products. TCS has been detected in soil, sediment, and surface water. In the current work, the effects of acute exposure to TCS on gill and liver tissues of zebrafish were evaluated. Adult zebrafish were treated with sublethal concentrations of TCS (34, 85, and 170 μg/L) for 120 h. Gill and liver samples were removed and embedded in paraffin for histopathological investigations. TCS induced aneurysm, capillary dilation, lamellar disorganization, hyperplasia, epithelial lifting, and desquamation in the gills. Liver specimens showed sinusoidal dilation, congestion, vacuolization, hepatocellular degeneration, and necrosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to observe the apoptotic effect of TCS. Accordingly, no apoptotic cells were detected in the specimens of 34 μg/L of TCS exposed gills, while the slides of 85 and 170 μg/L of TCS treated gills showed a high number of TUNEL-positive cells. In the liver, no TUNEL-positive cells were identified in 34 μg/L of TCS treated samples of zebrafish. 85 and 170 μg/L of TCS exposed livers showed few hepatic parenchymal cells undergoing apoptosis. © EDP Sciences, 2021.

TI  - Response of human glioblastoma cells to vitamin B12 deficiency: A study using the non-toxic cobalamin antagonist
AB  - The most important biological function of vitamin B12 is to accomplish DNA synthesis, which is necessary for cell division. Cobalamin deficiency may be especially acute for rapidly divid-ing cells, such as glioblastoma cells. Therefore, cobalamin antagonists offer a medicinal potential for developing anti-glioma agents. In the present study, we developed an in vitro model of cobalamin deficiency in glioblastoma cells. Long-term treatment of cells with the cobalamin analogue, hydroxycobalamin [c-lactam] (HCCL) was applied to induce an increase of hypocobalaminemia biomarker. Cytometric assays demonstrated that vitamin B12 promoted glioblastoma cells proliferation, whereas the treatment of cells with HCCL caused a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation and an induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Vitamin B12 counteracted all the observed effects of HCCL. In the in silico study, we characterized the molecular interactions between HCCL and transcobalamin II (TCII). We have demonstrated that HCCL shares similar interactions with TCII as naturally occurring cobalamins and therefore may act as a competitive inhibitor of this key transporter protein. We assessed the impact of HCCL on the mortality or developmental malformations of zebrafish em-bryos. Collectively, our findings suggest that the use of cobalamin transport antagonists as potential anti-glioma agents would be worth exploring further. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Using Zebrafish Larvae as a Xenotransplantation Model to Study Ewing Sarcoma
AB  - Tumor models allowing for the in vivo investigation of molecular mechanisms driving tumor progression and metastasis are important to develop novel strategies for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, for Ewing sarcoma no adequate genetic animal models are currently available. Mouse xenograft models are the state of the art to model Ewing sarcoma in vivo. Here, we describe an alternative Ewing sarcoma xenograft model in embryonic and larval zebrafish. This xenograft model offers live imaging and easy compound testing opportunities hereby complementing mouse xenograft models. In this chapter, we provide a detailed protocol how to xenograft Ewing sarcoma cells (shSK-E17T) into 2-day-old zebrafish and how xenografted zebrafish can be imaged and analyzed over consecutive days to study tumor proliferation. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Early preclinical screening using zebrafish (Danio rerio) reveals the safety of the candidate anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent TnP
AB  - The patented anti-inflammatory peptide TnP had its effectiveness recently confirmed in vivo in a murine model of multiple sclerosis and asthma. In this work, the safety of the TnP was evaluated in investigative toxicology tests using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. We conducted the OECD #236 test to investigate effects of the TnP on the survival, hatching performance, and morphological formation of zebrafish embryos. After determining these endpoints, morphometric analysis termination of locomotion eartbeat rate in zebrafish larvae were evaluated to identify adverse effects such as neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. The results highlight a wide therapeutic index for TnP with non-lethal and safe doses rom 1 nM to 10 μM, without causing neurotoxicity or cardiotoxic effect. The low frequencyf abnormalities by TnP was associated with high safety of the molecule and the developing embryo's ability to process and eliminate it. TnP crossed the blood-brain barrier without disturbing the normal architecture of forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Our data reinforce the importance of zebrafish as an accurate investigative toxicology model to assess acute toxicity as well as cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity of molecules in the preclinical phase of development. © 2020

TI  - Comparison of zebrafish in vitro and in vivo developmental toxicity assessments of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs)
AB  - Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are persistent environmental contaminants that are associated with various adverse health outcomes. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is one of the most prominently detected PFAAs in the environment, which is now replaced with shorter chain carbon compounds including perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA). The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of four PFAAs as a function of chain length and head group (carboxylate versus sulfonate) with in vitro and in vivo zebrafish assessments, which were subsequently compared to other cell and aquatic models. Mortality rate increased with chain length (PFOA > PFHxA ≫ PFBA) in both whole embryo/larvae and embryonic cell models. The sulfonate group enhanced toxicity with perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) showing higher toxicity than PFBA and PFHxA in both larvae and cells. Toxicity trends were similar among different aquatic models, but sensitivities varied. Discrepancies with other zebrafish studies were confirmed to be associated with a lack of neutralization of acidic pH of dosing solutions in these other investigations, demonstrating the need for rigor in reporting pH of exposure solutions in all experiments. The zebrafish embryonic cell line was also found to be similar to most other cell lines regardless of exposure length. Overall, results agree with findings in other cell lines and organisms where longer chain length and sulfonate group increase toxicity, except in investigations not neutralizing the exposure solutions for these acidic compounds. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Safety Evaluation of Coumarins of Psoralea corylifolia L. and Their Glycosides by Toxicity-Metabolism Correlation Analysis Using Zebrafish [斑马鱼毒性-代谢关联分析法评价补骨脂香豆素及其糖苷成分安全性]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of coumarins from Psoralea corylifolia L. and their glycosides by toxicity-metabolism correlation analysis using zebrafish. METHODS: Healthy zebrafish embryos 1 d post fertilization (1 dpf) were exposed to different concentrations of psoralen (PS), isopsoralen (IPS), psoralenoside (PSS) and isopsoralenoside (IPSS). Death numbers of the embryos or larvals were counted from 1 to 5 d after dosing(2-6 dpf); embryonic micro-morphology of zebrafish (3 dpf or 3-6 dpf) was observed and pictures were taken; LC50 value of 6 dpf zebrafish was calculated by SPSS16.0. In addition, a relatively safe concentration of each sample was exposed to 1-6 dpf zebrafish as above and sampled every day to analyze the dynamic metabolites changes. RESULTS: Psoralen and isopsoralen original form caused 3 dpf zebrafish poisoning; while psoralenoside and isopsoralenoside were mainly in original form when zebrafish was 3 dpf, and no obvious morphology changes were observed. But they were transformed by 4-6 dpf zebrafish into psoralen and isopsoralen, respectively, and caused zebrafish poisoning. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of psoralenoside and isopsoralenoside to zebrafish is closely related to the transformation in zebrafish. Psoralen and isopsoralen are not only the original components in Psoralea corylifolia L., but also the metabolic components converted in the body. They are components related to toxicity. The zebrafish toxicity-metabolism correlation method can efficiently identify the in vivo toxicity of micro-components and their correlation with metabolic transformation.

TI  - Chemical-Induced Cleft Palate Is Caused and Rescued by Pharmacological Modulation of the Canonical Wnt Signaling Pathway in a Zebrafish Model
AB  - Cleft palate is one of the most frequent birth defects worldwide. It causes severe problems regarding eating and speaking and requires long-term treatment. Effective prenatal treatment would contribute to reducing the risk of cleft palate. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is critically involved in palatogenesis, and genetic or chemical disturbance of this signaling pathway leads to cleft palate. Presently, preventative treatment for cleft palate during prenatal development has limited efficacy, but we expect that zebrafish will provide a useful high-throughput chemical screening model for effective prevention. To achieve this, the zebrafish model should recapitulate cleft palate development and its rescue by chemical modulation of the Wnt pathway. Here, we provide proof of concept for a zebrafish chemical screening model. Zebrafish embryos were treated with 12 chemical reagents known to induce cleft palate in mammals, and all 12 chemicals induced cleft palate characterized by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of palatal cells. The cleft phenotype was enhanced by combinatorial treatment with Wnt inhibitor and teratogens. Furthermore, the expression of tcf7 and lef1 as a readout of the pathway was decreased. Conversely, cleft palate was prevented by Wnt agonist and the cellular defects were also prevented. In conclusion, we provide evidence that chemical-induced cleft palate is caused by inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway. Our results indicate that this zebrafish model is promising for chemical screening for prevention of cleft palate as well as modulation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target. © Copyright © 2020 Narumi, Liu, Ikeda, Morita and Tasaki.

TI  - Antinociceptive activity of 3β-6β-16β-trihydroxylup-20 (29)-ene triterpene isolated from Combretum leprosum leaves in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Drugs used to treat pain are associated with adverse effects, increasing the search for new drugs as an alternative treatment for pain. Therefore, we evaluated the antinociceptive behavior and possible neuromodulation mechanisms of triterpene 3β, 6β, 16β-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (CLF-1) isolated from Combretum leprosum leaves in zebrafish. Zebrafish (n = 6/group) were pretreated with CLF-1 (0.1 or 0.3 or 1.0 mg/mL; i.p.) and underwent nociception behavior tests. The antinociceptive effect of CFL-1 was tested for modulation by opioid (naloxone), nitrergic (L-NAME), nitric oxide and guanylate cyclase synthesis inhibitor (methylene blue), NMDA (Ketamine), TRPV1 (ruthenium red), TRPA1 (camphor), or ASIC (amiloride) antagonists. The corneal antinociceptive effect of CFL-1 was tested for modulation by TRPV1 (capsazepine). The effect of CFL-1 on zebrafish locomotor behavior was evaluated with the open field test. The acute toxicity study was conducted. CLF-1 reduced nociceptive behavior and corneal in zebrafish without mortalities and without altering the animals’ locomotion. Thus, CFL-1 presenting pharmacological potential for the treatment of acute pain and corneal pain, and this effect is modulated by the opioids, nitrergic system, NMDA receptors and TRP and ASIC channels. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Anti-tuberculosis effect of isoniazid scales accurately from zebrafish to humans
AB  - Background and Purpose: There is a clear need for innovation in anti-tuberculosis drug development. The zebrafish larva is an attractive disease model in tuberculosis research. To translate pharmacological findings to higher vertebrates, including humans, the internal exposure of drugs needs to be quantified and linked to observed response. Experimental Approach: In zebrafish studies, drugs are usually dissolved in the external water, posing a challenge to quantify internal exposure. We developed experimental methods to quantify internal exposure, including nanoscale blood sampling, and to quantify the bacterial burden, using automated fluorescence imaging analysis, with isoniazid as the test compound. We used pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling to quantify the exposure–response relationship responsible for the antibiotic response. To translate isoniazid response to humans, quantitative exposure–response relationships in zebrafish were linked to simulated concentration–time profiles in humans, and two quantitative translational factors on sensitivity to isoniazid and stage of infection were included. Key Results: Blood concentration was only 20% of the external drug concentration. The bacterial burden increased exponentially, and an isoniazid dose corresponding to 15 mg·L−1internal concentration (minimum inhibitory concentration) leads to bacteriostasis of the mycobacterial infection in the zebrafish. The concentration–effect relationship was quantified, and based on that relationship and the translational factors, the isoniazid response was translated to humans, which correlated well with observed data. Conclusions and Implications: This proof of concept study confirmed the potential of zebrafish larvae as tuberculosis disease models in translational pharmacology and contributes to innovative anti-tuberculosis drug development, which is very clearly needed. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the zebrafish touch-evoked response: quantitative vs. qualitative assessment
AB  - Background: The difficulty of finding new treatments for neurological diseases with great impact in our society like Alzheimer’s disease can be ascribed in part to the complexity of the nervous system and the lack of quick and cost-effective screening tools. Such tools could not only help to identify potential novel treatments, but could also be used to test environmental contaminants for their potential to cause neurotoxicity. It has been estimated that 5–10% of the anthropogenic chemicals are developmental neurotoxic (DNT) and exposure to DNT compounds has been linked to several neurological diseases. Within this study we were testing the applicability of a quick and cost-effective behavioural test using zebrafish embryos: the touch-evoked response assay, in this case, an assay evaluating the swimming response to a tap in the tail. Two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors positive controls (paraoxon and huprine Y), as well as 10 huprine-derivative compounds were tested and the results were evaluated using 2 different methods, a quantitative and a qualitative one. Results: We could show that the methodology presented is able to detect behavioural effects of AChE inhibitors. A good correlation between the results obtained with the quantitative and the qualitative method was obtained (R2 = 0.84). Conclusions: Our proposed method enables combination of screening for new drugs with toxicity screening in a whole embryo model alternative to animal experimentation, thereby merging 2 drug development steps into one. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - A high throughput zebrafish chemical screen reveals ALK5 and non-canonical androgen signalling as modulators of the pkd2 −/− phenotype
AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenic cause of end-stage renal failure in humans and results from germline mutations in PKD1 or PKD2. Despite the recent approval of tolvaptan, safer and more effective alternative drugs are clearly needed to slow disease progression. As a first step in drug discovery, we conducted an unbiased chemical screen on zebrafish pkd2 mutant embryos using two publicly available compound libraries (Spectrum, PKIS) totalling 2,367 compounds to identify novel treatments for ADPKD. Using dorsal tail curvature as the assay readout, three major chemical classes (steroids, coumarins, flavonoids) were identified from the Spectrum library as the most promising candidates to be tested on human PKD1 cystic cells. Amongst these were an androgen, 5α−androstane 3,17-dione, detected as the strongest enhancer of the pkd2 phenotype but whose effect was found to be independent of the canonical androgen receptor pathway. From the PKIS library, we identified several ALK5 kinase inhibitors as strong suppressors of the pkd2 tail phenotype and in vitro cyst expansion. In summary, our results identify ALK5 and non-canonical androgen receptors as potential therapeutic targets for further evaluation in drug development for ADPKD. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Zebrafish as a model to study autophagy and its role in skeletal development and disease
AB  - In the last twenty years, research using zebrafish as a model organism has increased immensely. With the many advantages that zebrafish offer such as high fecundity, optical transparency, ex vivo development, and genetic tractability, they are well suited to studying developmental processes and the effect of genetic mutations. More recently, zebrafish models have been used to study autophagy. This important protein degradation pathway is needed for cell and tissue homeostasis in a variety of contexts. Correspondingly, its dysregulation has been implicated in multiple diseases including skeletal disorders. In this review, we explore how zebrafish are being used to study autophagy in the context of skeletal development and disease, and the ways these areas are intersecting to help identify potential therapeutic targets for skeletal disorders. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-recognized anthropogenic xenoestrogen, has been identified as a causative agent responsible for inducing carcinogenicity, cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, etc. However, BPA-induced neurotoxicity and its possible amelioration through natural compound intervention remain elusive. The current study was performed to elucidate the neurotoxic potential of BPA in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by waterborne exposure and its possible amelioration by quercetin co-supplementation. Protective effect of quercetin against BPA-induced altered neurobehavioral response, oxidative stress and neuromorphological changes were evaluated in zebrafish brain. The present findings reveal that BPA-induced altered neurobehavioral response was ameliorated by quercetin. Biochemical studies advocate the potential therapeutic efficacy of quercetin against BPA-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish brain. Quercetin also shows neuroprotection against BPA-induced augmented neuronal pyknosis in periventricular grey zone (PGZ) of zebrafish brain. These basic findings indicate that quercetin may act as an effective intervention against BPA-induced neurotoxicity in zebrafish through down-regulation of oxidative stress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - High-throughput animal tracking in chemobehavioral phenotyping: Current limitations and future perspectives
AB  - Behavioral phenotyping is an essential part of neuro-active drug discovery and predictive neurotoxicology. Due to limitations of conventional rodent in vivo models, chemobehavioral phenotypic analysis utilizing innovative small model organisms; such as nematodes, planarians and zebrafish are emerging as distinctively advantageous for high-throughput phenotypic discovery of neuroceuticals and evaluating deleterious effects of industrial pollutants on the central nervous system. Digital film recording with subsequent analysis of video sequences using specialised animal tracking software has become a standard in obtaining behavioral biometric data. At present animal tracking algorithms are largely capable of detecting and tracking small number of animals and extracting quantitative endpoints associated with specific behavioral traits based on reconstruction of movement trajectories and occupancy heatmaps. However, despite recent and significant progress in development of diverse proxy biological models, the software algorithms still lack the ability to track multiple organisms on a large scale, automatically generate behavioral fingerprints and utilize intensive computational approaches to mine rich biometric data. This creates a significant bottleneck for effective high-throughput chemobehavioral screening in drug discovery and neurotoxicology. This review outlines recent advances as well as limitations of high-throughput animal tracking and provides an outlook on future developments in rapidly evolving field of neurobehavioral phenomics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Is the orofacial antinociceptive effect of lectins intrinsically related to their specificity to monosaccharides?
AB  - Lectins are proteins of non-immunological origin that may play several biological applications, of which we can highlight the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. In this work, we evaluated the possible effect of orofacial antinociceptive activity of three plant lectins, Dioclea violacea (DVL - Man/Glc-binding), Vatairea macrocarpa (VML - Gal-binding) and PPL (Parkia platycephala - Man/Glc-binding) in adult zebrafish. Acute nociception was induced by menthol (1.2 μM), or capsaicin (4.93 μM) applied into in the upper lip (5.0 μL) of adult wild zebrafish. Zebrafish were pretreated by intraperitoneal injection (20 μL) with vehicle (Control) or lectins (0.025; 0.05 or 0.1 mg/mL) 30 min before induction. The effect of lectins on zebrafish locomotor behavior was evaluated with the open field test. Naive groups (n = 8) were included in all tests. Our results indicate that only PPL presented antinociceptive induced by capsaicin, suggesting the potential clinical application of PPL as inhibitor of orofacial nociception and that this effect may be due to the modulation of TRPV1 channel. In conclusion, lectins that exhibit affinity to the same or different carbohydrates do not necessarily have an antinociceptive effect on the orofacial nociception model, indicating that the glycan carbohydrate binding pattern may be related to the effect on nociception inhibition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Zebrafish as a successful animal model for screening toxicity of medicinal plants
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is used as an embryonic and larval model to perform in vitro experiments and developmental toxicity studies. Zebrafish may be used to determine the toxicity of samples in early screening assays, often in a high-throughput manner. The zebrafish embryotoxicity model is at the leading edge of toxicology research due to the short time required for analyses, transparency of embryos, short life cycle, high fertility, and genetic data similarity. Zebrafish toxicity studies range from assessing the toxicity of bioactive compounds or crude extracts from plants to determining the optimal process. Most of the studied extracts were polar, such as ethanol, methanol, and aqueous solutions, which were used to detect the toxicity and bioactivity. This review examines the latest research using zebrafish as a study model and highlights its power as a tool for detecting toxicity of medicinal plants and its effectiveness at enhancing the understanding of new drug generation. The goal of this review was to develop a link to ethnopharmacological zebrafish studies that can be used by other researchers to conduct future research. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Phenolic profile of herbal infusion and polyphenol-rich extract from leaves of the medicinal plant antirhea borbonica: Toxicity assay determination in zebrafish embryos and larvae
AB  - Antirhea borbonica (A. borbonica) is an endemic plant from the Mascarene archipelago in the Indian Ocean commonly used in traditional medicine for its health benefits. This study aims (1) at exploring polyphenols profiles from two types of extracts-aqueous (herbal infusion) and acetonic (polyphenol rich) extracts from A. borbonica leaves-and (2) at evaluating their potential toxicity in vivo for the first time. We first demonstrated that, whatever type of extraction is used, both extracts displayed significant antioxidant properties and acid phenolic and flavonoid contents. By using selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we performed polyphenol identification and quantification. Among the 19 identified polyphenols, we reported that the main ones were caffeic acid derivatives and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. Then, we performed a Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity test to assess the toxicity of both extracts following the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. In both zebrafish embryos and larvae, the polyphenols-rich extract obtained by acetonic extraction followed by evaporation and resuspension in water exhibits a higher toxic effect with a median lethal concentration (LC50: 5.6 g/L) compared to the aqueous extract (LC50: 20.3 g/L). Our data also reveal that at non-lethal concentrations of 2.3 and 7.2 g/L for the polyphenol-rich extract and herbal infusion, respectively, morphological malformations such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema, and developmental delay may occur. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that the evaluation of the toxicity of medicinal plants should be systematically carried out and considered when studying therapeutic effects on living organisms. © 2020 MDPI AG.

TI  - Translational toxicology in zebrafish
AB  - A major goal of translational toxicology is to identify adverse chemical effects and determine whether they are conserved or divergent across experimental systems. Translational toxicology encompasses assessment of chemical toxicity across multiple life stages, determination of toxic mode of action, computational prediction modeling, and identification of interventions that protect or restore health after toxic chemical exposures. The zebrafish is increasingly used in translational toxicology because it combines the genetic and physiological advantages of mammalian models with the higher-throughput capabilities and genetic manipulability of invertebrate models. Here, we review the recent literature demonstrating the power of the zebrafish as a model for addressing all four activities of translational toxicology. Important data gaps and challenges associated with using zebrafish for translational toxicology are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Acute and long-term metabolic consequences of early developmental Bisphenol A exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic contaminant linked to metabolic disruption. Developmental BPA exposure is of particular concern, as organizational effects may irreversibly disrupt metabolism at later life-stages. While BPA exposures in adult fish elicit metabolic perturbations similar to effects described in rodents, the metabolic effects of developmental BPA exposure in juvenile fish remain largely unknown. Following embryonic zebrafish exposure to BPA (0.1, 1 and 4 mg/L) and EE2 (10 ng/L) from 2 to 5 dpf, we assessed the metabolic phenotype in larvae (4–6 dpf) and juveniles (43–49 dpf) which had been divided into regular-fed and overfed groups at 29 dpf. Developmental BPA exposure in larvae dose-dependently reduced food-intake and locomotion and increased energy expenditure. Juveniles (29 dpf) exhibited a transient increase in body weight after developmental BPA exposure and persistent diet-dependent locomotion changes (43–49 dpf). At the molecular level, glucose and lipid metabolism-related transcript abundance clearly separated BPA exposed fish from controls and EE2 exposed fish at the larval stage, in juveniles on a regular diet and, to a lesser extent, in overfed juveniles. In general, the metabolic endpoints affected by BPA exposure were not mimicked by EE2 treatment. We conclude that developmental BPA exposure elicits acute metabolic effects in zebrafish larvae and fewer transient and persistent effects in juveniles and that these metabolic effects are largely independent of BPA's estrogenicity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A great catch for investigating inborn errors of metabolism—insights obtained from zebrafish
AB  - Inborn errors of metabolism cause abnormal synthesis, recycling, or breakdown of amino acids, neurotransmitters, and other various metabolites. This aberrant homeostasis commonly causes the accumulation of toxic compounds or depletion of vital metabolites, which has detrimental consequences for the patients. Efficient and rapid intervention is often key to survival. Therefore, it requires useful animal models to understand the pathomechanisms and identify promising therapeutic drug targets. Zebrafish are an effective tool to investigate developmental mechanisms and understanding the pathophysiology of disorders. In the past decades, zebrafish have proven their efficiency for studying genetic disorders owing to the high degree of conservation between human and zebrafish genes. Subsequently, several rare inherited metabolic disorders have been successfully investigated in zebrafish revealing underlying mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets, including methylmalonic acidemia, Gaucher’s disease, maple urine disorder, hyperammonemia, TRAPPC11-CDGs, and others. This review summarizes the recent impact zebrafish have made in the field of inborn errors of metabolism. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Light and Hormones in Seasonal Regulation of Reproduction and Mood
AB  - Organisms that inhabit the temperate zone exhibit various seasonal adaptive behaviors, including reproduction, hibernation, molting, and migration. Day length, known as photoperiod, is the most noise-free and widely used environmental cue that enables animals to anticipate the oncoming seasons and adapt their physiologies accordingly. Although less clear, some human traits also exhibit seasonality, such as birthrate, mood, cognitive brain responses, and various diseases. However, the molecular basis for human seasonality is poorly understood. Herein, we first review the underlying mechanisms of seasonal adaptive strategies of animals, including seasonal reproduction and stress responses during the breeding season. We then briefly summarize our recent discovery of signaling pathways involved in the winter depression-like phenotype in medaka fish. We believe that exploring the regulation of seasonal traits in animal models will provide insight into human seasonality and aid in the understanding of human diseases such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). © 2020 Endocrine Society 2020.

TI  - Exposure to the Heavy-Metal Lead Induces DNA Copy Number Alterations in Zebrafish Cells
AB  - DNA copy number variants are associated with the development of complex neurological diseases and disorders including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Exposure to multiple environmental chemicals including various heavy metals is suggested as a risk factor in these neurological diseases and disorders, but few studies have addressed if heavy-metal exposure can result in de novo DNA copy number changes as a genetic mechanism contributing to these disease outcomes. In this study to further investigate the relationship between heavy-metal exposure and de novo copy number alterations (CNAs), zebrafish fibroblast cells were exposed to the neurotoxicant lead (Pb). A crystal violet assay was first used to determine exposure concentrations with >80% cell confluency. Then a zebrafish-specific array comparative genomic hybridization platform was used to detect CNAs following a 72 h Pb exposure (0.24, 2.4, or 24 μM). The Pb exposure resulted in 72 CNA amplifications ranging in size from 5 to 329 kb. No deletions were detected. CNAs resulted in 15 CNA regions (CNARs), leaving 7 singlet CNAs. Two of the singlets were within high repeat genomic locations. The number of CNAs tended to increase in a concentration-dependent manner. Several CNARs encompassed genes previously reported to have altered expression with Pb exposure, suggesting a mechanistic link. In addition, almost all genes are associated within a molecular network with amyloid precursor protein, a key molecular target associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Overall, these findings show that Pb exposure results in de novo CNAs that could serve as a mechanism driving adverse health outcomes associated with Pb toxicity including neurological disease pathogenesis for further study. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Genetic engineering of zebrafish in cancer research
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent model to study a wide diversity of human cancers. In this review, we provide an overview of the genetic and reverse genetic toolbox allowing the generation of zebrafish lines that develop tumors. The large spectrum of genetic tools enables the engineering of zebrafish lines harboring precise genetic alterations found in human patients, the generation of zebrafish carrying somatic or germline inheritable mutations or zebrafish showing conditional expression of the oncogenic mutations. Comparative transcriptomics demonstrate that many of the zebrafish tumors share molecular signatures similar to those found in human cancers. Thus, zebrafish cancer models provide a unique in vivo platform to investigate cancer initiation and progression at the molecular and cellular levels, to identify novel genes involved in tumorigenesis as well as to contemplate new therapeutic strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) treatment by neutralization: Evaluation of physical-chemical performance and ecotoxicological effects on zebrafish (Danio rerio) development
AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) represents a major problem in the mining industry worldwide due to the risk of water and soil pollution. Its active treatment involves the addition of alkaline reagents such as NaOH or Ca(OH)2 to increase the pH and precipitate the dissolved metals, although substantial amounts of dissolved ions might persists. Under a remediation approach, the aim of this work was to assess the chemical and physical characteristics of treated effluent and to evaluate its ecotoxicological effects on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic and larval stages, through developmental, functional, morphological, and behavioral end-points. The studied AMD sample, highly associated with pyrite, presented high sulfate and dissolved metal ions content and was submitted to the following treatment conditions: NaOH - pH 7.0 and 8.7, and Ca(OH)2 - pH 7.0 and 8.7. All neutralizing treatments resulted in a satisfactory reduction of the metals concentration, with best results achieved using Ca(OH)2 at pH 8.7; although Mn and As still remained above or very near the discharge maximum limits according to Brazilian legislation. Therefore, an additional step was employed to Mn and As adsorption by algal biomass. Regarding in-vivo toxicological assays, no significant lethality was recorded in all treated AMD groups, although adverse effects were observed in all endpoints analyzed. Ca(OH)2 groups performed closer to control than NaOH-treated groups. The additional polishing stage treatment with the algae Scenesmus sp. allowed tenuous improvements in terms of removal of residual amounts of As and Mn but not in the toxicological characteristics of treated AMD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Zebrafish Xenografts for Drug Discovery and Personalized Medicine
AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world. Given that cancer is a highly individualized disease, predicting the best chemotherapeutic treatment for individual patients can be difficult. Ex vivo models such as mouse patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids are being developed to predict patient-specific chemosensitivity profiles before treatment in the clinic. Although promising, these models have significant disadvantages including long growth times that introduce genetic and epigenetic changes to the tumor. The zebrafish xenograft assay is ideal for personalized medicine. Imaging of the small, transparent fry is unparalleled among vertebrate organisms. In addition, the speed (5–7 days) and small patient tissue requirements (100–200 cells per animal) are unique features of the zebrafish xenograft model that enable patient-specific chemosensitivity analyses. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Ligand-centred redox activation of inert organoiridium anticancer catalysts
AB  - Organometallic complexes with novel activation mechanisms are attractive anticancer drug candidates. Here, we show that half-sandwich iodido cyclopentadienyl iridium(iii) azopyridine complexes exhibit potent antiproliferative activity towards cancer cells, in most cases more potent than cisplatin. Despite their inertness towards aquation, these iodido complexes can undergo redox activation by attack of the abundant intracellular tripeptide glutathione (GSH) on the chelated azopyridine ligand to generate paramagnetic intermediates, and hydroxyl radicals, together with thiolate-bridged dinuclear iridium complexes, and liberate reduced hydrazopyridine ligand. DFT calculations provided insight into the mechanism of this activation. GS−attack on the azo bond facilitates the substitution of iodide by GS−, and leads to formation of GSSG and superoxide if O2is present as an electron-acceptor, in a largely exergonic pathway. Reactions of these iodido complexes with GSH generateIr-SGcomplexes, which are catalysts for GSH oxidation. The complexes promoted elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human lung cancer cells. This remarkable ligand-centred activation mechanism coupled to redox reactions adds a new dimension to the design of organoiridium anticancer prodrugs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

TI  - Modeling Lysosomal Storage Diseases in the Zebrafish
AB  - Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a family of 70 metabolic disorders characterized by mutations in lysosomal proteins that lead to storage material accumulation, multiple-organ pathologies that often involve neurodegeneration, and early mortality in a significant number of patients. Along with the necessity for more effective therapies, there exists an unmet need for further understanding of disease etiology, which could uncover novel pathways and drug targets. Over the past few decades, the growth in knowledge of disease-associated pathways has been facilitated by studies in model organisms, as advancements in mutagenesis techniques markedly improved the efficiency of model generation in mammalian and non-mammalian systems. In this review we highlight non-mammalian models of LSDs, focusing specifically on the zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism that shares remarkable genetic and metabolic similarities with mammals while also conferring unique advantages such as optical transparency and amenability toward high-throughput applications. We examine published zebrafish LSD models and their reported phenotypes, address organism-specific advantages and limitations, and discuss recent technological innovations that could provide potential solutions. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang and Peterson.

TI  - Determining the Biological Mechanisms of Action for Environmental Exposures: Applying CRISPR/Cas9 to Toxicological Assessments
AB  - Toxicology is a constantly evolving field, especially in the area of developing alternatives to animal testing. Toxicological research must evolve and utilize adaptive technologies in an effort to improve public, environmental, and occupational health. The most commonly cited mechanisms of toxic action after exposure to a chemical or particle test substance is oxidative stress. However, because oxidative stress involves a plethora of genes and proteins, the exact mechanism(s) are not commonly defined. Exact mechanisms of toxicity can be revealed using an emerging laboratory technique referred to as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). This article reviews the most common CRISPR techniques utilized today and how each may be applied in Toxicological Sciences. Specifically, the CRISPR/CRISPR-associated protein complex is used for single gene knock-outs, whereas CRISPR interference/activation is used for silencing or activating (respectively) ribonucleic acid. Finally, CRISPR libraries are used for knocking-out entire gene pathways. This review highlights the application of CRISPR in toxicology to elucidate the exact mechanism through which toxicants perturb normal cellular functions. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Isoliquiritigenin triggers developmental toxicity and oxidative stress–mediated apoptosis in zebrafish embryos/larvae via Nrf2-HO1/JNK-ERK/mitochondrion pathway
AB  - Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is an emerging natural flavonoid found in the roots of licorice, exhibits antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective properties. However, the effect of ISL in embryonic development is yet to be elucidated, and the mechanisms underlying its target-organ toxicity and harmful side effects are still unclear. In the present study, we employed zebrafish embryos to study the developmental toxicity effect of ISL and its underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish embryos upon treatment with either vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) or ISL solutions for 4–96 h post fertilization (hpf) showed that ISL exposure instigated severe developmental toxicity in heart, liver, and nervous system. Mortality and morphological abnormalities were also observed. High concentrations of ISL exposure resulted in abnormal phenotypes and embryonic malformations including pericardial edema, swim bladder defects, yolk retention, curved body shape and shortening of body length. Moreover, ISL exposure led to significant loss of dopaminergic neurons accompanied by reduced locomotor behaviour. Apoptotic cells were predominantly located in the heart area of 96 hpf embryo. Additionally, ISL significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation content and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities. The expressions pattern of apoptosis-related genes Bad, Cyto c, Caspase-9, Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 indicated that the oxidative stress–induced apoptosis triggered by ISL suggest involvement of Nrf2-HO1/JNK-ERK/mitochondrion pathways. In conclusion, here we provide first evidence that demonstrate ISL-induced dose-dependent developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, gene expression patterns in the embryos correlate the above and reveal potential genetic mechanisms of developmental toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Seasonal changes in NRF2 antioxidant pathway regulates winter depression-like behavior
AB  - Seasonal changes in the environment lead to depression-like behaviors in humans and animals. The underlying mechanisms, however, are unknown. We observed decreased sociability and increased anxiety-like behavior in medaka fish exposed to winter-like conditions. Whole brain metabolomic analysis revealed seasonal changes in 68 metabolites, including neurotransmitters and antioxidants associated with depression. Transcriptome analysis identified 3,306 differentially expressed transcripts, including inflammatory markers, melanopsins, and circadian clock genes. Further analyses revealed seasonal changes in multiple signaling pathways implicated in depression, including the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) antioxidant pathway. A broad-spectrum chemical screen revealed that celastrol (a traditional Chinese medicine) uniquely reversed winter behavior. NRF2 is a celastrol target expressed in the habenula (HB), known to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression. Another NRF2 chemical activator phenocopied these effects, and an NRF2 mutant showed decreased sociability. Our study provides important insights into winter depression and offers potential therapeutic targets involving NRF2. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

TI  - Drug screening of primary patient derived tumor xenografts in zebrafish
AB  - Patient derived xenograft models are critical in defining how different cancers respond to drug treatment in an in vivo system. Mouse models are the standard in the field, but zebrafish have emerged as an alternative model with several advantages, including the ability for high-throughput and low-cost drug screening. Zebrafish also allow for in vivo drug screening with large replicate numbers that were previously only obtainable with in vitro systems. The ability to rapidly perform large scale drug screens may open up the possibility for personalized medicine with rapid translation of results back to clinic. Zebrafish xenograft models could also be used to rapidly screen for actionable mutations based on tumor response to targeted therapies or to identify new anti-cancer compounds from large libraries. The current major limitation in the field has been quantifying and automating the process so that drug screens can be done on a larger scale and be less labor-intensive. We have developed a workflow for xenografting primary patient samples into zebrafish larvae and performing large scale drug screens using a fluorescence microscope equipped imaging unit and automated sampler unit. This method allows for standardization and quantification of engrafted tumor area and response to drug treatment across large numbers of zebrafish larvae. Overall, this method is advantageous over traditional cell culture drug screening as it allows for growth of tumor cells in an in vivo environment throughout drug treatment, and is more practical and cost-effective than mice for large scale in vivo drug screens. © 2020 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Persistent exposure to natural and synthetic chemicals is an unavoidable part of living on our planet; yet, we understand very little about the effects of exposure to the vast majority of chemicals. While epidemiological studies can provide strong statistical inference linking chemical exposure to disease, research in model systems is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of action and to predict outcomes. Most research in toxicology utilizes a handful of mammalian models that represent a few distinct branches of the evolutionary tree. This narrow focus constrains the understanding of chemical-induced disease processes and systems that have evolved in response to exposures. We advocate for casting awider net in environmental toxicology research to utilize diverse model systems, including zebrafish, and perform more mechanistic studies of cellular responses to chemical exposures to shift the perception of toxicology as an applied science to that of a basic science. This more-inclusive perspective will enrich the field and should remain central to research on chemical-induced disease. © 2020 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Municipal wastewater effluent exposure disrupts early development, larval behavior, and stress response in zebrafish
AB  - Our results demonstrate that short-term exposures to tertiary-treated MWWEs affect ELS development, embryo and larval behaviors, and the juvenile stress response in zebrafish. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWhile wastewater treatment standards have been progressively increasing, emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals can nonetheless pass through treatment and end up in our watersheds. Pharmaceuticals in the parts-per-billion range can impact fish behavior, survival, and recruitment in the wild. However, the ecological risk posed by whole municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), a complex mixture, is not clear. This knowledge gap is particularly evident for early lifestages (ELS) of fish, and because effluent discharge events are typically short, the effects of short-term MWWE exposures to ELS fish are particularly important from an environmental perspective. Here we tested the effects of rapid 30-min exposures, and short-term 24- and 72-h exposures to MWWE on development, behaviors, and stress response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, larvae, and juveniles. We obtained 24-h composite samples of tertiary-treated MWWE that contained a mixture of chemicals with affinities for serotonergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and ion-channel receptors. Embryos exposed to 5%, 10%, and 50% MWWE experienced developmental delays in somitogenesis and hatching rate, although there was no effect on survival. Embryonic photomotor responses were affected following 30-min and 24-h exposures to 10% and 50% MWWE, and larval visual motor responses were reduced from 24-h exposure to 10% MWWE. Exposure to 10% MWWE dulled the juvenile cortisol and lactate response following an acute air-exposure. Compromised behavioral and stress performances demonstrate the capacity of MWWE to impact phenotypes critical to the survival of fish in the environment. Taken together, we found that zebrafish were sensitive to toxic effects of MWWE at multiple life-stages. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Developmental exposure to Pb2+ induces transgenerational changes to zebrafish brain transcriptome
AB  - Lead (Pb2+) is a major public health hazard for urban children, with profound and well-characterized developmental and behavioral implications across the lifespan. The ability of early Pb2+ exposure to induce epigenetic changes is well-established, suggesting that Pb2+-induced neurobehavioral deficits may be heritable across generations. Understanding the long-term and multigenerational repercussions of lead exposure is crucial for clarifying both the genotypic alterations behind these behavioral outcomes and the potential mechanism of heritability. To study this, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (&lt;2 h post fertilization; EK strain) were exposed for 24 h to waterborne Pb2+ at a concentration of 10 μM. This exposed F0 generation was raised to adulthood and spawned to produce the F1 generation, which was subsequently spawned to produce the F2 generation. Previous avoidance conditioning studies determined that a 10 μM Pb2+ dose resulted in learning impairments persisting through the F2 generation. RNA was extracted from control- and 10 μM Pb2+-lineage F2 brains, (n = 10 for each group), sequenced, and transcript expression was quantified utilizing Quant-Seq. 648 genes were differentially expressed in the brains of F2 lead-lineage fish versus F2 control-lineage fish. Pathway analysis revealed altered genes in processes including synaptic function and plasticity, neurogenesis, endocrine homeostasis, and epigenetic modification, all of which are implicated in lead-induced neurobehavioral deficits and/or their inheritance. These data will inform future investigations to elucidate the mechanism of adult-onset and transgenerational health effects of developmental lead exposure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The macrophage-expressed gene (mpeg) 1 identifies a subpopulation of B cells in the adult zebrafish
AB  - The mononuclear phagocytic system consists of many cells, in particular macrophages, scattered throughout the body. However, there is increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of tissue-resident macrophages, leading to a pressing need for new tools to discriminate mononuclear phagocytic system subsets from other hematopoietic lineages. Macrophage-expressed gene (Mpeg)1.1 is an evolutionary conserved gene encoding perforin-2, a pore-forming protein associated with host defense against pathogens. Zebrafish mpeg1.1:GFP and mpeg1.1:mCherry reporters were originally established to specifically label macrophages. Since then more than 100 peer-reviewed publications have made use of mpeg1.1-driven transgenics for in vivo studies, providing new insights into key aspects of macrophage ontogeny, activation, and function. Whereas the macrophage-specific expression pattern of the mpeg1.1 promoter has been firmly established in the zebrafish embryo, it is currently not known whether this specificity is maintained through adulthood. Here we report direct evidence that beside macrophages, a subpopulation of B-lymphocytes is marked by mpeg1.1 reporters in most adult zebrafish organs. These mpeg1.1+ lymphoid cells endogenously express mpeg1.1 and can be separated from mpeg1.1+ macrophages by virtue of their light-scatter characteristics using FACS. Remarkably, our analyses also revealed that B-lymphocytes, rather than mononuclear phagocytes, constitute the main mpeg1.1-positive population in irf8null myeloid-defective mutants, which were previously reported to recover tissue-resident macrophages in adulthood. One notable exception is skin macrophages, whose development and maintenance appear to be independent from irf8, similar to mammals. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that irf8 functions in myelopoiesis are evolutionary conserved and highlight the need for alternative macrophage-specific markers to study the mononuclear phagocytic system in adult zebrafish. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Zebrafish avatars towards personalized medicine— a comparative review between avatar models
AB  - Cancer frequency and prevalence have been increasing in the past decades, with devastating impacts on patients and their families. Despite the great advances in targeted approaches, there is still a lack of methods to predict individual patient responses, and therefore treatments are tailored according to average response rates. “Omics” approaches are used for patient stratification and choice of therapeutic options towards a more precise medicine. These methods, however, do not consider all genetic and non-genetic dynamic interactions that occur upon drug treatment. Therefore, the need to directly challenge patient cells in a personalized manner remains. The present review addresses the state of the art of patient-derived in vitro and in vivo models, from organoids to mouse and zebrafish Avatars. The predictive power of each model based on the retrospective correlation with the patient clinical outcome will be considered. Finally, the review is focused on the emerging zebrafish Avatars and their unique characteristics allowing a fast analysis of local and systemic effects of drug treatments at the single-cell level. We also address the technical challenges that the field has yet to overcome. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Identification of antiparkinsonian drugs in the 6-hydroxydopamine zebrafish model
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is known as a movement disorder due to characteristic motor features. Existing therapies for PD are only symptomatic, and their efficacy decreases as disease progresses. Zebrafish, a vertebrate in which parkinsonism has been modelled, offers unique features for the identification of molecules with antiparkinsonian properties. Here, we developed a screening assay for the selection of neuroactive agents with antiparkinsonian potential. First, we performed a pharmacological validation of the phenotypes exhibited by the 6-hydroxydopamine zebrafish model, by testing the effects of known antiparkinsonian agents. These drugs were also tested for disease-modifying properties by whole mount immunohistochemistry to TH+ neurons and confocal microscopy in the dopaminergic diencephalic cluster of zebrafish. Next, we optimized a phenotypic screening using the 6-hydroxydopamine zebrafish model and tested 1600 FDA-approved bioactive drugs. We found that 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned zebrafish larvae exhibit bradykinetic and dyskinetic-like behaviours that are rescued by the administration of levodopa, rasagiline, isradipine or amantadine. The rescue of dopaminergic cell loss by isradipine was also verified, through the observation of a higher number of TH+ neurons in 6-OHDA-lesioned zebrafish larvae treated with this compound as compared to untreated lesioned larvae. The phenotypic screening enabled us to identify several compounds previously positioned for PD, as well as, new molecules with potential antiparkinsonian properties. Among these, we selected stavudine, tapentadol and nabumetone as the most promising candidates. Our results demonstrate the functional similarities of the motor impairments exhibited by 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned zebrafish with mammalian models of PD and with PD patients, and highlights novel molecules with antiparkinsonian potential. © 2019

TI  - Use of Zebrafish in Drug Discovery Toxicology
AB  - Unpredicted human safety events in clinical trials for new drugs are costly in terms of human health and money. The drug discovery industry attempts to minimize those events with diligent preclinical safety testing. Current standard practices are good at preventing toxic compounds from being tested in the clinic; however, false negative preclinical toxicity results are still a reality. Continual improvement must be pursued in the preclinical realm. Higher-quality therapies can be brought forward with more information about potential toxicities and associated mechanisms. The zebrafish model is a bridge between in vitro assays and mammalian in vivo studies. This model is powerful in its breadth of application and tractability for research. In the past two decades, our understanding of disease biology and drug toxicity has grown significantly owing to thousands of studies on this tiny vertebrate. This Review summarizes challenges and strengths of the model, discusses the 3Rs value that it can deliver, highlights translatable and untranslatable biology, and brings together reports from recent studies with zebrafish focusing on new drug discovery toxicology. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Evaluation of acute oral toxicity, embryotoxicity and cytotoxicity of the polar fraction of Parkinsonia aculeata aerial parts extract
AB  - Ethnopharmacobotanical information reports that Parkinsonia aculeata infusion is used to control diabetes-related complications and dyslipidemia. However, few studies are reported on the safe use of this species. The aim of this study is to evaluate the acute toxicity, embryotoxicity and cytotoxicity of a polar fraction obtained from hydroethanolic extract of P. aculeata (PfrHEPA). For the acute toxicity test, we considered the Up and Down method which the guidelines are described by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD N◦425). The animals were treated with PfrHEPA (2000 mg/kg) or with distilled water (10 ml/kg) by gavage and observed from Day 1 to14. For embryotoxicity assay, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PfrHEPA (100 mg/L) and toxicity parameters were observed during four consecutive days. The cytotoxicity of PfrHEPA (5, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μg/ml, respectively) was performed on normal cell lines (mesenchymal stem cells, African green monkey renal cells and mouse pre-adipocytes 3 T3-L1 using the MTT salt reduction assay. In the acute toxicity test, no mortality was observed in mice treated with PfrHEPA (2000 mg/kg), as well as behavioral changes, histopathological abnormalities and hematological and biochemical variables. In the embryotoxicity test, no abnormal changes related to the toxicological parameters were observed in the period of 96 h. Regarding the cytotoxicity assay, PfrHEPA showed no cytotoxic effect on the normal cell lines tested, with an IC50 value &gt; 100 μg/ml. These results suggest the safe use of P. aculeata, however, more trials are needed for PfrHEPA to be presented as new safe therapeutic proposal for the control of metabolic disorders. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Exploration of mechanistic insights of acemetacin in melanogenesis through zebrafish model, enzyme kinetics, molecular docking and simulation approaches
AB  - The present study describes the anti-melanogenesis effect of Acemetacin (ACE). Essential protein (melanin) that is vital for the skin for defense from UV rays. In the present research, emerging drug ACE was examined for its melanin inhibition using three different (in vitro, in vivo and computational) methods. ACE showed remarkable potency (IC50 = 0.353 ± 0.003 µM) against tyrosinase in the comparison of standard, kojic acid (IC50 = 16.841 ± 1.161 µM) and ACE exhibited competitive inhibition. In the in vivo study zebrafish embryos were exposed with 5, 10, 15 and 20 µM of ACE and same doses for positive control (Kojic Acid). At 72 h treatment, ACE expressively (P&lt;0.001) reduced the level of pigmentation (62.89%) at a concentration of 20 µM, relative to that of kojic acid (39.64%). The binding profile of ACE was confirmed by molecular docking and the stability of the docked complexes was justified by MD simulation. Based on our results, it was concluded that ACE possessed good therapeutic potential against melanogenesis by targeting the tyrosinase. © 2020, University of Sindh. All rights reserved.

TI  - Zebrafish: A laboratory model to evaluate nanoparticle toxicity
AB  - Presently, nanoparticles (NPs) technology is a booming business marked by a significantly fast growth rate that covers a wide range of industries. NPs demand increases and they have a potential market value. The nanotoxicity sector has grown significantly for the last 10-15 years, which will pose serious problems in the coming future. Nano-toxicology is an innovative area of toxicological study that assesses the toxicological assets of NPs to decide whether they constitute a risk or an ecological problem and to what degree. To assess the different NPs toxicity, numerous nanotoxicological studies were piloted using different methods. The vital mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity were recently studied especially in aquatic wildlife. In recent years, nanoparticle toxicity evaluation amplified exponentially by using zebrafish as an animal prototypical system. Zebrafish has been tested as an established model system for experimental biological study and are evolving as a solid nanotoxicity prototype which is progressively used as an in vivo model. It is principally used as a platform for rapid testing and assortment of molecules in the object or phenotype techniques. It offers a number of advantages over other living prototypes by offering prospects to speedily screen nanoparticulate medicines beneath in-vivo environments, also an economical way to link the present gap among in vitro and vertebrate studies. Many researchers have summarized experimental parameters critically used by zebrafish as an animal model for biomedical tests such as sample size, organ, and type wild against transgenic lines. Current chapter will discuss considerable factors of experimentation, advantages, and usage of zebrafish in nanomedicine; different methods of evaluating the nanotoxicity such as hatching exploration; malformation of embryos and organs of development; genetically modified zebrafish by means of living biosensor; disturbance in the endocrine system, skin, and gill; reproductive toxicity; genotoxicity; neurotoxicity; immune-toxicity; and behavioral analysis. Furthermore, it will also discuss an overview of studies about investigation of the toxicity of silver, carbon nanotube, metal oxide, and quantum dots nanoparticles using zebrafish. At the end, future lookouts of zebrafish model are discussed. It is projected that this chapter will update study directed at emerging biocompatible nanoparticulates for a choice of uses and toxicity investigation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

TI  - Supercritical CO2 Processing Generates Aqueous Cisplatin Solutions with Enhanced Cancer Specificity
AB  - Cisplatin is a highly toxic material used clinically as a potent chemotherapeutic. While effective against some cancers, toxicity limits widespread use and low solubility confounds delivery. To formulate a better tolerated and more water-soluble form of cisplatin, we designed a rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) technique with supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2) to collect nanoclusters of cisplatin embedded in dry ice, in a dual-stage collection vessel cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. These nanoclusters were solubilized in deionized water and further concentrated (up to 51.3 mM) by a Rotovap process, yielding stable cisplatin solutions with solubility up to 15 × (w/w) greater than that of normal cisplatin. Extensive material characterizations of the solutions were carried out to determine any chemical and/or structural changes of the RESS-processed cisplatin. In vitro cytotoxicity studies of these aqueous solutions showed increased cell viability and early apoptosis compared to equivalent concentrations of standard cisplatin solutions. In vivo studies using zebrafish embryos revealed that standard cisplatin solutions were acutely toxic and caused death of rapidly proliferating cells compared to RESS-processed cisplatin, which were better tolerated with reduced general cell death. Increased water solubility and matched chemical identity of RESS-processed aqueous cisplatin solutions indicate the potential to open up novel drug-delivery routes, which is beneficial for new pharmaceutical design and development. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Inductively coupled magic angle spinning microresonators benchmarked for high-resolution single embryo metabolomic profiling
AB  - The magic angle coil spinning (MACS) technique has been introduced as a very promising extension for solid state NMR detection, demonstrating sensitivity enhancements by a factor of 14 from the very first time it has been reported. The main beneficiary of this technique is the scientific community dealing with mass- and volume-limited, rare, or expensive samples. However, more than a decade after the first report on MACS, there is a very limited number of groups who have continued to develop the technique, let alone it being widely adopted by practitioners. This might be due to several drawbacks associated with the MACS technology until now, including spectral linewidth, heating due to eddy currents, and imprecise manufacturing. Here, we report a device overcoming all these remaining issues, therefore achieving: (1) spectral resolution of approx 0.01 ppm and normalized limit of detection of approx. 13 nmol s0.5 calculated using the anomeric proton of sucrose at 3 kHz MAS frequency; (2) limited temperature increase inside the MACS insert of only 5 °C at 5 kHz MAS frequency in an 11.74 T magnetic field, rendering MACS suitable to study live biological samples. The wafer-scale fabrication process yields MACS inserts with reproducible properties, readily available to be used on a large scale in bio-chemistry labs. To illustrate the potential of these devices for metabolomic studies, we further report on: (3) ultra-fine 1H-1H and 13C-13C J-couplings resolved within 10 min for a 340 mM uniformly 13C-labeled glucose sample; and (4) single zebrafish embryo measurements through 1H-1H COSY within 4.5 h, opening the gate for the single embryo NMR studies. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Identification of pathways that regulate circadian rhythms using a larval zebrafish small molecule screen
AB  - The circadian clock ensures that behavioral and physiological processes occur at appropriate times during the 24-hour day/night cycle, and is regulated at both the cellular and organismal levels. To identify pathways acting on intact animals, we performed a small molecule screen using a luminescent reporter of molecular circadian rhythms in zebrafish larvae. We identified both known and novel pathways that affect circadian period, amplitude and phase. Several drugs identified in the screen did not affect circadian rhythms in cultured cells derived from luminescent reporter embryos or in established zebrafish and mammalian cell lines, suggesting they act via mechanisms absent in cell culture. Strikingly, using drugs that promote or inhibit inflammation, as well as a mutant that lacks microglia, we found that inflammatory state affects circadian amplitude. These results demonstrate a benefit of performing drug screens using intact animals and provide novel targets for treating circadian rhythm disorders. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - A zebrafish drug screening platform boosts the discovery of novel therapeutics for spinal cord injury in mammals
AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex condition, with limited therapeutic options, that results in sensory and motor disabilities. To boost discovery of novel therapeutics, we designed a simple and efficient drug screening platform. This innovative approach allows to determine locomotor rescue properties of small molecules in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) larval spinal cord transection model. We validated our screening platform by showing that Riluzole and Minocycline, two molecules that are in clinical trials for SCI, promote rescue of the locomotor function of the transected larvae. Further validation of the platform was obtained through the blind identification of D-Cycloserine, a molecule scheduled to enter phase IV clinical trials for SCI. Importantly, we identified Tranexamic acid and further showed that this molecule maintains its locomotor recovery properties in a rodent female contusion model. Our screening platform, combined with drug repurposing, promises to propel the rapid translation of novel therapeutics to improve SCI recovery in humans. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Sensitization and synergistic anti-cancer effects of Furanodiene identified in zebrafish models
AB  - Furanodiene is a natural terpenoid isolated from Rhizoma Curcumae, a well-known Chinese medicinal herb that presents anticancer effects in various types of cancer cell lines. In this study, we have successfully established zebrafish xenografts with 5 various human cancer cell lines; and validated these models with anti-cancer drugs used clinically for treating human cancer patients. We found that Furanodiene was therapeutically effective for human JF 305 pancreatic cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells xenotranplanted into zebrafish. Furanodiene showed a markedly synergistic anti-cancer effect when used in combination with 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil) for both human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and human liver cancer BEL-7402 cells xenotransplanted into zebrafish. Unexpectedly, Furanodiene reversed multiple drug resistance in the zebrafish xenotransplanted with cis-Platinum-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cells and Adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells. Furanodiene played its anti-cancer effects through anti-angiogenesis and inducing ROS production, DNA strand breaks and apoptosis. Furanodiene suppresseed efflux transporter Pgp (P-glycoprotein) function and reduced Pgp protein level, but no effect on Pgp related gene (MDR1) expression. These results suggest sensitizition and synergistic anti-cancer effects of Furanodiene that is worthy of a further investigation. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Corosolic acid isolated from Eriobotrya japonica leaves reduces glucose level in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, zebrafish and rats
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with high morbidity and mortality is characterized by abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism due in part to insulin resistance in liver, which lead to elevated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. This study sough to explore the effects of corosolic acid (CA) in different T2D models and explored the underlying mechanism. Separated from Eriobotrya japonica leaves, CA purity was above 95% measured by a HPLC method. Compared with cAMP and DEX induced T2D HepG2 model, CA significantly stimulated glucose consumption and improved glycogen accumulation by inhibiting PEPCK mRNA expression. And in cAMP and DEX induced T2D zebrafish model, CA reduced glycogen degradation and increased glucose consumption by regulating some key enzymes in carbon metabolism including GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, LDHA, LDHB, GP, G6Pase, GYS1, and PFKFB3. In addition, insulin receptor signals were also involved in CA-regulated hypoglycemic action. Furthermore, in STZ-induced T2D rat model, compared with diabetic control groups, CA remarkably downregulated the levels of serum lipid, blood glucose, ICAM-1, malonaldehyde and insulin resistance index, while upregulated SOD activity and impaired glucose tolerance. In a conclusion, CA can regulate glucose and lipid metabolic adaptation in T2D like HepG2, zebrafish and rat models partly through reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and suppressing PEPCK. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Impact of post-hatching maturation on the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol in zebrafish larvae
AB  - Zebrafish larvae are increasingly used in pharmacological and toxicological studies, but it is often overlooked that internal exposure to exogenous compounds, rather than the incubation medium concentration, is driving observed effects. Moreover, as the zebrafish larva is a developing organism, continuous physiological changes impact pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic processes like the absorption and elimination of exogenous compounds, influencing the interpretation of observations and conclusions drawn from experiments at different larval ages. Here, using paracetamol as paradigm compound, mathematical modelling is used to quantify absorption and elimination rates from internal exposure over time profiles after waterborne treatment, as well as changes in these parameters in post-hatching larvae of 3, 4, and 5 days post fertilisation (dpf). An increase of 106% in absorption rate was observed between 3 and 4 dpf, but no further increase at 5 dpf, and an increase of 17.5% in elimination rate for each dpf. Paracetamol clearance, determined from elimination rate constants and reported total larval volumes of 253, 263, and 300 nL at 3, 4, and 5 dpf respectively, correlates best with higher vertebrates at 5 dpf. This suggests that when studying direct effects of exogenous compounds, experiments with zebrafish larvae are best performed at 5 dpf. © 2019, The Author(s).

Given so many choices, users must understand the limitations of each available model. They also need to appreciate the best use of each, so they can decide which system serves their needs. We wrote this chapter with these practicalities and the working scientist in mind. We do not give an exhaustive overview. Instead, we describe the most commonly used skin models and focus on the key properties of each. We also discuss their most appropriate use, illustrated with practical examples.

TI  - Systemic toxicity reported for CDK8/19 inhibitors CCT251921 and MSC2530818 is not due to target inhibition
AB  - CDK8/19 kinases, which mediate transcriptional reprogramming, have become an active target for cancer drug discovery. Several small-molecule CDK8/19 inhibitors showed in vivo efficacy and two have entered clinical trials, with no significant toxicities reported. However, Clarke et al. (eLife 2016; 5; e20722) found severe systemic toxicity associated with two potent CDK8/19 inhibitors, Cmpd3 (CCT251921) and Cmpd4 (MSC2530818), and suggested that their toxicity was due to on-target effects. Here, we compared five CDK8/19 inhibitors: Cmpd3, Cmpd4, Senexin B, 16-didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) and 15w, in different assays. Only Cmpd4 showed striking toxicity in developing zebrafish. In cell-based assays for CDK8 and CDK19 inhibition, Cmpd3, Cmpd4, dCA and 15w showed similar low-nanomolar potency and efficacy against CDK8 and CDK19, while Senexin B was less potent. Only dCA produced sustained inhibition of CDK8/19-dependent gene expression. While toxicity of different compounds did not correlate with their effects on CDK8 and CDK19, kinome profiling identified several off-target kinases for both Cmpd3 and Cmpd4, which could be responsible for their toxicity. Off-target activities could have been achieved in the study of Clarke et al. due to high in vivo doses of Cmpd3 and Cmpd4, chosen for the ability to inhibit STAT1 S727 phosphorylation in tumor xenografts. We show here that STAT1 S727 phosphorylation is induced by various cytokines and stress stimuli in CDK8/19-independent manner, indicating that it is not a reliable pharmacodynamic marker of CDK8/19 activity. These results illustrate the need for careful off-target analysis and dose selection in the development of CDK8/19 inhibitors. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Zebrafish as a preclinical in vivo screening model for nanomedicines
AB  - The interactions of nanomedicines with biological environments is heavily influenced by their physicochemical properties. Formulation design and optimization are therefore key steps towards successful nanomedicine development. Unfortunately, detailed assessment of nanomedicine formulations, at a macromolecular level, in rodents is severely limited by the restricted imaging possibilities within these animals. Moreover, rodent in vivo studies are time consuming and expensive, limiting the number of formulations that can be practically assessed in any one study. Consequently, screening and optimisation of nanomedicine formulations is most commonly performed in surrogate biological model systems, such as human-derived cell cultures. However, despite the time and cost advantages of classical in vitro models, these artificial systems fail to reflect and mimic the complex biological situation a nanomedicine will encounter in vivo. This has acutely hampered the selection of potentially successful nanomedicines for subsequent rodent in vivo studies. Recently, zebrafish have emerged as a promising in vivo model, within nanomedicine development pipelines, by offering opportunities to quickly screen nanomedicines under in vivo conditions and in a cost-effective manner so as to bridge the current gap between in vitro and rodent studies. In this review, we outline several advantageous features of the zebrafish model, such as biological conservation, imaging modalities, availability of genetic tools and disease models, as well as their various applications in nanomedicine development. Critical experimental parameters are discussed and the most beneficial applications of the zebrafish model, in the context of nanomedicine development, are highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sublethal antibiotics collapse gut bacterial populations by enhancing aggregation and expulsion
AB  - Antibiotics induce large and highly variable changes in the intestinal microbiome even at sublethal concentrations, through mechanisms that remain elusive. Using gnotobiotic zebrafish, which allow high-resolution examination of microbial dynamics, we found that sublethal doses of the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin cause severe drops in bacterial abundance. Contrary to conventional views of antimicrobial tolerance, disruption was more pronounced for slow-growing, aggregated bacteria than for fast-growing, planktonic species. Live imaging revealed that antibiotic treatment promoted bacterial aggregation and increased susceptibility to intestinal expulsion. Intestinal mechanics therefore amplify the effects of antibiotics on resident bacteria. Microbial dynamics are captured by a biophysical model that connects antibiotic-induced collapses to gelation phase transitions in soft materials, providing a framework for predicting the impact of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Cholinesterase Inhibitory Arisugacins L-Q from a Penicillium sp. Isolate Obtained through a Citizen Science Initiative and Their Activities in a Phenotype-Based Zebrafish Assay
AB  - Phenotype-based screening of a fungal extract library yielded an active sample from a Penicillium sp. isolate that impaired zebrafish motility. Bioassay-guided purification led to the identification of 14 meroterpenoids including six new metabolites, arisugacins L-Q (4, 5, 8, and 12-14), seven known arisugacins (1-3, 6, 7, 9, and 10), and one known terreulactone (11). Their structures were determined using a combination of NMR and HRESIMS data, evidence secured from theoretical and experimental ECD spectra, and the modified Mosher's method. The purified compounds were tested in zebrafish embryos, as well as in vitro for cholinesterase inhibition activities. Compound 12 produced defects in myotome structure (metameric muscle, which is critical for locomotion) in vivo and showed the most potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 191 nM in vitro. The phenotype assay was also used to reveal bioactivities for several previously reported arisugacins, which had failed to show activity in prior cell-based and in vitro testing. This study demonstrates that utilization of the zebrafish phenotype assay is an effective approach for the identification of bioactive extracts, is compatible with the bioassay-guided compound purification strategies, and offers a valuable tool for probing complex natural product sources to detect bioactive small molecules with potential therapeutic or other commercial applications.

TI  - Insights from zebrafish deficiency models to understand the impact of local thyroid hormone regulator action on early development
AB  - Thyroid hormones (THs) stimulate and coordinate a wide range of processes to ensure normal development, mainly by binding of the most active TH 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) to nuclear receptors resulting in changes in gene transcription. Local TH action is monitored at three distinct levels by different types of regulators: transmembrane transporters (TH influx and efflux), deiodinases (TH activation and inactivation) and nuclear receptors (TH signalling). Since TH regulators are strongly conserved among vertebrate species, the externally and rapidly developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become one of the favourite models to study their role in TH-dependent development. Most regulators are expressed in zebrafish from early stages in development in a dynamic and tissue-specific pattern. Transient or permanent disruption of a given regulator severely perturbs development of multiple organs. These zebrafish deficiency models help to explain why, next to overall hypo-/hyperthyroidism, inactivating mutations in the genes encoding TH regulators such as MCT8 and THRA/B have irreversible adverse effects on human development. Zebrafish are also increasingly used as a high-throughput model to assess the toxicity of various xenobiotics and their impact on development. While adverse effects on TH metabolism and gene expression have been shown, information on direct interaction with TH regulators is scarce, albeit essential to fully understand their mechanism of action. For the future, the combination of novel gene silencing tools, fluorescent reporter lines and (single-cell) transcriptomics holds promise for new zebrafish models to further elucidate the role of each TH regulator in vertebrate development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Do Zebrafish Obey Lipinski Rules?
AB  - The use of zebrafish in whole organism phenotypic assays has become a valuable strategy throughout the drug discovery process. Zebrafish assays can be used not only to screen libraries of compounds at the earliest stages but also to evaluate advanced leads for their effects on specific biological pathways or for toxicity. However, when confronted with inactivity of a compound in a zebrafish assay, there are little data that can be used to judge if the compound is truly biologically inert or inactive due to a lack of permeability into the model organism. While medicinal chemistry principles suggest parameters that are predictive of human oral bioavailability, cellular permeability, and even bacterial permeability, there have been no such parameters developed for zebrafish absorption. To address this question, we compiled a set of 700 compounds reported in the literature to be active in zebrafish assays, evaluated their properties, and compared them to properties derived from a set of historical drugs and a set of recently approved oral drugs. While some properties overlap, the averages and 10th and 90th percentiles of molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient (logP), H-bond counts, and polar surface area for zebrafish-active compounds are statistically different from those of known drugs. This analysis should be useful to scientists interpreting structure-activity relationships based on data from zebrafish assays and help to inform the translation from fish to mammals. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Towards high-throughput chemobehavioural phenomics in neuropsychiatric drug discovery
AB  - Identifying novel marine-derived neuroactive chemicals with therapeutic potential is diffcult due to inherent complexities of the central nervous system (CNS), our limited understanding of the molecular foundations of neuro-psychiatric conditions, as well as the limited applications of effective high-throughput screening models that recapitulate functionalities of the intact CNS. Furthermore, nearly all neuro-modulating chemicals exhibit poorly characterized pleiotropic activities often referred to as polypharmacology. The latter renders conventional target-based in vitro screening approaches very difficult to accomplish. In this context, chemobehavioural phenotyping using innovative small organism models such as planarians and zebrafish represent powerful and highly integrative approaches to study the impact of new chemicals on central and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast to in vitro bioassays aimed predominantly at identification of chemicals acting on single targets, phenotypic chemobehavioural analysis allows for complex multi-target interactions to occur in combination with studies of polypharmacological effects of chemicals in a context of functional and intact milieu of the whole organism. In this review, we will outline recent advances in high-throughput chemobehavioural phenotyping and provide a future outlook on how those innovative methods can be utilized for rapidly screening and characterizing marine-derived compounds with prospective applications in neuropharmacology and psychosomatic medicine. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Altered Swimming Behaviors in Zebrafish Larvae Lacking Cannabinoid Receptor 2
AB  - Background and Objectives: The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) was previously implicated in brain functions, including complex behaviors. Here, we assessed the role of CB2 in selected swimming behaviors in zebrafish larvae and developed an in vivo upscalable whole-organism approach for CB2 ligand screening. Experimental Approach: Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generated a novel null allele (cnr2upr1) and a stable homozygote-viable loss-of-function (CB2-KO) line. We measured in untreated wild-Type and cnr2upr1/upr1 larvae, photo-dependent (swimming) responses (PDR) and center occupancy (CO) to establish quantifiable anxiety-like parameters. Next, we measured PDR alteration and CO variation while exposing wild-Type and mutant animals to an anxiolytic drug (valproic acid [VPA]) or to an anxiogenic drug (pentylenetetrazol [PTZ]). Finally, we treated wild-Type and mutant larvae with two CB2-specific agonists (JWH-133 and HU-308) and two CB2-specific antagonists, inverse agonists (AM-630 and SR-144528). Results: Untreated CB2-KO showed a different PDR than wild-Type larvae as well as a decreased CO. VPA treatments diminished swimming activity in all animals but to a lesser extend in mutants. CO was strongly diminished and even more in mutants. PTZ-induced inverted PDR was significantly stronger in light and weaker in dark periods and the CO lower in PTZ-Treated mutants. Finally, two of four tested CB2 ligands had a detectable activity in the assay. Conclusions: We showed that larvae lacking CB2 behave differently in complex behaviors that can be assimilated to anxiety-like behaviors. Mutant larvae responded differently to VPA and PTZ treatments, providing in vivo evidence of CB2 modulating complex behaviors. We also established an upscalable combined genetic/behavioral approach in a whole organism that could be further developed for high-Throughput drug discovery platforms. © Agnes Acevedo-Canabal et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2019.

As such, the zebrafish is well suited to in vivo screens, in which thousands of small molecules are tested for their ability to modify disease phenotypes in zebrafish disease models. Numerous approaches have been developed for modeling human diseases in zebrafish, including mutagenesis, transgenesis, pharmacological approaches, wounding, and exposure to infectious or cancerous agents. We review the various strategies for modeling human diseases in zebrafish and discuss important considerations when developing zebrafish models for use in in vivo small molecule screens. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Phenotypic Landscape of Schizophrenia-Associated Genes Defines Candidates and Their Shared Functions
AB  - Genomic studies have identified hundreds of candidate genes near loci associated with risk for schizophrenia. To define candidates and their functions, we mutated zebrafish orthologs of 132 human schizophrenia-associated genes. We created a phenotype atlas consisting of whole-brain activity maps, brain structural differences, and profiles of behavioral abnormalities. Phenotypes were diverse but specific, including altered forebrain development and decreased prepulse inhibition. Exploration of these datasets identified promising candidates in more than 10 gene-rich regions, including the magnesium transporter cnnm2 and the translational repressor gigyf2, and revealed shared anatomical sites of activity differences, including the pallium, hypothalamus, and tectum. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered an essential role for the understudied transcription factor znf536 in the development of forebrain neurons implicated in social behavior and stress. This phenotypic landscape of schizophrenia-associated genes prioritizes more than 30 candidates for further study and provides hypotheses to bridge the divide between genetic association and biological mechanism. Analysis of zebrafish deficient for human schizophrenia-associated genes generates an atlas of brain and behavior phenotypes for the study of psychiatric disorders. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Screening drugs for myocardial disease in vivo with zebrafish: an expert update
AB  - Introduction: Our understanding of the complexity of cardiovascular disease pathophysiology remains very incomplete and has hampered cardiovascular drug development over recent decades. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and their increasing global burden call for novel strategies to address disease biology and drug discovery. Areas covered: This review describes the recent history of cardiovascular drug discovery using in vivo phenotype-based screening in zebrafish. The rationale for the use of this model is highlighted and the initial efforts in the fields of disease modeling and high-throughput screening are illustrated. Finally, the advantages and limitations of in vivo zebrafish screening are discussed, highlighting newer approaches, such as genome editing technologies, to accelerate our understanding of disease biology and the development of precise disease models. Expert opinion: Full understanding and faithful modeling of specific cardiovascular disease is a rate-limiting step for cardiovascular drug discovery. The resurgence of in vivo phenotype screening together with the advancement of systems biology approaches allows for the identification of lead compounds which show efficacy on integrative disease biology in the absence of validated targets. This strategy bypasses current gaps in knowledge of disease biology and paves the way for successful drug discovery and downstream molecular target identification. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - A smart imaging workflow for organ-specific screening in a cystic kidney Zebrafish disease model
AB  - The zebrafish is being increasingly used in biomedical research and drug discovery to conduct large-scale compound screening. However, there is a lack of accessible methodologies to enable automated imaging and scoring of tissue-specific phenotypes at enhanced resolution. Here, we present the development of an automated imaging pipeline to identify chemical modifiers of glomerular cyst formation in a zebrafish model for human cystic kidney disease. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein Ift172 in Tg(wt1b:EGFP) embryos was used to induce large glomerular cysts representing a robustly scorable phenotypic readout. Compound-treated embryos were consistently aligned within the cavities of agarose-filled microplates. By interfacing feature detection algorithms with automated microscopy, a smart imaging workflow for detection, centring and zooming in on regions of interests was established, which enabled the automated capturing of standardised higher resolution datasets of pronephric areas. High-content screening datasets were processed and analysed using custom-developed heuristic algorithms implemented in common open-source image analysis software. The workflow enables highly efficient profiling of entire compound libraries and scoring of kidney-specific morphological phenotypes in thousands of zebrafish embryos. The demonstrated toolset covers all the aspects of a complex whole organism screening assay and can be adapted to other organs, specimens or applications. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Developmental Regulation of Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2 Related Factors (nrfs) by AHR1b in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Interactions between regulatory pathways allow organisms to adapt to their environment and respond to stress. One interaction that has been recently identified occurs between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor (NRF) family. Each transcription factor regulates numerous downstream genes involved in the cellular response to toxicants and oxidative stress; they are also implicated in normal developmental pathways. The zebrafish model was used to explore the role of AHR regulation of nrf genes during development and in response to toxicant exposure. To determine if AHR1b is responsible for transcriptional regulation of 6 nrf genes during development, a loss-of-function experiment using morpholino-modified oligonucleotides was conducted followed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation study at the beginning of the pharyngula period (24 h postfertilization). The expression of nrf1a was AHR1b dependent and its expression was directly regulated through specific XREs in its cis-promoter. However, nrf1a expression was not altered by exposure to 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a toxicant and prototypic AHR agonist. The expression of nrf1b, nrf2a, and nfe2 was induced by TCDD, and AHR1b directly regulated their expression by binding to cis-XRE promoter elements. Last, nrf2b and nrf3 were neither induced by TCDD nor regulated by AHR1b. These results show that AHR1b transcriptionally regulates nrf genes under toxicant modulation via binding to specific XREs. These data provide a better understanding of how combinatorial molecular signaling potentially protects embryos from embryotoxic events following toxicant exposure. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - An FDA-Approved drug screen for compounds influencing craniofacial skeletal development and craniosynostosis
AB  - Neural crest stem/progenitor cells (NCSCs) populate a variety of tissues, and their dysregulation is implicated in several human diseases including craniosynostosis and neuroblastoma. We hypothesised that small molecules that inhibit NCSC induction or differentiation may represent potential therapeutically relevant drugs in these disorders. We screened 640 FDA-approved compounds currently in clinical use for other conditions to identify those which disrupt development of NCSC-derived skeletal elements that form the zebrafish jaw. In the primary screen, we used heterozygous transgenic sox10:gfp zebrafish to directly visualise NCSC-derived jaw cartilage. We noted partial toxicity of this transgene in relation to jaw patterning, suggesting that our primary screen was sensitised for NCSC defects, and we confirmed 10 novel, 4 previously reported, and 2 functional analogue drug hits in wild-type embryos. Of these drugs, 9/14 and 7/14, respectively, are known to target pathways implicated in osteoarthritis pathogenesis or to cause reduced bone mineral density/increased fracture risk as side effects in patients treated for other conditions, suggesting that our screen enriched for pathways targeting skeletal tissue homeostasis. We selected one drug that inhibited NCSC induction and one drug that inhibits bone mineralisation for further detailed analyses which reflect our initial hypotheses. These drugs were leflunomide and cyclosporin A, respectively, and their functional analogues, teriflunomide and FK506 (tacrolimus). We identified their critical developmental windows of activity, showing that the severity of defects observed related to the timing, duration, and dose of treatment. While leflunomide has previously been shown to inhibit NCSC induction, we demonstrate additional later roles in cartilage remodelling. Both drugs altered expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases. As proof-of-concept, we also tested drug treatment of disease-relevant mammalian cells. While leflunomide treatment inhibited the viability of several human NCSC-derived neuroblastoma cell lines coincident with altered expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and transcription, FK506 enhanced murine calvarial osteoblast differentiation and prevented fusion of the coronal suture in calvarial explants taken from Crouzon syndrome mice. © 2018 S.

TI  - Oleanolic acid promotes orofacial antinociception in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) through TRPV1 receptors
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of oleanolic acid using adult zebrafish models of orofacial pain. Acute nociception was induced by formalin, capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, menthol, acidified saline or glutamate (cutaneous modes) and hypertonic saline (corneal model). In another set of experiments, animals were pre-treated with naloxone, L-NAME, methylene blue, ketamine, camphor, HC-030031, mefenamic acid, ruthenium red or amiloride to investigate the mechanism of antinociception. The involvement of central afferent C-fibers was also investigated. A molecular docking was performed using the TRPV1 channel. Motor activity was evaluated with the open field test. Pre-treatment with oleanolic acid significantly reduced nociceptive behavior associated with acute pain. Antinociception was effectively inhibited by ruthenium red and capsaicin-induced desensitization. Presence of trpv1 was confirmed by RT-PCR in cerebral tissue of zebrafish. In line with in vivo experiments, docking studies indicated that oleanolic acid may interact with TRPV1. Results confirm the potential pharmacological relevance of oleanolic acid as an inhibitor of orofacial nociception mediated by TRPV1. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Role of β-glucosidase 2 in aberrant glycosphingolipid metabolism: Model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency in zebrafish
AB  - β-glucosidases [GBA1 (glucocerebrosidase) and GBA2] are ubiquitous essential enzymes. Lysosomal GBA1 and cytosol-facing GBA2 degrade glucosylceramide (GlcCer); GBA1 deficiency causes Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by lysosomal accumulation of GlcCer, which is partly converted to glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). GBA1 and GBA2 also may transfer glucose from GlcCer to cholesterol, yielding glucosylated cholesterol (GlcChol). Here, we aimed to clarify the role of zebrafish Gba2 in glycosphingolipid metabolism during Gba1 deficiency in zebrafish (Danio rerio), which are able to survive total Gba1 deficiency. We developed Gba1 (gba1-/-), Gba2 (gba2-/-), and double (gba1-/-:gba2-/-) zebrafish knockouts using CRISPR/Cas9 and explored the effects of both genetic and pharmacological interventions on GlcCer metabolism in individual larvae. Activity-based probes and quantification of relevant glycolipid metabolites confirmed enzyme deficiency. GlcSph increased in gba1-/- larvae (0.09 pmol/fish) but did not increase more in gba1-/-:gba2-/larvae. GlcCer was comparable in gba1-/- and WT larvae but increased in gba2-/- and gba1-/-:gba2-/- larvae. Independent of Gba1 status, GlcChol was low in all gba2-/- larvae (0.05 vs. 0.18 pmol/fish in WT). Pharmacologic inactivation of zebrafish Gba1 comparably increased GlcSph. Inhibition of GlcCer synthase (GCS) in Gba1-deficient larvae reduced GlcCer and GlcSph, and concomitant inhibition of GCS and Gba2 with iminosugars also reduced excessive GlcChol. Finally, overexpression of human GBA1 and injection of recombinant GBA1 both decreased GlcSph. We determined that zebrafish larvae offer an attractive model to study glucosidase actions in glycosphingolipid metabolism in vivo, and we identified distinguishing characteristics of zebrafish Gba2 deficiency.

AB  - Nemaline myopathy is a rare neuromuscular disorder that affects 1 in 50,000 live births, with prevalence as high as 1 in 20,000 in certain populations. 13 genes have been linked to nemaline myopathy (NM), all of which are associated with the thin filament of the muscle sarcomere. Of the 13 associated genes, mutations in NEBULIN (NEB) accounts for up to 50% of all cases. Currently, the disease is incompletely understood and there are no available therapeutics for patients. To address this urgent need for effective treatments for patients affected by NM, we conducted a large scale chemical screen in a zebrafish model of NEB-related NM and an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based genetic screen in a mouse model of NEB exon 55 deletion, the most common NEB mutation in NM patients. Neither screen was able to identify a candidate for therapy development, highlighting the need to transition from conventional chemical therapeutics to gene-based therapies for the treatment of NM. © 2019.

TI  - Discovery of Novel Therapeutics for Muscular Dystrophies using Zebrafish Phenotypic Screens
AB  - The recent availability and development of mutant and transgenic zebrafish strains that model human muscular dystrophies has created new research opportunities for therapeutic development. Not only do these models mimic many pathological aspects of human dystrophies, but their small size, large clutch sizes, rapid ex utero development, body transparency, and genetic tractability enable research approaches that would be inconceivable with mammalian model systems. Here we discuss the use of zebrafish models of muscular dystrophy to rapidly screen hundreds to thousands of bioactive compounds in order to identify novel therapeutic candidates that modulate pathologic phenotypes. We review the justification and rationale behind this unbiased approach, including how zebrafish screens have identified FDA-approved drugs that are candidates for treating Duchenne and limb girdle muscular dystrophies. Not only can these drugs be re-purposed for treating dystrophies in a fraction of the time and cost of new drug development, but their identification has revealed novel, unexpected directions for future therapy development. Phenotype-driven zebrafish drug screens are an important compliment to the more established mammalian, target-based approaches for rapidly developing and validating therapeutics for muscular dystrophies. © 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

TI  - The zebrafish subcortical social brain as a model for studying social behavior disorders
AB  - Social behaviors are essential for the survival and reproduction of social species. Many, if not most, neuropsychiatric disorders in humans are either associated with underlying social deficits or are accompanied by social dysfunctions. Traditionally, rodent models have been used to model these behavioral impairments. However, rodent assays are often difficult to scale up and adapt to high-throughput formats, which severely limits their use for systems-level science. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have used zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system to study social behavior. These studies have demonstrated clear potential in overcoming some of the limitations of rodent models. In this Review, we explore the evolutionary conservation of a subcortical social brain between teleosts and mammals as the biological basis for using zebrafish to model human social behavior disorders, while summarizing relevant experimental tools and assays. We then discuss the recent advances gleaned from zebrafish social behavior assays, the applications of these assays to studying related disorders, and the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. © 2019.

TI  - Orthogonal drug pooling enhances phenotype-based discovery of ocular antiangiogenic drugs in zebrafish larvae
AB  - Unbiased screening of large randomized chemical libraries in vivo is a powerful tool to find new drugs and targets. However, forward chemical screens in zebrafish can be time consuming and usually &gt;99% of test compounds have no significant effect on the desired phenotype. Here, we sought to find bioactive drugs more efficiently and to comply with the 3R principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement of animals in research. We investigated if pooling of drugs to simultaneously test 8-10 compounds in zebrafish larvae can increase the screening efficiency of an established assay that identifies drugs inhibiting developmental angiogenesis in the eye. In a phenotype-based screen, we tested 1,760 small molecule compounds from the ChemBridge DIVERSetTM chemical library for their ability to inhibit the formation of distinct primary hyaloid vessels in the eye. Applying orthogonal pooling of the chemical library, we treated zebrafish embryos from 3 to 5 days post fertilization with pools of 8 or 10 compounds at 10 μM each. This reduced the number of tests from 1,760 to 396. In 63% of cases, treatment showed sub-threshold effects of &lt;40% reduction of primary hyaloid vessels. From 18 pool hits, we identified eight compounds that reduce hyaloid vessels in the larval zebrafish eye by at least 40%. Compound 4-[4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)phenoxy]aniline ranked as the most promising candidate with reproducible and dose-dependent effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a self-deconvoluting matrix strategy applied to drug screening in zebrafish. We conclude that the orthogonal drug pooling strategy is a cost-effective, time-saving, and unbiased approach to discover novel inhibitors of developmental angiogenesis in the eye. Ultimately, this approach may identify new drugs or targets to mitigate disease caused by pathological angiogenesis in the eye, e.g., diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, wherein blood vessel growth and leaky vessels lead to vision impairment or clinical blindness. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

TI  - There Is Something Fishy About Liver Cancer: Zebrafish Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
AB  - The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the mortality resulting from HCC are both increasing. Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at advanced stages when curative treatments are impossible. Current drug therapy extends mean overall survival by only a short period of time. Genetic mutations associated with HCC vary widely. Therefore, transgenic and mutant animal models are needed to investigate the molecular effects of specific mutations, classify them as drivers or passengers, and develop targeted treatments. Cirrhosis, however, is the premalignant state common to 90% of HCC patients. Currently, no specific therapies are available to halt or reverse the progression of cirrhosis to HCC. Understanding the genetic drivers of HCC as well as the biochemical, mechanical, hormonal, and metabolic changes associated with cirrhosis could lead to novel treatments and cancer prevention strategies. Although additional therapies recently received Food and Drug Administration approval, significant clinical breakthroughs have not emerged since the introduction of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, necessitating alternate research strategies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are effective for disease modeling because of their high degree of gene and organ architecture conservation with human beings, ease of transgenesis and mutagenesis, high fecundity, and low housing cost. Here, we review zebrafish models of HCC and identify areas on which to focus future research efforts to maximize the advantages of the zebrafish model system. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Zebrafish as a tool to assess developmental neurotoxicity
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emerging biological model system in toxicological studies. The zebrafish is used to fill the gap between various in vitro and mammalian models currently being used to identify mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity. The high-throughput characteristics that contribute to the strength of this small animal model combined with novel and/or standardized high-throughput technology can be used by researchers to conduct a robust volume of developmental embryonic and larval neurotoxicity assays. Using analytical toxicological methods, dose-response-time relationships can be established for comparison to other research animal model systems and translation to humans. Toxicogenomic and targeted molecular evaluations of xenobiotics can be used to identify pathways of toxicity and linked with phenotypic and behavioral insults to define mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity using wild-type or transgenic zebrafish. This chapter describes analytical approaches for examining toxicokinetics of xenobiotics in the developing zebrafish, imaging techniques being used to identify phenotypic neurological abnormalities, behavioral assays in embryonic and larval zebrafish, and targeted and -omic approaches to identify molecular targets and pathways of neurotoxicity for an integrated approach to investigate developmental neurotoxicity using the zebrafish model system. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019.

TI  - Application of benchmark concentration (BMC) analysis on zebrafish data: A new perspective for quantifying toxicity in alternative animal models
AB  - Over the past decade, the zebrafish is increasingly being used as a model to screen for chemical-mediated toxicities including developmental toxicity (DT) and neurotoxicity (NT). One of the major challenges is lack of harmonization in data analysis approaches, thereby posing difficulty in comparing findings across laboratories. To address this, we sought to establish a unified data analysis strategy for both DT and NT data, by adopting the benchmark concentration (BMC) analysis. There are two critical aspects in the BMC analysis: having a toxicity endpoint amenable for BMC and selecting a proper benchmark response (BMR) for the endpoint. For the former, in addition to the typical endpoints in NT assay (eg, hyper/hypo- response quantified by distance moved), we also used endpoints that assess the differences in movement patterns between chemical-treated embryos and control embryos. For the latter, we standardized the selection of BMR, which is analogous to minimum activity threshold, based on intrinsic response variations in the endpoint. When comparing our BMC results with a traditionally used LOAEL method (lowest-observed-adverse-effect level), we found high active compound concordance (100% for DT vs 74% for NT); generally, the BMC was more sensitive than LOAEL (no. of BMC more sensitive/no. of concordant active compounds, 43/50 for DT vs 16/26 for NT). Using the BMC with standardized toxicity endpoints and an appropriate BMR, we may now have a unified data-analysis approach to comparing results across different zebrafish datasets, for a better understanding of strengths and challenges when using the zebrafish as a screening tool. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology 2018.

TI  - Heart and liver regeneration in zebrafish using silver nanoparticle synthesized from Turbinaria conoides – In vivo
AB  - The present study was aimed to identify the heart and liver regeneration in zebrafish using biosynthesised silver nanoparticles from Turbinaria conoides. This work focussed on the bioactivity of AgNP when incorporated into the zebrafish (Danio rerio) system. We began investigating the in vivo assays: Hepatocyte viability staining after H2O2 treatment, cardiomyocyte response to Ca++, cardio vascular heart rate activity by measuring hypertrophy, cardio vascular pathology and cardio vascular regeneration, liver regeneration and liver pathology, molecular pathway target identification and hypothesis on interacting domain (AgNO3) of the vertebrate model organism. The FTIR results of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles from Turbinaria conoides showed prominent peaks (range between 620.967 and 2854.14). Further, the results of XRD analysis showed the 2γ intense values (38.11 and 70.57) within the ranges of Bragg's reflection. In addition, the SEM analysis determined the size of nanoparticle (50–100 nm). It can be concluded from the present findings that, the biosynthesised silver nanoparticles from the seaweed extract of Turbinaria conoides can be used as potential cardioprotective and liver protective agent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The power of fish models to elucidate skin cancer pathogenesis and impact the discovery of new therapeutic opportunities
AB  - Animal models play important roles in investigating the pathobiology of cancer, identifying relevant pathways, and developing novel therapeutic tools. Despite rapid progress in the understanding of disease mechanisms and technological advancement in drug discovery, negative trial outcomes are the most frequent incidences during a Phase III trial. Skin cancer is a potential life-threatening disease in humans and might be medically futile when tumors metastasize. This explains the low success rate of melanoma therapy amongst other malignancies. In the past decades, a number of skin cancer models in fish that showed a parallel development to the disease in humans have provided important insights into the fundamental biology of skin cancer and future treatment methods. With the diversity and breadth of advanced molecular genetic tools available in fish biology, fish skin cancer models will continue to be refined and expanded to keep pace with the rapid development of skin cancer research. This review begins with a brief introduction of molecular characteristics of skin cancers, followed by an overview of teleost models that have been used in the last decades in melanoma research. Next, we will detail the importance of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) animal model and other emerging fish models including platyfish (Xiphophorus sp.), and medaka (Oryzias latipes) in future cutaneous malignancy studies. The last part of this review provides the recent development and genome editing applications of skin cancer models in zebrafish and the progressmall molecule screening. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Nux Vomica Exposure Triggered Liver Injury and Metabolic Disturbance in Zebrafish Larvae
AB  - Zebrafish larvae were used to further understand the liver toxicity of nux vomica. The histopathology, protein expression, and gene expression were assessed to confirm apoptosis in the liver, and then, profiles of the metabolites in zebrafish were investigated by untargeted metabolomic assessment to understand the potential toxicity mechanism of nux vomica. Histopathological observations showed that nux vomica caused damage to liver cells. Western blot results indicated increased expression of activated caspase3, and the result of real-time polymerase chain reaction showed a significant increase in the expression level of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 genes (p < 0.05) compared with the control group. The liver injury from nux vomica was linked to the downregulation of amino acid (e.g., proline and alanine) and fatty acid (e.g., palmitoleic acid) metabolism and upregulation of some other fatty acid (e.g., arachidic acid) and purine (e.g., xanthine and uric acid) metabolism. The hepatotoxicity of nux vomica resulted from metabolic pathway disturbances, including small molecules involved in energy, purine, lipids, and amino acid metabolism. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.

TI  - Geraniol and linalool anticandidal activity, genotoxic potential and embryotoxic effect on zebrafish
AB  - Aim: Geraniol and linalool are major constituents of the essential oils of medicinal plants. Materials &amp; methods: Antifungal activity of geraniol and linalool were evaluated against five Candida species. The genotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test, and the embryotoxic assays use zebrafish model. Results: Geraniol and linalool inhibited Candida growth, but geraniol was more effective. The geraniol at concentration of 800 μg/ml and the linalool at concentration of 125 μg/ml significantly increased chromosome damage. Geraniol was more toxic to zebrafish embryo than linalool: LC 50 values were 31.3 and 193.3 μg/ml, respectively. Conclusion: Geraniol and linalool have anticandidal activity, but they also exert genotoxic and embryotoxic effects at the highest tested concentrations. © 2018 2018 Future Medicine Ltd.

TI  - Whole-organism chemical screening identifies modulators of pancreatic B-cell function
AB  - b-Cell loss and dysfunction play a critical role in the progression of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Identifying new molecules and/or molecular pathways that improve b-cell function and/or increase b-cell mass should significantly contribute to the development of new therapies for diabetes. Using the zebrafish model, we screened 4,640 small molecules to identify modulators of b-cell function. This in vivo strategy identified 84 stimulators of insulin expression, which simultaneously reduced glucose levels. The insulin promoter activation kinetics for 32 of these stimulators were consistent with a direct mode of action. A subset of insulin stimulators, including the antidiabetic drug pioglitazone, induced the coordinated upregulation of gluconeogenic pck1 expression, suggesting functional response to increased insulin action in peripheral tissues. Notably, Kv1.3 inhibitors increased b-cell mass in larval zebrafish and stimulated b-cell function in adult zebrafish and in the streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mouse model. In addition, our data indicate that cytoplasmic Kv1.3 regulates b-cell function. Thus, using whole-organism screening, we have identified new small-molecule modulators of b-cell function and glucose metabolism. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

TI  - Morphometric analysis and neuroanatomical mapping of the zebrafish brain
AB  - Large-scale genomic studies have recently identified genetic variants causative for major neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and autism. However, determining how underlying developmental processes are affected by these mutations remains a significant challenge in the field. Zebrafish is an established model system in developmental neurogenetics that may be useful in uncovering the mechanisms of these mutations. Here we describe the use of voxel-intensity, deformation field, and volume-based morphometric techniques for the systematic and unbiased analysis of gene knock-down and environmental exposure-induced phenotypes in zebrafish. We first present a computational method for brain segmentation based on transgene expression patterns to create a comprehensive neuroanatomical map. This map allowed us to disclose statistically significant changes in brain microstructure and composition in neurodevelopmental models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of morphometric techniques in measuring changes in the relative size of neuroanatomical subdivisions in atoh7 morphant larvae and in identifying phenotypes in larvae treated with valproic acid, a chemical demonstrated to increase the risk of autism in humans. These tools enable rigorous evaluation of the effects of gene mutations and environmental exposures on neural development, providing an entry point for cellular and molecular analysis of basic developmental processes as well as neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. © 2018

TI  - In Vivo Selectivity and Localization of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Induction by Osmium Anticancer Complexes That Circumvent Platinum Resistance
AB  - Platinum drugs are widely used for cancer treatment. Other precious metals are promising, but their clinical progress depends on achieving different mechanisms of action to overcome Pt-resistance. Here, we evaluate 13 organo-Os complexes: 16-electron sulfonyl-diamine catalysts [(η6-arene)Os(N,N′)], and 18-electron phenylazopyridine complexes [(η6-arene)Os(N,N')Cl/I]+ (arene = p-cymene, biphenyl, or terphenyl). Their antiproliferative activity does not depend on p21 or p53 status, unlike cisplatin, and their selective potency toward cancer cells involves the generation of reactive oxygen species. Evidence of such a mechanism of action has been found both in vitro and in vivo. This work appears to provide the first study of osmium complexes in the zebrafish model, which has been shown to closely model toxicity in humans. A fluorescent osmium complex, derived from a lead compound, was employed to confirm internalization of the complex, visualize in vivo distribution, and confirm colocalization with reactive oxygen species generated in zebrafish.

TI  - Bloody zebrafish: Novel methods in normal and malignant hematopoiesis
AB  - Hematopoiesis is an optimal system for studying stem cell maintenance and lineage differentiation under physiological and pathological conditions. In vertebrate organisms, billions of differentiated hematopoietic cells need to be continuously produced to replenish the blood cell pool. Disruptions in this process have immediate consequences for oxygen transport, responses against pathogens, maintenance of hemostasis and vascular integrity. Zebrafish is a widely used and well-established model for studying the hematopoietic system. Several new hematopoietic regulators were identified in genetic and chemical screens using the zebrafish model. Moreover, zebrafish enables in vivo imaging of hematopoietic stem cell generation and differentiation during embryogenesis, and adulthood. Finally, zebrafish has been used to model hematopoietic diseases. Recent technological advances in single-cell transcriptome analysis, epigenetic regulation, proteomics, metabolomics, and processing of large data sets promise to transform the current understanding of normal, abnormal, and malignant hematopoiesis. In this perspective, we discuss how the zebrafish model has proven beneficial for studying physiological and pathological hematopoiesis and how these novel technologies are transforming the field. © 2018 de Pater and Trompouki.

TI  - An automated high-resolution in vivo screen in Zebrafish to identify chemical regulators of myelination
AB  - Myelinating oligodendrocytes are essential for central nervous system (CNS) formation and function. Their disruption is implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, recent studies have indicated that oligodendrocytes may be tractable for treatment of disease. In recent years, zebrafish have become well established for the study of myelinating oligodendrocyte biology and drug discovery in vivo. Here, by automating the delivery of zebrafish larvae to a spinning disk confocal microscope, we were able to automate high-resolution imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo. From there, we developed an image analysis pipeline that facilitated a screen of compounds with epigenetic and posttranslational targets for their effects on regulating myelinating oligodendrocyte number. This screen identified novel compounds that strongly promote myelinating oligodendrocyte formation in vivo. Our imaging platform and analysis pipeline is flexible and can be employed for highresolution imaging-based screens of broad interest using zebrafish. © Early et al.

TI  - Elucidating gene-by-environment interactions associated with differential susceptibility to chemical exposure
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern societies are exposed to vast numbers of potentially hazardous chemicals. Despite demonstrated linkages between chemical exposure and severe health effects, there are limited, often conflicting, data on how adverse health effects of exposure differ across individuals. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that population variability in response to certain chemicals could elucidate a role for gene-environment interactions (GxE) in differential susceptibility. METHODS: High-throughput screening (HTS) data on thousands of chemicals in genetically heterogeneous zebrafish were leveraged to identify a candidate chemical (Abamectin) with response patterns indicative of population susceptibility differences. We tested the prediction by generating genome-wide sequence data for 276 individual zebrafish displaying susceptible (Affected) vs. resistant (Unaffected) phenotypes following identical chemical exposure. RESULTS: We found GxE associated with differential susceptibility in the sox7 promoter region and then confirmed gene expression differences between phenotypic response classes. CONCLUSIONS: The results for Abamectin in zebrafish demonstrate that GxE associated with naturally occurring, population genetic variation play a significant role in mediating individual response to chemical exposure. © 2018, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

TI  - Zebrafish as an animal model for drug discovery in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders: A systematic review
AB  - Movement disorders can be primarily divided into hypokinetic and hyperkinetic. Most of the hypokinetic syndromes are associated with the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). By contrast, hyperkinetic syndromes encompass a broader array of diseases, including dystonia, essential tremor, or Huntington's disease. The discovery of effective therapies for these disorders has been challenging and has also involved the development and characterization of accurate animal models for the screening of new drugs. Zebrafish constitutes an alternative vertebrate model for the study of movement disorders. The neuronal circuitries involved in movement in zebrafish are well characterized, and most of the associated molecular mechanisms are highly conserved. Particularly, zebrafish models of PD have contributed to a better understanding of the role of several genes implicated in the disease. Furthermore, zebrafish is a vertebrate model particularly suited for large-scale drug screenings. The relatively small size of zebrafish, optical transparency, and lifecycle, are key characteristics that facilitate the study of multiple compounds at the same time. Several transgenic, knockdown, and mutant zebrafish lines have been generated and characterized. Therefore, it is central to critically analyze these zebrafish lines and understand their suitability as models of movement disorders. Here, we revise the pathogenic mechanisms, phenotypes, and responsiveness to pharmacotherapies of zebrafish lines of the most common movement disorders. A systematic review of the literature was conducted by including all studies reporting the characterization of zebrafish models of the movement disorders selected from five bibliographic databases. A total of 63 studies were analyzed, and the most relevant data within the scope of this review were gathered. The majority (62%) of the studies were focused in the characterization of zebrafish models of PD. Overall, the zebrafish models included display conserved biochemical and neurobehavioral features of the phenomenology in humans. Nevertheless, in light of what is known for all animal models available, the use of zebrafish as a model for drug discovery requires further optimization. Future technological developments alongside with a deeper understanding of the molecular bases of these disorders should enable the development of novel zebrafish lines that can prove useful for drug discovery for movement disorders. © 2018 Vaz, Outeiro and Ferreira.

TI  - Animal models of endocrine disruption
AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are compounds that alter the structure and function of the endocrine system and may be contributing to disorders of the reproductive, metabolic, neuroendocrine and other complex systems. Typically, these outcomes cannot be modeled in cell-based or other simple systems necessitating the use of animal testing. Appropriate animal model selection is required to effectively recapitulate the human experience, including relevant dosing and windows of exposure, and ensure translational utility and reproducibility. While classical toxicology heavily relies on inbred rats and mice, and focuses on apical endpoints such as tumor formation or birth defects, EDC researchers have used a greater diversity of species to effectively model more subtle but significant outcomes such as changes in pubertal timing, mammary gland development, and social behaviors. Advances in genomics, neuroimaging and other tools are making a wider range of animal models more widely available to EDC researchers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Protection of silver nanoparticles using Eysenhardtia polystachya in peroxide-induced pancreatic β-cell damage and their antidiabetic properties in zebrafish
AB  - Background: The aim was to explore the efficacy of extract of Eysenhardtia polystachya-loaded silver nanoparticles (EP/AgNPs) on pancreatic β cells, INS-1 cells, and zebrafish as a valuable model for the study of diabetes mellitus. Materials and methods: EP/AgNPs were synthesized using methanol/water bark extract of E. polystachya and characterized using various physicochemical techniques. Results: Immersion of adult zebrafish in 111 mM glucose solution resulted in a sustained hyperglycemic, hyperlipidemic state, and serum insulin levels decreased. The synthesized EP/AgNPs showed an absorption peak at 413 nm on ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, revealing the surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that most of the particles were spherical, with a diameter of 10–12 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.197, and a zeta potential of -32.25 mV, suggesting high stability of the nanoparticles. EP/AgNPs promote pancreatic β-cell survival, insulin secretion, enhanced hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia in glucose-induced diabetic zebrafish. EP/AgNPs also showed protection of the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury. Conclusion: The results indicate that EP/AgNPs have good antidiabetic activity and therefore could be used to prevent the development of diabetes. © 2018 Garcia Campoy et al.

TI  - Making waves: New developments in toxicology with the zebrafish
AB  - The laboratory zebrafish (Danio rerio) is now an accepted model in toxicologic research. The zebrafish model fills a niche between in vitro models and mammalian biomedical models. The developmental characteristics of the small fish are strategically being used by scientists to study topics ranging from high-throughput toxicity screens to toxicity in multi- and transgenerational studies. High-throughput technology has increased the utility of zebrafish embryonic toxicity assays in screening of chemicals and drugs for toxicity or effect. Additionally, advances in behavioral characterization and experimental methodology allow for observation of recognizable phenotypic changes after xenobiotic exposure. Future directions in zebrafish research are predicted to take advantage of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing methods in creating models of disease and interrogating mechanisms of action with fluorescent reporters or tagged proteins. Zebrafish can also model developmental origins of health and disease and multi and transgenerational toxicity. The zebrafish has many advantages as a toxicologic model and new methodologies and areas of study continue to expand the usefulness and application of the zebrafish. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Identification of circadian clock modulators from existing drugs
AB  - Chronic circadian disruption due to shift work or frequent travel across time zones leads to jet-lag and an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The development of new pharmaceuticals to treat circadian disorders, however, is costly and hugely time-consuming. We therefore performed a high-throughput chemical screen of existing drugs for circadian clock modulators in human U2OS cells, with the aim of repurposing known bioactive compounds. Approximately 5% of the drugs screened altered circadian period, including the period-shortening compound dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; also known as prasterone). DHEA is one of the most abundant circulating steroid hormones in humans and is available as a dietary supplement in the USA. Dietary administration of DHEA to mice shortened free-running circadian period and accelerated re-entrainment to advanced light–dark (LD) cycles, thereby reducing jet-lag. Our drug screen also revealed the involvement of tyrosine kinases, ABL1 and ABL2, and the BCR serine/threonine kinase in regulating circadian period. Thus, drug repurposing is a useful approach to identify new circadian clock modulators and potential therapies for circadian disorders. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Identification of novel melanin synthesis inhibitors from Crataegus pycnoloba using an in vivo zebrafish phenotypic assay
AB  - Zebrafish has emerged as a powerful model organism for high throughput drug screening. Several morphological criteria, transgenic lines and in situ expression screens have been developed to identify novel bioactive compounds and their mechanism of action. Here, we used the inhibition of melanogenesis during early zebrafish embryo development to identify natural compounds that block melanogenesis. We identified an extract from the Greek hawthorn Crataegus pycnoloba as a potent inhibitor of melanin synthesis and used activity based subfractionation to identify active subfractions and eventually three single compounds of the same family (dibenzofurans). These compounds show reversible inhibition of melanin synthesis and do not act via inhibition of tyrosinase. We also showed that they do not interfere with neural crest differentiation or migration. We identified via in silico modeling that the compounds can bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and verified activation of the Ahr signaling pathway showing the induction of the expression of target genes. © 2018 Agalou, Thrapsianiotis, Angelis, Papakyriakou, Skaltsounis, Aligiannis and Beis.

TI  - Multi-modal 3d reconstruction and measurements of zebrafish larvae and its organs using axial-view microscopy
AB  - In life sciences, light microscopy is used to study specimens. On the organism-level a bright-field representation present an overview for the whole shape of a specimen; the organ-level fluorescent staining representation supports in the interpretation of the detailed intrinsic structures. We present light microscopy axial-view imaging based on the Vertebrate Automated Screening Technology to acquire axial-view images for the organism and organs of zebrafish larvae. We obtain multi-modal 3D reconstruction using a profile-based method, from which we can derive the 3D measurements of volume and surface area. In this method, we employ a microscope camera calibration using voxel residual volume maximization algorithm. We intuitively align and fuse the obtained multi-models. Experimental results show natural visualization both for the whole organism and organ of zebrafish larvae; subsequently accurate 3D measurements are obtained. This method is very suitable for high-throughput research in which knowledge on size and shape is relevant to the understanding for development, effects of compounds or drugs. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Gut feelings: Studying enteric nervous system development, function, and disease in the zebrafish model system
AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the largest part of the peripheral nervous system and is entirely neural crest–derived. It provides the intrinsic innervation of the gut, controlling different aspects of gut function, such as motility. In this review, we will discuss key points of Zebrafish ENS development, genes, and signaling pathways regulating ENS development, as well as contributions of the Zebrafish model system to better understand ENS disorders. During their migration, enteric progenitor cells (EPCs) display a gradient of developmental states based on their proliferative and migratory characteristics, and show spatiotemporal heterogeneity based on gene expression patterns. Many genes and signaling pathways that regulate the migration and proliferation of EPCs have been identified, but later stages of ENS development, especially steps of neuronal and glial differentiation, remain poorly understood. In recent years, Zebrafish have become increasingly important to test candidate genes for ENS disorders (e.g., from genome-wide association studies), to identify environmental influences on ENS development (e.g., through large-scale drug screens), and to investigate the role the gut microbiota play in ENS development and disease. With its unique advantages as a model organism, Zebrafish will continue to contribute to a better understanding of ENS development, function, and disease.

TI  - Comparison of cannabinoids with known analgesics using a novel high throughput zebrafish larval model of nociception
AB  - It has been established that both adult and larval zebrafish are capable of showing nociceptive responses to noxious stimuli; however, the use of larvae to test novel analgesics has not been fully explored. Zebrafish larvae represent a low-cost, high-throughput alternative to traditional mammalian models for the assessment of product efficacy during the initial stages of drug development. In the current study, a novel model of nociception using zebrafish larvae is described. During the recovery from an acute exposure to low levels of acetic acid, larvae display innate changes in behaviour that may be indicative of nociception. To assess the usefulness of this model for testing potential analgesics, three known synthetic pain medications were assessed (ibuprofen, acetaminophen and tramadol) along with three naturally occurring products (honokiol, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol). When the effect of each compound on both the acetic acid recovery and control activity was compared there appeared to be both similarities and differences between the compounds. One of the most interesting effects was found for cannabidiol which appeared to oppose the activity change during the recovery period of AA exposed larvae while having a nominal effect on control activity. This would appear to be in line with current research that has demonstrated the nociceptive properties of cannabidiol. Here we have provided a novel model that will complement existing zebrafish models and will expand on the potential use of zebrafish larvae for studying both nociception and new analgesics. © 2017

TI  - Fish-Microarray: A Miniaturized Platform for Single-Embryo High-Throughput Screenings
AB  - Small molecule high-throughput screenings are essential for the fields of drug discovery and toxicology. Such screenings performed on whole animals are more physiologically relevant leading to more predictive results. However, due to challenges in automation, high costs and absence of miniaturized solutions for animal-based experiments, high throughput screenings based on animal models are still in its infancy. Here a platform for miniaturized high throughput whole-organism screenings is presented. The new platform is based on patterns of hydrophilic spots separated by superhydrophobic borders. The difference in wettability of spots and borders generates the effect of discontinuous dewetting and allows for formation of arrays of microdroplets that incorporate single fish embryos. Due to the flat border-less nature of the platform, the system is compatible with single-step collection of embryos and pipetting-free parallel addition of chemical libraries using the “sandwiching method.” The system is miniaturized and allows for incubation of embryos in volumes as low as 5 µL. Finally, the platform realizes surface tension based immobilization of single embryos inside of each microcompartment and permits high-throughput microscopic analysis directly on the platform. Thus, this method combines the advantages of microarrays, such as high-throughput and simplicity, with the power of in vivo experiments. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

TI  - Injection of an SV40 transcriptional terminator causes embryonic lethality: A possible zebrafish model for screening nonhomologous end-joining inhibitors
AB  - Introduction: DNA repair by the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway promotes tumor recurrence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Discovery of rapid and high-throughput techniques to screen for an effective NHEJ inhibitor drug is imperative for the suppression of NHEJ during tumor treatment. However, traditional screening methods are too cumbersome to meet the current need. Zebrafish is an ideal model for drug screening due to the specificity of its early embryonic development and similarity of tumor cell generation. By exploiting the high frequency of NHEJ in early embryonic development, we established a model that uses a transcriptional terminator signal fragment from the Simian virus 40 (SV40) to cause embryonic lethality. SV40 fragment-induced embryonic lethality was alleviated by 5,6-bis ((E)-benzylideneamino)-2-mercaptopyrimidin-4-ol or C18H14N4OS (SCR7), an NHEJ inhibitor. Materials and methods: A 122 bp SV40 terminator fragment (10 ng/µL) was microinjected into zebrafish zygotes. SV40 fragment integration into the zebrafish embryonic genome was detected by Southern blot using a DNA probe for the SV40 terminator. Embryonic lethality rates were observed 24 and 48 h after microinjection. A nonhomologous recombinant inhibitor, SCR7 (5 µM), was used to alleviate embryonic lethality. Results: Microinjection of zebrafish embryos with the SV40 terminator fragment (10 ng/µL) caused a progressive increase in mortality over time. Using Southern blots, we confirmed that SV40 terminator sequences were integrated into the zebrafish embryonic genome. This phenomenon was effectively alleviated by addition of SCR7. Conclusion: Injection of an SV40 terminator into zebrafish embryos may cause embryonic lethality due to NHEJ during early zebrafish development. The high mortality of zebrafish embryos could be alleviated by using the NHEJ inhibitor, SCR7. The zebrafish model presented here is simpler and more convenient than traditional methods of screening for NHEJ inhibitors and can be utilized in large-scale drug screens for NHEJ inhibitors and for the development of novel anticancer drugs. © 2018 Yang et al.

TI  - Zebrafish as a model for drug screening in genetic kidney diseases
AB  - Genetic disorders account for a wide range of renal diseases emerging during childhood and adolescence. Due to the utilization of modern biochemical and biomedical techniques, the number of identified disease-associated genes is increasing rapidly. Modeling of congenital human disease in animals is key to our understanding of the biological mechanism underlying pathological processes and thus developing novel potential treatment options. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been established as a versatile small vertebrate organism that is widely used for studying human inherited diseases. Genetic accessibility in combination with elegant experimental methods in zebrafish permit modeling of human genetic diseases and dissecting the perturbation of underlying cellular networks and physiological processes. Beyond its utility for genetic analysis and pathophysiological and mechanistic studies, zebrafish embryos, and larvae are amenable for phenotypic screening approaches employing high-content and high-throughput experiments using automated microscopy. This includes large-scale chemical screening experiments using genetic models for searching for disease-modulating compounds. Phenotype-based approaches of drug discovery have been successfully performed in diverse zebrafish-based screening applications with various phenotypic readouts. As a result, these can lead to the identification of candidate substances that are further examined in preclinical and clinical trials. In this review, we discuss zebrafish models for inherited kidney disease as well as requirements and considerations for the technical realization of drug screening experiments in zebrafish. © 2018 Gehrig, Pandey and Westhoff.

TI  - Modulation of threat response in larval zebrafish
AB  - High-throughput, whole-organism phenotypic drug screening is made possible using live zebrafish larvae. Many human drugs have now been shown to affect zebrafish larvae in similar ways, through homologous molecular mechanisms. At this stage in life, zebrafish are small enough to fit in multi-well, microliter plates, yet developed enough to exhibit complex phenotypes, such as hunting behaviors and avoidance of predators. Importantly, zebrafish larvae can be easily dosed via automated pipetting of chemical compounds directly into their liquid medium, without injection. Only microgram amounts of small molecules are required, making animal husbandry and dosing regimens cost effective. This chapter describes how the stereotyped zebrafish larval responses to darkness and strobe light—which cause hyperactivity and freezing behavior, respectively—can be used to efficiently screen small molecules for brain and behavior-modulating activity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Advances in the Use of Zebrafish in Developmental Toxicology: Linking Genetics, Behavior, and High-Throughput Testing Strategies
AB  - Heightened concerns about adverse effects from exposures to the thousands of chemicals in use and present as persistent contaminants in humans and the environment have led to efforts to implement more predictive-based approaches to characterize the toxicity of chemicals in use and promote the design of chemicals with reduced bioactivity. While the zebrafish has been used for many years in environmental toxicology and the biomedical sciences, it has emerged more recently as an integral model to develop more robust and efficient testing strategies. This article describes major advances in genetic tools and testing approaches that have positioned the zebrafish as a key in vivo model in chemical safety evaluations particularly related to teratogenicity. Many toxic responses to chemicals have been shown to be shared among fish and mammals owing to their generally well-conserved development, cellular networks, and organ systems. These shared responses have been observed for chemicals that impair endocrine functioning, development, and reproduction, as well as those that elicit cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity, among many other diseases. High-throughput screening platforms with embryonic zebrafish now enable the screening of large chemical libraries for bioactivity providing opportunities for biological effects testing early in product development. A compelling attribute of the zebrafish centers on being able to characterize toxicity mechanisms across multiple levels of biological organization from the genome to receptor interactions and cellular processes leading to phenotypic perturbations such as developmental deformities. Along with these predictive approaches, a number of behavioral testing strategies have emerged to further assess perturbed nervous system responses to chemical exposures. Finally, there is a growing recognition of the links between human and wildlife health and the need for approaches that allow for assessment of real world multichemical exposures. The zebrafish is poised to be an important model in bridging these two conventionally separate areas of toxicology and characterizing the biological effects of chemical mixtures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

TI  - Small molecule screen in embryonic zebrafish using modular variations to target segmentation
AB  - Small molecule in vivo phenotypic screening is used to identify drugs or biological activities by directly assessing effects in intact organisms. However, current screening designs may not exploit the full potential of chemical libraries due to false negatives. Here, we demonstrate a modular small molecule screen in embryonic zebrafish that varies concentration, genotype and timing to target segmentation disorders, birth defects that affect the spinal column. By testing each small molecule in multiple interrelated ways, this screen recovers compounds that a standard screening design would have missed, increasing the hit frequency from the chemical library three-fold. We identify molecular pathways and segmentation phenotypes, which we share in an open-access annotated database. These hits provide insight into human vertebral segmentation disorders and myopathies. This modular screening strategy is applicable to other developmental questions and disease models, highlighting the power of relatively small chemical libraries to accelerate gene discovery and disease study. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Development of a Whole Organism Platform for Phenotype-Based Analysis of IGF1R-PI3K-Akt-Tor Action
AB  - Aberrant regulation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/insulin (IIS)-PI3K-AKT-TOR signaling pathway is linked to major human diseases, and key components of this pathway are targets for therapeutic intervention. Current assays are molecular target- or cell culture-based platforms. Due to the great in vivo complexities inherited in this pathway, there is an unmet need for whole organism based assays. Here we report the development of a zebrafish transgenic line, Tg(igfbp5a:GFP), which faithfully reports the mitotic action of IGF1R-PI3K-Akt-Tor signaling in epithelial cells in real-time. This platform is well suited for high-throughput assays and real-time cell cycle analysis. Using this platform, the dynamics of epithelial cell proliferation in response to low [Ca2+] stress and the distinct roles of Torc1 and Torc2 were elucidated. The availability of Tg(igfbp5a:GFP) line provides a whole organism platform for phenotype-based discovery of novel players and inhibitors in the IIS-PI3K-Akt-Tor signaling pathway. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Adult zebrafish in CNS disease modeling: A tank that's half-full, not half-empty, and still filling
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly used in a broad array of biomedical studies, from cancer research to drug screening. Zebrafish also represent an emerging model organism for studying complex brain diseases. The number of zebrafish neuroscience studies is exponentially growing, significantly outpacing those conducted with rodents or other model organisms. Yet, there is still a substantial amount of resistance in adopting zebrafish as a first-choice model system. Studies of the repertoire of zebrafish neural and behavioral functions continue to reveal new opportunities for understanding the pathobiology of various CNS deficits. Although some of these models are well established in zebrafish, including models for anxiety, depression, and addiction, others are less recognized, for example, models of autism and obsessive-compulsive states. However, mounting data indicate that a wide spectrum of CNS diseases can be modeled in adult zebrafish. Here, we summarize recent findings using zebrafish CNS assays, discuss model limitations and the existing challenges, as well as outline future directions of research in this field. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Drug discovery for remyelination and treatment of MS
AB  - Glia constitute the majority of the cells in our nervous system, yet there are currently no drugs that target glia for the treatment of disease. Given ongoing discoveries of the many roles of glia in numerous diseases of the nervous system, this is likely to change in years to come. Here we focus on the possibility that targeting the oligodendrocyte lineage to promote regeneration of myelin (remyelination) represents a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, MS. We discuss how hypothesis driven studies have identified multiple targets and pathways that can be manipulated to promote remyelination in vivo, and how this work has led to the first ever remyelination clinical trials. We also highlight how recent chemical discovery screens have identified a host of small molecule compounds that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. Some of these compounds have also been shown to promote myelin regeneration in vivo, with one already being trialled in humans. Promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination represents just one potential strategy for the treatment of MS. The pathology of MS is complex, and its complete amelioration may require targeting multiple biological processes in parallel. Therefore, we present an overview of new technologies and models for phenotypic analyses and screening that can be exploited to study complex cell–cell interactions in in vitro and in vivo systems. Such technological platforms will provide insight into fundamental mechanisms and increase capacities for drug–discovery of relevance to glia and currently intractable disorders of the CNS. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Development of an opioid self-administration assay to study drug seeking in zebrafish
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become an excellent tool to study mental health disorders, due to its physiological and genetic similarity to humans, ease of genetic manipulation, and feasibility of small molecule screening. Zebrafish have been shown to exhibit characteristics of addiction to drugs of abuse in non-contingent assays, including conditioned place preference, but contingent assays have been limited to a single assay for alcohol consumption. Using inexpensive electronic, mechanical, and optical components, we developed an automated opioid self-administration assay for zebrafish, enabling us to measure drug seeking and gain insight into the underlying biological pathways. Zebrafish trained in the assay for five days exhibited robust self-administration, which was dependent on the function of the μ-opioid receptor. In addition, a progressive ratio protocol was used to test conditioned animals for motivation. Furthermore, conditioned fish continued to seek the drug despite an adverse consequence and showed signs of stress and anxiety upon withdrawal of the drug. Finally, we validated our assay by confirming that self-administration in zebrafish is dependent on several of the same molecular pathways as in other animal models. Given the ease and throughput of this assay, it will enable identification of important biological pathways regulating drug seeking and could lead to the development of new therapeutic molecules to treat addiction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Using zebrafish as a model to study the role of epigenetics in hearing loss
AB  - Introduction: The rapid progress of bioinformatics and high-throughput screening techniques in recent years has led to the identification of many candidate genes and small-molecule drugs that have the potential to make significant contributions to our understanding of the developmental and pathological processes of hearing, but it remains unclear how these genes and regulatory factors are coordinated. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are essential for establishing gene expression profiles and likely play an important role in the development of inner ear and in the pathology of hearing-associated diseases. Zebrafish are a valuable and tractable in vivo model organism for monitoring changes in the epigenome and for identifying new epigenetic processes and drug molecules that can influence vertebrate development. Areas covered: In this review, the authors focus on zebrafish as a model to summarize recent findings concerning the roles of epigenetics in the development, regeneration, and protection of hair cells. Expert opinion: Using the zebrafish model in combination with high-throughput screening and genome-editing technologies to investigate the function of epigenetics in hearing is crucial to help us better understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms of auditory development and function. It will also contribute to the development of new strategies to restore hearing loss. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Quo natas, Danio?—Recent Progress in Modeling Cancer in Zebrafish
AB  - Over the last decade, zebrafish has proven to be a powerful model in cancer research. Zebrafish form tumors that histologically and genetically resemble human cancers. The live imaging and cost-effective compound screening possible with zebrafish especially complement classic mouse cancer models. Here, we report recent progress in the field, including genetically engineered zebrafish cancer models, xenotransplantation of human cancer cells into zebrafish, promising approaches toward live investigation of the tumor microenvironment, and identification of therapeutic strategies by performing compound screens on zebrafish cancer models. Given the recent advances in genome editing, personalized zebrafish cancer models are now a realistic possibility. In addition, ongoing automation will soon allow high-throughput compound screening using zebrafish cancer models to be part of preclinical precision medicine approaches. © 2017 Kirchberger, Sturtzel, Pascoal and Distel.

TI  - Zebrafish as a model organism for the development of drugs for skin cancer
AB  - Skin cancer, which includes melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, represents the most common type of cutaneous malignancy worldwide, and its incidence is expected to rise in the near future. This condition derives from acquired genetic dysregulation of signaling pathways involved in the proliferation and apoptosis of skin cells. The development of animal models has allowed a better understanding of these pathomechanisms, with the possibility of carrying out toxicological screening and drug development. In particular, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been established as one of the most important model organisms for cancer research. This model is particularly suitable for live cell imaging and high-throughput drug screening in a large-scale fashion. Thanks to the recent advances in genome editing, such as the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) methodologies, the mechanisms associated with cancer development and progression, as well as drug resistance can be investigated and comprehended. With these unique tools, the zebrafish represents a powerful platform for skin cancer research in the development of target therapies. Here, we will review the advantages of using the zebrafish model for drug discovery and toxicological and phenotypical screening. We will focus in detail on the most recent progress in the field of zebrafish model generation for the study of melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), including cancer cell injection and transgenic animal development. Moreover, we will report the latest compounds and small molecules under investigation in melanoma zebrafish models. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Fluorinated benzenesulfonamide anticancer inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase IX exhibit lower toxic effects on zebrafish embryonic development than ethoxzolamide
AB  - The toxic effects of two recently discovered inhibitors (VD12-09 and VD11-4-2) that selectively and with extraordinary strong, picomolar binding affinity to human carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoform IX were investigated on zebrafish embryonic development. CA IX has been recently introduced as an anticancer target since it is highly overexpressed in numerous human cancers but nearly absent in normal tissues. Morphological changes in zebrafish treated by the compounds were studied by light-field microscopy and histological analysis. Homology models of zebrafish CA II and CA IX were built to identify the conserved amino acid residues in the active site of zebrafish CAs. The toxicity studies here showed that the LC50 values at 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf) were 13 μM for VD12-09, 120 μM for VD11-4-2, and 9 μM for ethoxzolamide (EZA), a non-selective CA inhibitor commonly used as a drug in clinics. Thus, EZA was the most toxic of the three compounds. The zebrafish embryos exposed to LC50 doses of VD12-09 and VD11-4-2 showed fewer phenotypic abnormalities compared with the embryos exposed to the corresponding dose of EZA. Histochemical studies did not show any gross morphological changes in the embryos treated with VD12-09 and VD11-4-2 unlike EZA. The results of our study indicate that the compounds exhibited 10-fold lower toxicity and induced fewer side effects in zebrafish than EZA. Therefore, the exposure to VD11-4-2 and VD12-09 at concentrations below LC50 did not lead to deleterious effects on the zebrafish embryonic development and thus both inhibitors may be further developed as drugs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - From fish bowl to bedside: The power of zebrafish to unravel melanoma pathogenesis and discover new therapeutics
AB  - Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadliest form of skin cancer. A detailed knowledge of the cellular, molecular, and genetic events underlying melanoma progression is highly relevant to diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification, and the development of new therapies. In the last decade, zebrafish have emerged as a valuable model system for the study of melanoma. Pathway conservation, coupled with the availability of robust genetic, transgenic, and chemical tools, has made the zebrafish a powerful model for identifying novel disease genes, visualizing cancer initiation, interrogating tumor–microenvironment interactions, and discovering new therapeutics that regulate melanocyte and melanoma development. In this review, we will give an overview of these studies, and highlight recent advancements that will help unravel melanoma pathogenesis and impact human disease. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Little fish, big data: Zebrafish as a model for cardiovascular and metabolic disease
AB  - The burden of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases worldwide is staggering. The emergence of systems approaches in biology promises new therapies, faster and cheaper diagnostics, and personalized medicine. However, a profound understanding of pathogenic mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels remains a fundamental requirement for discovery and therapeutics. Animal models of human disease are cornerstones of drug discovery as they allow identification of novel pharmacological targets by linking gene function with pathogenesis. The zebrafish model has been used for decades to study development and pathophysiology. More than ever, the specific strengths of the zebrafish model make it a prime partner in an age of discovery transformed by big-data approaches to genomics and disease. Zebrafish share a largely conserved physiology and anatomy with mammals. They allow a wide range of genetic manipulations, including the latest genome engineering approaches. They can be bred and studied with remarkable speed, enabling a range of large-scale phenotypic screens. Finally, zebrafish demonstrate an impressive regenerative capacity scientists hope to unlock in humans. Here, we provide a comprehensive guide on applications of zebrafish to investigate cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. We delineate advantages and limitations of zebrafish models of human disease and summarize their most significant contributions to understanding disease progression to date. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

TI  - Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a major and increasing burden on families, communities, and national health budgets. Despite intensive and extended research there is still widespread debate about its cause(s) and no effective treatments exist. Familial (inherited, mainly early onset) and sporadic (mainly late onset) forms of the disease exist and it is uncertain to what extent they are related. Transgenic mouse models have dominated the investigation of this disease but their validity can be questioned. Numerous alternative models exist that can provide valuable information on the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease. In this chapter we review the various invertebrate, nonmammalian vertebrate, and mammalian models and how these have been used to investigate this disease. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of these various model systems. Of course, animal models never completely reflect the true nature of a human disease but progress in understanding and finding preventative and ameliorative treatments for Alzheimer's disease is hindered by the lack of a convincing hypothesis for the cause of this complex condition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Attacking sleep from a new angle: contributions from zebrafish
AB  - Sleep consumes a third of our lifespan, but we are far from understanding how it is initiated, maintained and terminated, or what purposes it serves. To address these questions, alternative model systems have recently been recruited. The diurnal zebrafish holds the promise of bridging the gap between simple invertebrate systems, which show little neuroanatomical conservation with mammals, and well-established, but complex and nocturnal, murine systems. Zebrafish larvae can be monitored in a high-throughput fashion, pharmacologically tested by adding compounds into the water, genetically screened using transient transgenesis, and optogenetically manipulated in a non-invasive manner. Here we discuss work that has established the zebrafish as a powerful system for the study of sleep, as well as novel insights gained by exploiting its particular advantages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - ZeGlobalTox: An innovative approach to address organ drug toxicity using zebrafish
AB  - Toxicity is one of the major attrition causes during the drug development process. In that line, cardio-, neuro-, and hepatotoxicities are among the main reasons behind the retirement of drugs in clinical phases and post market withdrawal. Zebrafish exploitation in high-throughput drug screening is becoming an important tool to assess the toxicity and efficacy of novel drugs. This animal model has, from early developmental stages, fully functional organs from a physiological point of view. Thus, drug-induced organ-toxicity can be detected in larval stages, allowing a high predictive power on possible human drug-induced liabilities. Hence, zebrafish can bridge the gap between preclinical in vitro safety assays and rodent models in a fast and cost-effective manner. ZeGlobalTox is an innovative assay that sequentially integrates in vivo cardio-, neuro-, and hepatotoxicity assessment in the same animal, thus impacting strongly in the 3Rs principles. It Reduces, by up to a third, the number of animals required to assess toxicity in those organs. It Refines the drug toxicity evaluation through novel physiological parameters. Finally, it might allow the Replacement of classical species, such as rodents and larger mammals, thanks to its high predictivity (Specificity: 89%, Sensitivity: 68% and Accuracy: 78%). © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Natural Compounds as Occult Ototoxins? Ginkgo biloba Flavonoids Moderately Damage Lateral Line Hair Cells
AB  - Several drugs, including aminoglycosides and platinum-based chemotherapy agents, are well known for their ototoxic properties. However, FDA-approved drugs are not routinely tested for ototoxicity, so their potential to affect hearing often goes unrecognized. This issue is further compounded for natural products, where there is a lack of FDA oversight and the manufacturer is solely responsible for ensuring the safety of their products. Natural products such as herbal supplements are easily accessible and commonly used in the practice of traditional eastern and alternative medicine. Using the zebrafish lateral line, we screened a natural products library to identify potential ototoxins. We found that the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol, both from the Gingko biloba plant, demonstrated significant ototoxicity, killing up to 30 % of lateral line hair cells. We then examined a third Ginkgo flavonoid, isorhamnetin, and found similar levels of ototoxicity. After flavonoid treatment, surviving hair cells demonstrated reduced uptake of the vital dye FM 1-43FX, suggesting that the health of the remaining hair cells was compromised. We then asked if these flavonoids enter hair cells through the mechanotransduction channel, which is the site of entry for many known ototoxins. High extracellular calcium or the quinoline derivative E6 berbamine significantly protected hair cells from flavonoid damage, implicating the transduction channel as a site of flavonoid uptake. Since known ototoxins activate cellular stress responses, we asked if reactive oxygen species were necessary for flavonoid ototoxicity. Co-treatment with the antioxidant D-methionine significantly protected hair cells from each flavonoid, suggesting that antioxidant therapy could prevent hair cell loss. How these products affect mammalian hair cells is still an open question and will be the target of future experiments. However, this research demonstrates the potential for ototoxic damage caused by unregulated herbal supplements and suggests that further supplement characterization is warranted. © 2016, Association for Research in Otolaryngology.

TI  - Getting the whole picture: High content screening using three-dimensional cellular model systems and whole animal assays
AB  - Phenotypic or High Content Screening (HCS) is becoming more widely used for primary screening campaigns in drug discovery. Currently the vast majority of HCS campaigns are using cell lines grown in well-established monolayer cultures (2D tissue culture). There is widespread recognition that the more biologically relevant 3D tissue culture technologies such as spheroids and organoids and even whole animal assays will eventually be run as primary HCS. Upgrading the IT infrastructure to cope with the increase in data volumes requires investments in hardware (and software) and this will be manageable. However, the main bottleneck for the effective adoption and use of 3D tissue culture and whole animal assays in HCS is anticipated to be the development of software for the analysis of 3D images. In this review we summarize the current state of the available software and how they may be applied to analyzing 3D images obtained from a HCS campaign. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

TI  - Environmental Pollution and the Fish Heart
AB  - As a nonstop pump driven by physiologically complex excitable cells, the heart is especially susceptible to a variety of insults, in particular exogenous chemicals. In humans, for example, heart-related toxicities are the most common adverse drug reaction. Fish living in polluted environments may or may not be able to avoid exposure to cardiotoxic chemicals. Nevertheless, juvenile and adult fish have a variety of robust mechanisms for protecting the heart from toxic chemicals, such as hepatic metabolism. The situation is very different for fish early life history stages, in particular very small embryos and larvae. The developing heart is the first organ to become functional in embryos, at a point very early in its morphogenesis. Owing to the intimate and interacting links between form and function in the developing heart, very subtle cardiotoxicity during embryogenesis can cause serious and long-lasting outcomes. Fish embryos have minimal capacity for metabolic detoxification, and therefore, developmental cardiotoxicity is a real-world environmental health concern for wild populations. This chapter focuses on the exquisite sensitivity of the developing fish heart to chemical contaminants, as demonstrated through aquatic pollution case studies focused on legacy organochlorine compounds and recent oil spills. These studies have revealed a diversity of mechanisms linking cardiomyocyte physiology to heart development, and abnormal development in turn to latent impacts on physiology at later life stages. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An update on anticancer drug development and delivery targeting carbonic anhydrase IX
AB  - The expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX is up-regulated in many types of solid tumors in humans under hypoxic and acidic microenvironment. Inhibition of CA IX enzymatic activity with selective inhibitors, antibodies or labeled probes has been shown to reverse the acidic environment of solid tumors and reduce the tumor growth establishing the significant role of CA IX in tumorigenesis. Thus, the development of potent antitumor drugs targeting CA IX with minimal toxic effects is important for the target-specific tumor therapy. Recently, several promising antitumor agents against CA IX have been developed to treat certain types of cancers in combination with radiation and chemotherapy. Here we review the inhibition of CA IX by small molecule compounds and monoclonal antibodies. The methods of enzymatic assays, biophysical methods, animal models including zebrafish and Xenopus oocytes, and techniques of diagnostic imaging to detect hypoxic tumors using CA IX-targeted conjugates are discussed with the aim to overview the recent progress related to novel therapeutic agents that target CA IX in hypoxic tumors. © 2017 Kazokaitė et al.

TI  - Glycosylation related to the development and regeneration of zebrafish
AB  - The study on tissue development and regeneration is one of the hot spots of life science. Zebrafish has become one of the popular model organisms due to its rapid growth rate, transparent embryos which is easy to observe, and the capacity to regenerate fin, heart, nervous system, etc. During the development and regeneration process of zebrafish, cell proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis and other metabolic activities occurs,but little is known about the regulatory mechanism among such complex dynamic processes to us. Further studies on these processes have magnificent meanings, for instance, laying a theoretical foundation for the treatment of many diseases, and also promoting the progress of tissue engineering. Previous study has shown that multifold proteins involved in the regulation of tissue development and regeneration. Protein glycosylation is an important post-translational modification, which can affect cell recognition, adhesion, and signal transduction, even lead to inflammation, cancer and other malignant diseases. In recent years, the development of glycomics provides new ideas for developmental biology and regenerative medicine. In this present review, we summarize the role of glycosylation alteration in the development process of zebrafish, and prospect for its future study on regeneration.

TI  - Simultaneous degradation of tetracycline by a microbial fuel cell and its toxicity evaluation by zebrafish
AB  - Tetracycline (TC) is the second most commonly used antibiotic despite its high toxicity and persistence. In this study, a new approach for the anaerobic biodegradation of TC in a microbial fuel cell (MFC), with glucose-TC mixtures as the substrate, under gradient acclimation conditions was explored. Within 7 days, approximately 79.1% of TC was degraded by the MFC. This value was higher than that obtained through a traditional anaerobic method (14.9%). The TC degradation rates in MFCs with a closed circuit were 31.6% higher than those in MFCs with an open circuit. Furthermore, zebrafish assessment showed that no toxicity was observed after MFC treatment. Microbial community analysis was performed on the anode of the MFCs under gradient acclimation conditions, and the results showed that TC was effectively degraded by the synergy of fermentative bacteria, acid-producing bacteria and electrogenic bacteria. This work confirmed that the anaerobic biodegradation of TC by MFCs is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - The Power of Zebrafish in personalised medicine
AB  - The goal of personalised medicine is to develop tailor-made therapies for patients in whom currently available therapeutics fail. This approach requires correlating individual patient genotype data to specific disease phenotype data and using these stratified data sets to identify bespoke therapeutics. Applications for personalised medicine include common complex diseases which may have multiple targets, as well as rare monogenic disorders, for which the target may be unknown. In both cases, whole genome sequence analysis (WGS) is discovering large numbers of disease associated mutations in new candidate genes and potential modifier genes. Currently, the main limiting factor is the determination of which mutated genes are important for disease progression and therefore represent potential targets for drug discovery. Zebrafish have gained popularity as a model organism for understanding developmental processes, disease mechanisms and more recently for drug discovery and toxicity testing. In this chapter, we will examine the diverse roles that zebrafish can make in the expanding field of personalised medicine, from generating humanised disease models to xenograft screening of different cancer cell lines, through to finding new drugs via in vivo phenotypic screens. We will discuss the tools available for zebrafish research and recent advances in techniques, highlighting the advantages and potential of using zebrafish for high throughput disease modeling and precision drug discovery. © American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2017.

TI  - Using the zebrafish to understand tendon development and repair
AB  - Tendons are important components of our musculoskeletal system. Injuries to these tissues are very common, resulting from occupational-related injuries, sports-related trauma, and age-related degeneration. Unfortunately, there are few treatment options, and current therapies rarely restore injured tendons to their original function. An improved understanding of the pathways regulating their development and repair would have significant impact in stimulating the formulation of regenerative-based approaches for tendon injury. The zebrafish provides an ideal system in which to perform genetic and chemical screens to identify new pathways involved in tendon biology. Until recently, there had been few descriptions of tendons and ligaments in the zebrafish and their similarity to mammalian tendon tissues. In this chapter, we describe the development of the zebrafish tendon and ligament tissues in the context of their gene expression, structure, and interactions with neighboring musculoskeletal tissues. We highlight the similarities with tendon development in higher vertebrates, showing that the craniofacial tendons and ligaments in zebrafish morphologically, molecularly, and structurally resemble mammalian tendons and ligaments from embryonic to adult stages. We detail methods for fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry as an assay to examine morphological changes in the zebrafish musculoskeleton. Staining assays such as these could provide the foundation for screen-based approaches to identify new regulators of tendon development, morphogenesis, and repair. These discoveries would provide new targets and pathways to study in the context of regenerative medicine–based approaches to improve tendon healing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Muscular dystrophy modeling in zebrafish
AB  - Skeletal muscle performs an essential function in human physiology with defects in genes encoding a variety of cellular components resulting in various types of inherited muscle disorders. Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a severe and heterogeneous type of human muscle disease, manifested by progressive muscle wasting and degeneration. The disease pathogenesis and therapeutic options for MDs have been investigated for decades using rodent models, and considerable knowledge has been accumulated on the cause and pathogenetic mechanisms of this group of human disorders. However, due to some differences between disease severity and progression, what is learned in mammalian models does not always transfer to humans, prompting the desire for additional and alternative models. More recently, zebrafish have emerged as a novel and robust animal model for the study of human muscle disease. Zebrafish MD models possess a number of distinct advantages for modeling human muscle disorders, including the availability and ease of generating mutations in homologous disease-causing genes, the ability to image living muscle tissue in an intact animal, and the suitability of zebrafish larvae for large-scale chemical screens. In this chapter, we review the current understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in MDs, the process of myogenesis in zebrafish, and the structural and functional characteristics of zebrafish larval muscles. We further discuss the insights gained from the key zebrafish MD models that have been so far generated, and we summarize the attempts that have been made to screen for small molecules inhibitors of the dystrophic phenotypes using these models. Overall, these studies demonstrate that zebrafish is a useful in vivo system for modeling aspects of human skeletal muscle disorders. Studies using these models have contributed both to the understanding of the pathogenesis of muscle wasting disorders and demonstrated their utility as highly relevant models to implement therapeutic screening regimens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish Pancreas Development and Regeneration: Fishing for Diabetes Therapies
AB  - The zebrafish pancreas shares its basic organization and cell types with the mammalian pancreas. In addition, the developmental pathways that lead to the establishment of the pancreatic islets of Langherhans are generally conserved from fish to mammals. Zebrafish provides a powerful tool to probe the mechanisms controlling establishment of the pancreatic endocrine cell types from early embryonic progenitor cells, as well as the regeneration of endocrine cells after damage. This knowledge is, in turn, applicable to refining protocols to generate renewable sources of human pancreatic islet cells that are critical for regulation of blood sugar levels. Here, we review how previous and ongoing studies in zebrafish and beyond are influencing the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying various forms of diabetes and efforts to develop cell-based approaches to cure this increasingly widespread disease. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Analysis of myelinated axon formation in zebrafish
AB  - Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath formed by the spiral wrapping of specialized glial cells around axon segments. Myelinating glia allow for rapid transmission of nerve impulses and metabolic support of axons, and the absence of or disruption to myelin results in debilitating motor, cognitive, and emotional deficits in humans. Because myelin is a jawed vertebrate innovation, zebrafish are one of the simplest vertebrate model systems to study the genetics and development of myelinating glia. The morphogenetic cellular movements and genetic program that drive myelination are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, and myelin develops rapidly in zebrafish larvae, within 3–5 days postfertilization. Myelin ultrastructure can be visualized in the zebrafish from larval to adult stages via transmission electron microscopy, and the dynamic development of myelinating glial cells may be observed in vivo via transgenic reporter lines in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish are amenable to genetic and pharmacological screens, and screens for myelinating glial phenotypes have revealed both genes and drugs that promote myelin development, many of which are conserved in mammalian glia. Recently, zebrafish have been employed as a model to understand the complex dynamics of myelinating glia during development and regeneration. In this chapter, we describe these key methodologies and recent insights into mechanisms that regulate myelination using the zebrafish model. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Hematopoietic stem cell development: Using the zebrafish to identify extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis
AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside at the apex of the hematopoietic hierarchy, giving rise to each of the blood lineages found throughout the lifetime of the organism. Since the genetic programs regulating HSC development are highly conserved between vertebrate species, experimental studies in zebrafish have not only complemented observations reported in mammals but have also yielded important discoveries that continue to influence our understanding of HSC biology and homeostasis. Here, we summarize findings that have established zebrafish as an important conserved model for the study of hematopoiesis, and describe methods that can be utilized for future investigations of zebrafish HSC biology. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Surface modification of nanostructure lipid carrier (NLC) by oleoyl-quaternized-chitosan as a mucoadhesive nanocarrier
AB  - A nanostructure lipid carrier (NLC) composed of solid, and liquid lipid as a core has been developed as a delivery system for hydrophobic drug molecules. The aim of this research was to fabricate an oleoyl-quaternized-chitosan (CS)-coated NLC, where the mucoadhesive property of nanoparticles is enhanced for more efficient drug delivery. NLC loaded with alpha-mangostin (AP), a model hydrophobic drug, were fabricated using a high pressure homogenization process and subsequently coated with CS. The fabricated nanoparticles showed particle sizes in the range of 200–400 nm, with low polydispersity, high physical stability and excellent encapsulation efficiency (EE > 90%). Additionally, in vitro viability, cytotoxicity and ability of NLC and CS-NLC to affect apoptosis in carcinoma Caco-2 cells were determined using the Triplex assay. Gene expressiom analysis were performed using quantitative reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, in vivo toxicological testing of NLCs was conducted in zebrafish embryos. Results indicated that CS-NLC provieded high cytotoxicity than NLC itself. In the case of AP loaded nanoparticles, NLC loaded with AP (AP-NLC), and CS-NLC loaded with AP (CS-AP-NLC) exhibited higher cytotoxicity to Caco-2 over Hela cells. These results indicate that CS-NLC shows enhanced cellular uptake but increased cytotoxicity characteristics over NLC and therefore careful optimization of dosage and loading levels in CS-NLC is needed to allow cancer cell targeting, and for exploiting the potential of these systems in cancer therapy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - ARQiv-HTS, a versatile whole-organism screening platform enabling in vivo drug discovery at high-throughput rates
AB  - The zebrafish has emerged as an important model for whole-organism small-molecule screening. However, most zebrafish-based chemical screens have achieved only mid-throughput rates. Here we describe a versatile whole-organism drug discovery platform that can achieve true high-throughput screening (HTS) capacities. This system combines our automated reporter quantification in vivo (ARQiv) system with customized robotics, and is termed 'ARQiv-HTS'. We detail the process of establishing and implementing ARQiv-HTS: (i) assay design and optimization, (ii) calculation of sample size and hit criteria, (iii) large-scale egg production, (iv) automated compound titration, (v) dispensing of embryos into microtiter plates, and (vi) reporter quantification. We also outline what we see as best practice strategies for leveraging the power of ARQiv-HTS for zebrafish-based drug discovery, and address technical challenges of applying zebrafish to large-scale chemical screens. Finally, we provide a detailed protocol for a recently completed inaugural ARQiv-HTS effort, which involved the identification of compounds that elevate insulin reporter activity. Compounds that increased the number of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells represent potential new therapeutics for diabetic patients. For this effort, individual screening sessions took 1 week to conclude, and sessions were performed iteratively approximately every other day to increase throughput. At the conclusion of the screen, more than a half million drug-treated larvae had been evaluated. Beyond this initial example, however, the ARQiv-HTS platform is adaptable to almost any reporter-based assay designed to evaluate the effects of chemical compounds in living small-animal models. ARQiv-HTS thus enables large-scale whole-organism drug discovery for a variety of model species and from numerous disease-oriented perspectives. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Global proteomic analysis of lysine acetylation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - Lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM). Since the development of MS-based proteomics technology, important roles of lysine acetylation beyond histones have focused on chromatin remodeling during the cell cycle and regulation of nuclear transport, metabolism, and translation. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a widely used vertebrate model in genetics and biologic studies. Although studies in several mammalian species have been performed, the mechanism of lysine acetylation in D. rerio embryos is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the global acetylome in D. rerio embryos by using an MS-based proteomics approach. We identified 351 acetylated peptides and 377 nonredundant acetylation sites on 189 lysine-acetylated proteins in 5-day postfertilization (hpf) embryos of D. rerio. Among lysine-acetylated peptides, 40.2% indicated three motifs: (ac)KxxxK, (ac)KxxxxK, and Lx(ac)K. Of 190 acetylated proteins, 81 (42.6%) were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses showed that lysine acetylation in D. rerio was enriched in metabolic pathways. Additionally, 17 of 30 acetylated ribosomal proteins were evolutionarily conserved between zebrafish and humans. Our results indicate that acetyllysine might have regulatory effects on ribosomal proteins involved in protein biosynthesis. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI  - An quaternary chiral latam derivative, YH-304 as a novel broad-spectrum anticancer agent
AB  - Previously, we reported that quaternary chiral lactam derivatives have broad spectrum anticancer activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and its relevance are largely unknown. In the present study, we report progress on quaternary chiral lactam analogues that address this, focusing on the novel analogue YH-304 as a candidate to broadly target human cancer cells. The effect of YH-304 on cell transformation was assessed by clonogenic assay in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs) A549 and 226B. Proapoptotic activity of YH-304 was determined by TUNEL assay and cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-9, and Bax as markers for apoptosis. The p53-dependency and therapeutic spectrum of YH-304 was assessed by western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and cell viability assays in cells expressing endogenous wild or mutant p53. The effect of YH-304 on angiogenesis in vivo was examined by bFGF-mediated angiogenesis assay in zebrafish. Finally, the effect of YH-304 on AKT and ERK activation (phosphorylation) as a putative mechanism underlying the effect of YH-304 on bFGF-mediated angiogenesis was assessed using western blotting. We found that YH-304 significantly decreases the colony-forming activities of both A549 and 226B cells, inducing cellular apoptosis. Unlike nutlin-3 (p53 pathway activator), YH-304 did not affect the expression levels of p53 and its target gene such as p21 and thus showed p53-independent anticancer activity with broad spectrum. In addition, YH-304 inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo through mediating AKT and ERK signaling pathway, which plays an important role in bFGF activation and angiogenesis. Taken together, our data indicate that YH-304 may represent a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer in a p53-independent manner.

TI  - Deep phenotyping unveils hidden traits and genetic relations in subtle mutants
AB  - Discovering mechanistic insights from phenotypic information is critical for the understanding of biological processes. For model organisms, unlike in cell culture, this is currently bottlenecked by the non-quantitative nature and perceptive biases of human observations, and the limited number of reporters that can be simultaneously incorporated in live animals. An additional challenge is that isogenic populations exhibit significant phenotypic heterogeneity. These difficulties limit genetic approaches to many biological questions. To overcome these bottlenecks, we developed tools to extract complex phenotypic traits from images of fluorescently labelled subcellular landmarks, using C. elegans synapses as a test case. By population-wide comparisons, we identified subtle but relevant differences inaccessible to subjective conceptualization. Furthermore, the models generated testable hypotheses of how individual alleles relate to known mechanisms or belong to new pathways. We show that our model not only recapitulates current knowledge in synaptic patterning but also identifies novel alleles overlooked by traditional methods. © 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - Cell wall distracting anti-Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus compound PVI331 from a marine sponge associated Streptomyces
AB  - Isolation of unexplored frontier molecules are needed to treat multidrug resistant pathogens especially Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A marine sponge endosymbiotic Streptomyces albus ICN33 produces an anti-MRSA metabolite is reported. The crude extract exhibited anti-MRSA activity and the active principle was isolated through fermentation and chromatographic techniques. A compound PVI331 with a molecular mass of 506 Da have been determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. LC–MS based dereplication analysis had revealed that the detected compound PVI331 as unknown. The antibacterial assay of the compound PVI331 showed remarkable antagonistic activity against MRSA and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were found to be 1 μg/ml against MRSA. Sub-inhibitory concentration of the compound PVI331 reduced the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 and increased the cell surface hydrophobicity index. Scanning electron microscopic observation of the sub-inhibitory concentration exposure revealed a wrinkled membrane surface and slight cellular damage shows the cell wall distracting property of the compound. Zebrafish embryo based toxicity assays exhibited 48 ± 2 μg/ml of LC50 value and 30 μg/ml of compound as maximal non-lethal concentration which had demonstrated the positive relationship in safety index. This study highlighted the anti-MRSA property of Streptomyces albus ICN33 from a marine sponge. © 2016 Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice

TI  - A high-content larval zebrafish brain imaging method for small molecule drug discovery
AB  - Drug discovery in whole-organisms such as zebrafish is a promising approach for identifying biologically-relevant lead compounds. However, high content imaging of zebrafish at cellular resolution is challenging due to the difficulty in orienting larvae en masse such that the cell type of interest is in clear view. We report the development of the multi-pose imaging method, which uses 96-well round bottom plates combined with a standard liquid handler to repose the larvae within each well multiple times, such that an image in a specific orientation can be acquired. We have validated this method in a chemo-genetic zebrafish model of dopaminergic neuron degeneration. For this purpose, we have developed an analysis pipeline that identifies the larval brain in each image and then quantifies neuronal health in CellProfiler. Our method achieves a SSMD∗ score of 6.96 (robust Z'-factor of 0.56) and is suitable for screening libraries up to 105 compounds in size. © 2016 Liu et al.

TI  - An in vivo multiplexed small-molecule screening platform
AB  - Phenotype-based small-molecule screening is a powerful method to identify molecules that regulate cellular functions. However, such screens are generally performed in vitro under conditions that do not necessarily model complex physiological conditions or disease states. Here, we use molecular cell barcoding to enable direct in vivo phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries. The multiplexed nature of this approach allows rapid in vivo analysis of hundreds to thousands of compounds. Using this platform, we screened >700 covalent inhibitors directed toward hydrolases for their effect on pancreatic cancer metastatic seeding. We identified multiple hits and confirmed the relevant target of one compound as the lipase ABHD6. Pharmacological and genetic studies confirmed the role of this enzyme as a regulator of metastatic fitness. Our results highlight the applicability of this multiplexed screening platform for investigating complex processes in vivo. © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Melanogenesis inhibitors: Strategies for searching for and evaluation of active compounds
AB  - Hyperpigmentation disorders constitute important medical and aesthetical conditions. Dark areas or dark spots on the skin result from inappropriate amount and/or deposition of skin pigments - melanins. Several depigmenting agents, such as kojic acid, arbutin, aloesin, ellagic acid, resveratrol, azelaic acid, niacinamide, tretinoin, glycolic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid, have already been identified and are used in topical drugs or cosmetic formulations for the treatment of hyperpigmentations. However, these compounds are characterized by insufficient effectiveness and multiple adverse effects. As a result, there is still a need for searching for new active substances. The current paper summarizes strategies for searching for novel melanogenesis inhibitors. In the review, they are divided according to approach, into in silico, in vitro and in vivo experiments. In silico research includes computational studies with models of tyrosinase and di-copper complexes. The in vitro approach is based on tests using tyrosinase (a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis), cell cultures, cell co-cultures, pigmented human skin equivalents or Streptomyces bikiniensis model. In vivo studies involve zebrafish, rodents or humans. Examples of protocols and laboratory procedures are presented, with a focus on utilization of various models for evaluation of mechanisms of action of tested compounds. The potential limitations of the methods are also discussed, together with future perspectives in the field of searching for melanogenesis inhibitors. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Activation of sterol regulatory element binding factors by fenofibrate and gemfibrozil stimulates myelination in zebrafish
AB  - Oligodendrocytes are major myelin-producing cells and play essential roles in the function of a healthy nervous system. However, they are also one of the most vulnerable neural cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin abnormalities in the CNS are found in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, and schizophrenia. There is an urgent need to identify small molecular weight compounds that can stimulate myelination. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis to identify pharmacodynamic effects common to miconazole and clobetasol, which have been shown to stimulate myelination by mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Of the genes differentially expressed in both miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mouse OPCs compared with untreated cells, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both drug treatments. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these DEGs are significantly associated with the sterol biosynthetic pathway, and further bioinformatics analysis suggested that sterol regulatory element binding factors (SREBFs) might be key upstream regulators of the DEGs. In silico screening of a public database for chemicals associated with SREBF activation identified fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa) agonist, as a drug that increases the expression of known SREBF targets, raising the possibility that fenofibrate may also stimulate myelination. To test this, we performed in vivo imaging of zebrafish expressing a fluorescent reporter protein under the control of the myelin basic protein (mbp) promoter. Treatment of zebrafish with fenofibrate significantly increased expression of the fluorescent reporter compared with untreated zebrafish. This increase was attenuated by co-treatment with fatostatin, a specific inhibitor of SREBFs, confirming that the fenofibrate effect was mediated via SREBFs. Furthermore, incubation of zebrafish with another PPARa agonist, gemfibrozil, also increased expression of the mbp promoter-driven fluorescent reporter in an SREBF-dependent manner. These results suggest that activation of SREBFs by small molecular weight compounds may be a feasible therapeutic approach to stimulate myelination. © 2016 Ashikawa, Nishimura, Okabe, Sasagawa, Murakami, Yuge, Kawaguchi, Kawase and Tanaka.

TI  - σ 1 receptor ligands control a switch between passive and active threat responses
AB  - Humans and many animals show 'freezing' behavior in response to threatening stimuli. In humans, inappropriate threat responses are fundamental characteristics of several mental illnesses. To identify small molecules that modulate threat responses, we developed a high-throughput behavioral assay in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and evaluated 10,000 compounds for their effects on freezing behavior. We found three classes of compounds that switch the threat response from freezing to escape-like behavior. We then screened these for binding activity across 45 candidate targets. Using target profile clustering, we identified the sigma-1 (σ 1) receptor as having a role in the mechanism of behavioral switching and confirmed that known σ 1 ligands also disrupt freezing behavior. Furthermore, mutation of the gene encoding σ 1 prevented the behavioral effect of escape-inducing compounds. One compound, which we call finazine, potently bound mammalian σ 1 and altered threat-response behavior in mice. Thus, pharmacological and genetic interrogation of the freezing response revealed σ 1 as a mediator of threat responses in vertebrates. © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reversal of pentylenetetrazole-altered swimming and neural activity-regulated gene expression in zebrafish larvae by valproic acid and valerian extract
AB  - Rationale: Ethnopharmacology has documented hundreds of psychoactive plants awaiting exploitation for drug discovery. A robust and inexpensive in vivo system allowing systematic screening would be critical to exploiting this knowledge. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish a cheap and accurate screening method which can be used for testing psychoactive efficacy of complex mixtures of unknown composition, like plant crude extracts. Methods: We used automated recording of zebrafish larval swimming behavior during light vs. dark periods which we reproducibly altered with an anxiogenic compound, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). First, we reversed this PTZ-altered swimming by co-treatment with a well-defined synthetic anxiolytic drug, valproic acid (VPA). Next, we aimed at reversing it by adding crude root extracts of Valeriana officinalis (Val) from which VPA was originally derived. Finally, we assessed how expression of neural activity-regulated genes (c-fos, npas4a, and bdnf) known to be upregulated by PTZ treatment was affected in the presence of Val. Results: Both VPA and Val significantly reversed the PTZ-altered swimming behaviors. Noticeably, Val at higher doses was affecting swimming independently of the presence of PTZ. A strong regulation of all three neural-activity genes was observed in Val-treated larvae which fully supported the behavioral results. Conclusions: We demonstrated in a combined behavioral-molecular approach the strong psychoactivity of a natural extract of unknown composition made from V. officinalis. Our results highlight the efficacy and sensitivity of such an approach, therefore offering a novel in vivo screening system amenable to high-throughput testing of promising ethnobotanical candidates. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - Aggregate entropy scoring for quantifying activity across endpoints with irregular correlation structure
AB  - Robust computational approaches are needed to characterize systems-level responses to chemical perturbations in environmental and clinical toxicology applications. Appropriate characterization of response presents a methodological challenge when dealing with diverse phenotypic endpoints measured using in vivo systems. In this article, we propose an information-theoretic method named Aggregate Entropy (AggE) and apply it to scoring multiplexed, phenotypic endpoints measured in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) across a broad concentration-response profile for a diverse set of 1060 chemicals. AggE accurately identified chemicals with significant morphological effects, including single-endpoint effects and multi-endpoint responses that would have been missed by univariate methods, while avoiding putative false-positives that confound traditional methods due to irregular correlation structure. By testing AggE in a variety of high-dimensional real and simulated datasets, we have characterized its performance and suggested implementation parameters that can guide its application across a wide range of experimental scenarios. © 2016.

TI  - Advancements in zebrafish applications for 21st century toxicology
AB  - The zebrafish model is the only available high-throughput vertebrate assessment system, and it is uniquely suited for studies of in vivo cell biology. A sequenced and annotated genome has revealed a large degree of evolutionary conservation in comparison to the human genome. Due to our shared evolutionary history, the anatomical and physiological features of fish are highly homologous to humans, which facilitates studies relevant to human health. In addition, zebrafish provide a very unique vertebrate data stream that allows researchers to anchor hypotheses at the biochemical, genetic, and cellular levels to observations at the structural, functional, and behavioral level in a high-throughput format. In this review, we will draw heavily from toxicological studies to highlight advances in zebrafish high-throughput systems. Breakthroughs in transgenic/reporter lines and methods for genetic manipulation, such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system, will be comprised of reports across diverse disciplines. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Leveraging Large-scale Behavioral Profiling in Zebrafish to Explore Neuroactive Polypharmacology
AB  - Many psychiatric drugs modulate the nervous system through multitarget mechanisms. However, systematic identification of multitarget compounds has been difficult using traditional in vitro screening assays. New approaches to phenotypic profiling in zebrafish can help researchers identify novel compounds with complex polypharmacology. For example, large-scale behavior-based chemical screens can rapidly identify large numbers of structurally diverse and phenotype-related compounds. Once these compounds have been identified, a systems-level analysis of their structures may help to identify statistically enriched target pathways. Together, systematic behavioral profiling and multitarget predictions may help researchers identify new behavior-modifying pathways and CNS therapeutics. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Purinergic and cholinergic drugs mediate hyperventilation in zebrafish: Evidence from a novel chemical screen
AB  - A rapid test to identify drugs that affect autonomic responses to hypoxia holds therapeutic and ecologic value. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a convenient animal model for investigating peripheral O2 chemoreceptors and respiratory reflexes in vertebrates; however, the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in this process are not adequately defined. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate purinergic and cholinergic control of the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia in zebrafish, and to develop a procedure for screening of neurochemicals that affect respiration. Zebrafish larvae were screened in multi-well plates for sensitivity to the cholinergic receptor agonist, nicotine, and antagonist, atropine; and to the purinergic receptor antagonists, suramin and A-317491. Nicotine increased ventilation frequency (fV) maximally at 100 μM (EC50 = 24.5 μM). Hypoxia elevated fV from 93.8 to 145.3 breaths min-1. Atropine reduced the hypoxic response only at 100 μM. Suramin and A- 317491 maximally reduced fV at 50 μM (EC50 = 30.4 and 10.8 μM) and abolished the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia. Purinergic P2X3 receptors were identified in neurons and O2-chemosensory neuroepithelial cells of the gills using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. These studies suggest a role for purinergic and nicotinic receptors in O2 sensing in fish and implicate ATP and acetylcholine in excitatory neurotransmission, as in the mammalian carotid body. We demonstrate a rapid approach for screening neuroactive chemicals in zebrafish with implications for respiratory medicine and carotid body disease in humans; as well as for preservation of aquatic ecosystems. © 2016 Rahbar et al.

TI  - Phenotype-based discovery of 2-[(E)-2-(Quinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenol as a novel regulator of ocular angiogenesis
AB  - Retinal angiogenesis is tightly regulated to meet oxygenation and nutritional requirements. In diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, uncontrolled angiogenesis can lead to blindness. Our goal is to better understand the molecular processes controlling retinal angiogenesis and discover novel drugs that inhibit retinal neovascularization. Phenotype-based chemical screens were performed using the ChemBridge DiversetTM library and inhibition of hyaloid vessel angiogenesis in Tg(fli1: EGFP) zebrafish. 2-[(E)-2-(Quinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenol, (quininib) robustly inhibits developmental angiogenesis at 4-10M in zebrafish and significantly inhibits angiogenic tubule formation in HMEC-1 cells, angiogenic sprouting in aortic ring explants, and retinal revascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. Quininib is well tolerated in zebrafish, human cell lines, and murine eyes. Profiling screens of 153 angiogenic and inflammatory targets revealed that quininib does not directly target VEGF receptors but antagonizes cysteinyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2 (CysLT1-2) at micromolar IC50 values. In summary, quininib is a novel anti-angiogenic small-molecule CysLT receptor antagonist. Quininib inhibits angiogenesis in a range of cell and tissue systems, revealing novel physiological roles for CysLT signaling. Quininib has potential as a novel therapeutic agent to treat ocular neovascular pathologies and may complement current anti-VEGF biological agents. ©2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

TI  - Tools for automating the imaging of zebrafish larvae
AB  - The VAST BioImager system is a set of tools developed for zebrafish researchers who require the collection of images from a large number of 2-7 dpf zebrafish larvae. The VAST BioImager automates larval handling, positioning and orientation tasks. Color images at about 10 μm resolution are collected from the on-board camera of the system. If images of greater resolution and detail are required, this system is mounted on an upright microscope, such as a confocal or fluorescence microscope, to utilize their capabilities. The system loads a larvae, positions it in view of the camera, determines orientation using pattern recognition analysis, and then more precisely positions to user-defined orientation for optimal imaging of any desired tissue or organ system. Multiple images of the same larva can be collected. The specific part of each larva and the desired orientation and position is identified by the researcher and an experiment defining the settings and a series of steps can be saved and repeated for imaging of subsequent larvae. The system captures images, then ejects and loads another larva from either a bulk reservoir, a well of a 96 well plate using the LP Sampler, or individually targeted larvae from a Petri dish or other container using the VAST Pipettor. Alternative manual protocols for handling larvae for image collection are tedious and time consuming. The VAST BioImager automates these steps to allow for greater throughput of assays and screens requiring high-content image collection of zebrafish larvae such as might be used in drug discovery and toxicology studies. © 2015 The Author.

TI  - Insights into mechanisms of central nervous system myelination using zebrafish
AB  - Myelin is the multi-layered membrane that surrounds most axons and is produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to its important role in enabling rapid nerve conduction, it has become clear in recent years that myelin plays additional vital roles in CNS function. Myelinating oligodendrocytes provide metabolic support to axons and active myelination is even involved in regulating forms of learning and memory formation. However, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how myelination by oligodendrocytes is regulated. The small tropical zebrafish has become an increasingly popular model organism to investigate many aspects of nervous system formation, function, and regeneration. This is mainly due to two approaches for which the zebrafish is an ideally suited vertebrate model-(1) in vivo live cell imaging using vital dyes and genetically encoded reporters, and (2) gene and target discovery using unbiased screens. This review summarizes how the use of zebrafish has helped understand mechanisms of oligodendrocyte behavior and myelination in vivo and discusses the potential use of zebrafish to shed light on important future questions relating to myelination in the context of CNS development, function and repair. GLIA 2016;64:333-349 Main points: The mechanisms of central nervous system myelination are not well understood. Zebrafish are an attractive vertebrate model for live cell imaging and target discovery to address how myelination by oligodendrocytes is regulated in vivo. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Systems pharmacology of hepatic metabolism in zebrafish larvae
AB  - Interspecies translation of pharmacological processes needs to improve to reduce attrition in drug development. Systems pharmacology integrates systems biology and pharmacometrics to characterise and quantify system-specific behaviour upon exposure to drugs in different species. The zebrafish is a suitable vertebrate model organism for systems pharmacology, combining high-throughput potential with high genetic homology to higher vertebrates. Zebrafish larvae have been increasingly used for drug screens, but the influence of internal drug and metabolite exposure is hardly studied. Quantifying this internal exposure is essential for establishing both exposure-response and dose-exposure relationships, needed for translation. The zebrafish may also serve as a suitable model species for translational studies on the occurrence of hepatotoxicity and the influence of hepatic dysfunction on drug metabolism. © 2017 The Author(s)

TI  - Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins regulate biliary-driven liver regeneration
AB  - Background & Aims During liver regeneration, hepatocytes are derived from pre-existing hepatocytes. However, if hepatocyte proliferation is compromised, biliary epithelial cells (BECs) become the source of new hepatocytes. We recently reported on a zebrafish liver regeneration model in which BECs extensively contribute to hepatocytes. Using this model, we performed a targeted chemical screen to identify important factors that regulate BEC-driven liver regeneration, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Methods Using Tg(fabp10a:CFP-NTR) zebrafish, we examined the effects of 44 selected compounds on BEC-driven liver regeneration. Liver size was assessed by fabp10a:DsRed expression; liver marker expression was analyzed by immunostaining, in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. Proliferation and apoptosis were also examined. Moreover, we used a mouse liver injury model, choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Results We identified 10 compounds that affected regenerating liver size. Among them, only bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors, JQ1 and iBET151, blocked both Prox1 and Hnf4a induction in BECs. BET inhibition during hepatocyte ablation blocked BEC dedifferentiation into hepatoblast-like cells (HB-LCs). Intriguingly, after JQ1 washout, liver regeneration resumed, indicating temporal, but not permanent, perturbation of liver regeneration by BET inhibition. BET inhibition after hepatocyte ablation suppressed the proliferation of newly generated hepatocytes and delayed hepatocyte maturation. Importantly, Myca overexpression, in part, rescued the proliferation defect. Furthermore, oval cell numbers in mice fed CDE diet were greatly reduced upon JQ1 administration, supporting the zebrafish findings. Conclusions BET proteins regulate BEC-driven liver regeneration at multiple steps: BEC dedifferentiation, HB-LC proliferation, the proliferation of newly generated hepatocytes, and hepatocyte maturation. © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB  - Target based chemical screens are a mainstay of modern drug discovery, but the effectiveness of this reductionist approach is being questioned in light of declines in pharmaceutical R & D efficiency. In recent years, phenotypic screens have gained increasing acceptance as a complementary/alternative approach to early drug discovery. We discuss the various model organisms used in phenotypic screens, with particular focus on zebrafish, which has emerged as a leading model of in vivo phenotypic screens. Additionally, we anticipate therapeutic opportunities, particularly in orphan disease space, in the context of rapid advances in human Mendelian genetics, electronic health record (EHR)-enabled genome–phenome associations, and genome editing. © 2016

TI  - Whole-Organism Cellular Pathology: A Systems Approach to Phenomics
AB  - Phenotype is defined as the state of an organism resulting from interactions between genes, environment, disease, molecular mechanisms, and chance. The purpose of the emerging field of phenomics is to systematically determine and measure phenotypes across biology for the sake of understanding. Phenotypes can affect more than one cell type and life stage, so ideal phenotyping would include the state of every cell type within the context of both tissue architecture and the whole organism at each life stage. In medicine, high-resolution anatomic assessment of phenotype is obtained from histology. Histology's interpretative power, codified by Virchow as cellular pathology, is derived from its ability to discern diagnostic and characteristic cellular changes in diseased tissues. Cellular pathology is observed in every major human disease and relies on the ability of histology to detect cellular change in any cell type due to unbiased pan-cellular staining, even in optically opaque tissues. Our laboratory has shown that histology is far more sensitive than stereomicroscopy for detecting phenotypes in zebrafish mutants. Those studies have also shown that more complete sampling, greater consistency in sample orientation, and the inclusion of phenotypes extending over longer length scales would provide greater coverage of common phenotypes. We are developing technical approaches to achieve an ideal detection of cellular pathology using an improved form of X-ray microtomography that retains the strengths and addresses the weaknesses of histology as a screening tool. We are using zebrafish as a vertebrate model based on the overlaps between zebrafish and mammalian tissue architecture, and a body size small enough to allow whole-organism, volumetric imaging at cellular resolution. Automation of whole-organism phenotyping would greatly increase the value of phenomics. Potential societal benefits would include reduction in the cost of drug development, a reduction in the incidence of unexpected severe drug and environmental toxicity, and more rapid elucidation of the contributions of genes and the environment to phenotypes, including the validation of candidate disease alleles identified in population and personal genetics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Identifying novel cancer therapies using chemical genetics and zebrafish
AB  - Chemical genetics is the use of small molecules to perturb biological pathways. This technique is a powerful tool for implicating genes and pathways in developmental programs and disease, and simultaneously provides a platform for the discovery of novel therapeutics. The zebrafish is an advantageous model for in vivo high-throughput small molecule screening due to translational appeal, high fecundity, and a unique set of developmental characteristics that support genetic manipulation, chemical treatment, and phenotype detection. Chemical genetic screens in zebrafish can identify hit compounds that target oncogenic processes— including cancer initiation and maintenance, metastasis, and angiogenesis—and may serve as cancer therapies. Notably, by combining drug discovery and animal testing, in vivo screening of small molecules in zebrafish has enabled rapid translation of hit anti-cancer compounds to the clinic, especially through the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs. Future technological advancements in automation and highpowered imaging, as well as the development and characterization of new mutant and transgenic lines, will expand the scope of chemical genetics in zebrafish. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Zebrafish discoveries in cancer epigenetics
AB  - The cancer epigenome is fundamentally different than that of normal cells. How these differences arise in and contribute to carcinogenesis is not known, and studies using model organisms such as zebrafish provide an opportunity to address these important questions. Modifications of histones and DNA comprise the complex epigenome, and these influence chromatin structure, genome stability and gene expression, all of which are fundamental to the cellular changes that cause cancer. The cancer genome atlas covers the wide spectrum of genetic changes associated with nearly every cancer type, however, this catalog is currently unidimensional. As the pattern of epigenetic marks and chromatin structure in cancer cells is described and overlaid on the mutational landscape, the map of the cancer genome becomes multi-dimensional and highly complex. Two major questions remain in the field: (1) how the epigenome becomes repatterned in cancer and (2) which of these changes are cancer-causing. Zebrafish provide a tractable in vivo system to monitor the epigenome during transformation and to identify epigenetic drivers of cancer. In this chapter, we review principles of cancer epigenetics and discuss recent work using zebrafish whereby epigenetic modifiers were established as cancer driver genes, thus providing novel insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming in cancer. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Allograft cancer cell transplantation in zebrafish
AB  - Allogeneic cell transplantation is the transfer of cells from one individual into another of the same species and has become an indispensable technique for studying development, immunology, regeneration and cancer biology. In experimental settings, tumor cell engraftment into immunologically competent recipients has greatly increased our understanding of the mechanisms that drive self-renewal, progression and metastasis in vivo. Zebrafish have quickly emerged as a powerful genetic model of cancer that has benefited greatly from allogeneic transplantation. Efficient engraftment can be achieved by transplanting cells into either early larval stage zebrafish that have not yet developed a functional acquired immune system or adult zebrafish following radiation or chemical ablation of the immune system. Alternatively, transplantation can be completed in adult fish using either clonal syngeneic strains or newly-generated immune compromised zebrafish models that have mutations in genes required for proper immune cell function. Here, we discuss the current state of cell transplantation as it pertains to zebrafish cancer and the available models used for dissecting important processes underlying cancer. We will also use the zebrafish model to highlight the power of cell transplantation, including its capacity to dynamically assess functional heterogeneity within individual cancer cells, visualize cancer progression and evolution, assess tumor-propagating potential and self-renewal, image cancer cell invasion and dissemination and identify novel therapies for treating cancer. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Here we discuss experimental approaches that range from cell lineage analysis to the imaging of synaptic calcium currents and atomic force microscopy. These methods are currently used in zebrafish to model morphogenetic events during early development of the eye primordium, cell fate decisions during retinal neurogenesis, and the differentiation and function of the many fine structural features that underlie the detection and processing of light stimuli in the eye. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish as a model for understanding enteric nervous system interactions in the developing intestinal tract
AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) forms intimate connections with many other intestinal cell types, including immune cells and bacterial consortia resident in the intestinal lumen. In this review, we highlight contributions of the zebrafish model to understanding interactions among these cells. Zebrafish is a powerful model for forward genetic screens, several of which have uncovered genes previously unknown to be important for ENS development. More recently, zebrafish has emerged as a model for testing functions of genes identified in human patients or large-scale human susceptibility screens. In several cases, zebrafish studies have revealed mechanisms connecting intestinal symptoms with other, seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes. Importantly, chemical library screens in zebrafish have provided startling new insights into potential effects of common drugs on ENS development. A key feature of the zebrafish model is the ability to rear large numbers of animals germ free or in association with only specific bacterial species. Studies utilizing these approaches have demonstrated the importance of bacterial signals for normal intestinal development. These types of studies also show how luminal bacteria and the immune system can contribute to inflammatory processes that can feedback to influence ENS development. The excellent optical properties of zebrafish embryos and larvae, coupled with the ease of generating genetically marked cells of both the host and its resident bacteria, allow visualization of multiple intestinal cell types in living larvae and should promote a more in-depth understanding of intestinal cell interactions, especially interactions between other intestinal cell types and the ENS. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Working with zebrafish at postembryonic stages
AB  - As the processes of embryogenesis become increasingly well understood, there is growing interest in the development that occurs at later, postembryonic stages. Postembryonic development holds tremendous potential for discoveries of both fundamental and translational importance. Zebrafish, which are small, rapidly and externally developing, and which boast a wealth of genetic resources, are an outstanding model of vertebrate postembryonic development. Nonetheless, there are specific challenges posed by working with zebrafish at these stages, and this chapter is meant to serve as a primer for those working with larval and juvenile zebrafish. Since accurate staging is critical for high-quality results and experimental reproducibility, we outline best practices for reporting postembryonic developmental progress. Emphasizing the importance of accurate staging, we present new data showing that rates of growth and size-stage relationships can differ even between wild-type strains. Finally, since rapid and uniform development is particularly critical when working at postembryonic stages, we briefly describe methods that we use to achieve high rates of growth and developmental uniformity through postembryonic stages in both wild-type and growth-compromised zebrafish. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tetragonula laeviceps cerumen was sequentially extracted with 80% (v/v) methanol, dichloromethane, and hexane and also in the reverse order. By the MTT assay and the respective 50% inhibition concentration value, the most active fraction was further purified to apparent homogeneity by bioassay-guided silica gel column chromatography. α-Mangostin was identified by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. It had a potent cytotoxicity against the BT474, Chago, Hep-G2, KATO-III, and SW620 cell lines (IC50 values of 1.22 ± 0.03, 2.25 ± 0.20, 0.94 ± 0.01, 0.88 ± 0.16, and 1.50 ± 0.39 µmol/L, respectively). The in vitro cytotoxicity of α-mangostin against the five human cancer cell lines and primary fibroblasts was further characterized by real-time impedance-based analysis. Interestingly, α-mangostin was more cytotoxic against the cancer-derived cell lines than against the primary fibroblasts. Later, the migration assay was performed by continuously measuring the attachment of cells to the plate electrodes at the bottom of the transwell membrane. The combined caspase-3 and -7 activities were assayed by the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 kit. It showed that the cytotoxic mechanism involved caspase-independent apoptosis, while at low (non-toxic) concentrations α-mangostin did not significantly alter cell migration. Furthermore, the in vivo cytotoxicity and angiogenesis were determined by alkaline phosphatase staining in zebrafish embryos along with monitoring changes in the transcript expression level of two genes involved in angiogenesis (vegfaa and vegfr2) by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction. It was found that the in vivo cytotoxicity of α-mangostin against zebrafish embryos had a 50% lethal concentration of 9.4 µM, but no anti-angiogenic properties were observed in zebrafish embryos at 9 and 12 µM even though it downregulated the expression of vegfaa and vegfr2 transcripts. Thus, α-mangostin is a major active compound with a potential anticancer activity in T. laeviceps cerumen in Thailand. © 2015, © 2015 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

TI  - Zebrafish: An Important Tool for Liver Disease Research
AB  - As the incidence of hepatobiliary diseases increases, we must improve our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and physiological factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of liver disease. Animal models help us identify disease mechanisms that might be targeted therapeutically. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have traditionally been used to study embryonic development but are also important to the study of liver disease. Zebrafish embryos develop rapidly; all of their digestive organs are mature in larvae by 5 days of age. At this stage, they can develop hepatobiliary diseases caused by developmental defects or toxin- or ethanol-induced injury and manifest premalignant changes within weeks. Zebrafish are similar to humans in hepatic cellular composition, function, signaling, and response to injury as well as the cellular processes that mediate liver diseases. Genes are highly conserved between humans and zebrafish, making them a useful system to study the basic mechanisms of liver disease. We can perform genetic screens to identify novel genes involved in specific disease processes and chemical screens to identify pathways and compounds that act on specific processes. We review how studies of zebrafish have advanced our understanding of inherited and acquired liver diseases as well as liver cancer and regeneration. © 2015 AGA Institute.

AB  - Regeneration involves interactions between multiple signaling pathways acting in a spatially and temporally complex manner. As signaling pathways are highly conserved, understanding how regeneration is controlled in animal models exhibiting robust regenerative capacities should aid efforts to stimulate repair in humans. One way to discover molecular regulators of regeneration is to alter gene/protein function and quantify effect(s) on the regenerative process: dedifferentiation/reprograming, stem/progenitor proliferation, migration/remodeling, progenitor cell differentiation and resolution. A powerful approach for applying this strategy to regenerative biology is chemical genetics, the use of small-molecule modulators of specific targets or signaling pathways. Here, we review advances that have been made using chemical genetics for hypothesis-focused and discovery-driven studies aimed at furthering understanding of how regeneration is controlled. © 2015 Future Science Ltd.

TI  - A high-throughput assay for quantifying appetite and digestive dynamics
AB  - Food intake and digestion are vital functions, and their dysregulation is fundamental for many human diseases. Current methods do not support their dynamic quantification on large scales in unrestrained vertebrates. Here, we combine an infrared macroscope with fluorescently labeled food to quantify feeding behavior and intestinal nutrient metabolism with high temporal resolution, sensitivity, and throughput in naturally behaving zebrafish larvae. Using this method and rate-based modeling, we demonstrate that zebrafish larvae match nutrient intake to their bodily demand and that larvae adjust their digestion rate, according to the ingested meal size. Such adaptive feedback mechanisms make this model system amenable to identify potential chemical modulators. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that nicotine, L-lysine, ghrelin, and insulin have analogous impact on food intake as in mammals. Consequently, the method presented here will promote large-scale translational research of food intake and digestive function in a naturally behaving vertebrate. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.

TI  - A Bmp reporter transgene mouse embryonic stem cell model as a tool to identify and characterize chemical teratogens
AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were first isolated from mouse embryos more than 30 years ago. They have proven invaluable not only in generating genetically modified mice that allow for analysis of gene function in tissue development and homeostasis but also as models for genetic disease. In addition, ESCs in vitro are finding inroads in pharmaceutical and toxicological testing, including the identification of teratogenic compounds. Here, we describe the use of a bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp)-reporter ESC line, isolated from a well-characterized transgenic mouse line, as a new tool for the identification of chemical teratogens. The Bmp-mediated expression of the green fluorescent protein enabled the quantification of dose- and time-dependent effects of valproic acid as well as retinoic acid. Significant effects were detectable at concentrations that were comparable to the ones observed in the classical embryonic stem cell test, despite the fact that the reporter gene is expressed in distinct cell types, including endothelial and endodermal cells. Thus these cells provide a valuable new tool for the identification and characterization of relevant mechanisms of embryonic toxicity. © The Author 2015.

TI  - New Zebrafish Models of Neurodegeneration
AB  - In modern biomedicine, the increasing need to develop experimental models to further our understanding of disease conditions and delineate innovative treatments has found in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) an experimental model, and indeed a valuable asset, to close the gap between in vitro and in vivo assays. Translation of ideas at a faster pace is vital in the field of neurodegeneration, with the attempt to slow or prevent the dramatic impact on the society’s welfare being an essential priority. Our research group has pioneered the use of zebrafish to contribute to the quest for faster and improved understanding and treatment of neurodegeneration in concert with, and inspired by, many others who have primed the study of the zebrafish to understand and search for a cure for disorders of the nervous system. Aware of the many advantages this vertebrate model holds, here, we present an update on the recent zebrafish models available to study neurodegeneration with the goal of stimulating further interest and increasing the number of diseases and applications for which they can be exploited. We shall do so by citing and commenting on recent breakthroughs made possible via zebrafish, highlighting their benefits for the testing of therapeutics and dissecting of disease mechanisms. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Characterization of optic nerve regeneration using transgenic zebrafish
AB  - In contrast to the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), fish are able to functionally regenerate severed axons upon injury. Although the zebrafish is a well-established model vertebrate for genetic and developmental studies, its use for anatomical studies of axon regeneration has been hampered by the paucity of appropriate tools to visualize re-growing axons in the adult CNS. On this account, we used transgenic zebrafish that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a GAP-43 promoter. In adult, naïve retinae, GFP was restricted to young retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Within the optic nerve, these fluorescent axons congregated in a distinct strand at the nerve periphery, indicating age-related order. Upon optic nerve crush, GFP expression was markedly induced in RGC somata and intra-retinal axons at 4 to at least 14 days post injury. Moreover, individual axons were visualized in their natural environment of the optic nerve using wholemount tissue clearing and confocal microscopy. With this novel approach, regenerating axons were clearly detectable beyond the injury site as early as 2 days after injury and grew past the optic chiasm by 4 days. Regenerating axons in the entire optic nerve were labeled from 6 to at least 14 days after injury, thereby allowing detailed visualization of the complete regeneration process. Therefore, this new approach could now be used in combination with expression knockdown or pharmacological manipulations to analyze the relevance of specific proteins and signaling cascades for axonal regeneration in vivo. In addition, the RGC-specific GFP expression facilitated accurate evaluation of neurite growth in dissociated retinal cultures. This fast in vitro assay now enables the screening of compound and expression libraries. Overall, the presented methodologies provide exciting possibilities to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying successful CNS regeneration in zebrafish. © 2015 Diekmann, Kalbhen and Fischer.

TI  - Zebrafish
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a cost-effective vertebrate model system amenable to pharmacological investigation. Many of the available drug assays are relatively straightforward to perform, as small molecules dissolved directly in the water can be directly taken up by the zebrafish to elicit biological effects in target tissues. The low cost and ease of drug administration have especially enabled the adoption of high-throughput pharmacological screening in whole, intact animals. In addition, a fully sequenced genome and numerous tools to manipulate genes allow for the rapid generation of zebrafish disease models. Finally, the high conservation between zebrafish and mammalian drug targets facilitates bringing zebrafish pharmacological discoveries into the clinic. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Pharmacological profiling of zebrafish behavior using chemical and genetic classification of sleep-wake modifiers
AB  - Sleep-wake states are impaired in various neurological disorders. Impairment of sleep-wake states can be an early condition that exacerbates these disorders. Therefore, treating sleep-wake dysfunction may prevent or slow the development of these diseases. Although many gene products are likely to be involved in the sleep-wake disturbance, hypnotics and psychostimulants clinically used are limited in terms of their mode of action and are not without side effects. Therefore, there is a growing demand for developing new hypnotics and psychostimulants with high efficacy and few side effects. Toward this end, animal models are indispensable for use in genetic and chemical screens to identify sleep-wake modifiers. As a proof-of-concept study, we performed behavioral profiling of zebrafish treated with chemical and genetic sleep-wake modifiers. We were able to demonstrate that behavioral profiling of zebrafish treated with hypnotics or psychostimulants from 9 to 10 days post-fertilization was sufficient to identify drugs with specific modes of action. We were also able to identify behavioral endpoints distinguishing GABA-A modulators and hypocretin (hcrt) receptor antagonists and between sympathomimetic and non-sympathomimetic psychostimulants. This behavioral profiling can serve to identify genes related to sleep-wake disturbance associated with various neuropsychiatric diseases and novel therapeutic compounds for insomnia and excessive daytime sleep with fewer adverse side effects. © 2015 Nishimura, Okabe, Sasagawa, Murakami, Ashikawa, Yuge, Kawaguchi, Kawase and Tanaka.

TI  - Green synthesis of reduced graphene oxide by a GRAS strain Bacillus subtilis 168 with high biocompatibility to zebrafish embryos
AB  - Low toxic and highly biocompatible graphene-based nanomaterials are in high demand within the biomedical fields. In this study, a highly biocompatible bacterially reduced graphene oxide (BRGO) was prepared by a "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) strain Bacillus subtilis 168 mediated with Vitamin K3 (VK3). The hypothesis of VK3 mediating electron transfer between succinate:quinine oxidoreductase, from B. subtilis 168, and graphene oxide (GO) was proposed. BRGO was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, XPS and XRD and showed excellent properties. Furthermore, BRGO illustrates greater biocompatibility, with less toxicity, than GO and chemically reduced graphene oxide (CRGO) by zebrafish toxicity assessment, which demonstrates its great potential in various biomedical applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

TI  - Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish
AB  - We describe a series of stages for development of the embryo of the zebrafish, Danio (Brachydanio) rerio. We define seven broad periods of embryogenesis—the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods. These divisions highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during the first 3 days after fertilization, and we review some of what is known about morphogenesis and other significant events that occur during each of the periods. Stages subdivide the periods. Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination. Photomicrographs and composite camera lucida line drawings characterize the stages pictorially. Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts. ©1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - The zebrafish reference genome sequence and its relationship to the human genome
AB  - Zebrafish have become a popular organism for the study of vertebrate gene function. The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Substantial information gathered from developmental and genetic research, together with near-completion of the zebrafish genome project, has placed zebrafish in an attractive position for use as a toxicological model. Although still in its infancy, there is a clear potential for zebrafish to provide valuable new insights into chemical toxicity, drug discovery, and human disease using recent advances in forward and reverse genetic techniques coupled with large-scale, high-throughput screening. Here we present an overview of the rapidly increasing use of zebrafish in toxicology.

TI  - Efficient multiplex biallelic zebrafish genome editing using a CRISPR nuclease system
AB  - A simple and robust method for targeted mutagenesis in zebrafish has long been sought. Previous methods generate monoallelic mutations in the germ line of F0 animals, usually delaying homozygosity for the mutation to the F2 generation. Generation of robust biallelic mutations in the F0 would allow for phenotypic analysis directly in injected animals. Recently the type II prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) system has been adapted to serve as a targeted genome mutagenesis tool. Herewe report an improved CRISPR/Cas system in zebrafish with custom guide RNAs and a zebrafish codon-optimized Cas9 protein that efficiently targeted a reporter transgene Tg(-5.1mnx1:egfp) and four endogenous loci (tyr, golden, mitfa, and ddx19). Mutagenesis rates reached 75-99%, indicating that most cells contained biallelic mutations. Recessive null-like phenotypes were observed in four of the five targeting cases, supporting high rates of biallelic gene disruption. We also observed efficient germ-line transmission of the Cas9-induced mutations. Finally, five genomic loci can be targeted simultaneously, resulting in multiple loss-of-function phenotypes in the same injected fish. This CRISPR/Cas9 system represents a highly effective and scalable gene knockout method in zebrafish and has the potential for applications in other model organisms.

TI  - Towards a comprehensive catalog of zebrafish behavior 1.0 and beyond
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly gaining popularity in translational neuroscience and behavioral research. Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

TI  - Reverse genetic screening reveals poor correlation between morpholino-induced and mutant phenotypes in zebrafish
AB  - The widespread availability of programmable site-specific nucleases now enables targeted gene disruption in the zebrafish. In this study, we applied site-specific nucleases to generate zebrafish lines bearing individual mutations in more than 20 genes. We found that mutations in only a small proportion of genes caused defects in embryogenesis. Moreover, mutants for ten different genes failed to recapitulate published Morpholino-induced phenotypes (morphants). The absence of phenotypes in mutant embryos was not likely due to maternal effects or failure to eliminate gene function. Consistently, a comparison of published morphant defects with theSanger Zebrafish Mutation Project revealed thatapproximately 80% of morphant phenotypes were not observed in mutant embryos, similar to our mutant collection. Based on these results, we suggest that mutant phenotypes become the standard metric to define gene function in zebrafish, afterwhich Morpholinos that recapitulate respective phenotypes could be reliably applied for ancillary analyses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in in zebrafish by homology-independent DNA repair
AB  - Sequence-specific nucleases like TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have greatly expanded the genome editing possibilities in model organisms such as zebrafish. Both systems have recently been used to create knock-out alleles with great efficiency, and TALENs have also been successfully employed in knock-in of DNA cassettes at defined loci via homologous recombination (HR). Here we report CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of DNA cassettes into the zebrafish genome at a very high rate by homology-independent double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. After co-injection of a donor plasmid with a short guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 nuclease mRNA, concurrent cleavage of donor plasmid DNA and the selected chromosomal integration site resulted in efficient targeted integration of donor DNA. We successfully employed this approach to convert eGFP into Gal4 transgenic lines, and the same plasmids and sgRNAs can be applied in any species where eGFP lines were generated as part of enhancer and gene trap screens. In addition, we show the possibility of easily targeting DNA integration at endogenous loci, thus greatly facilitating the creation of reporter and loss-of-function alleles. Due to its simplicity, flexibility, and very high efficiency, our method greatly expands the repertoire for genome editing in zebrafish and can be readily adapted to many other organisms. © 2014 Auer et al.

TI  - Locomotion in larval zebrafish: Influence of time of day, lighting and ethanol
AB  - The increasing use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in developmental research highlights the need for a detailed understanding of their behavior. We studied the locomotion of individual zebrafish larva (6 days post-fertilization) in 96-well microtiter plates. Movement was recorded using a video-tracking system. Time of day results indicated locomotion, tested in darkness (infrared), decreased gradually from early morning to a stable level between 13:00 and 15:30 h. All further studies were conducted in early-to-late afternoon and lasted approximately 1 h. Each study also began with a period of darkness to minimize any unintended stimulation caused by transferring the plates to the recording platform. Locomotion in darkness increased initially to a maximum at 4 min, then decreased steadily to a low level by 20 min. Locomotion during light was initially low and then gradually increased to a stable level after 20 min. When 10-min periods of light and dark were alternated, activity was low in light and high in dark; curiously, activity during alternating dark periods was markedly higher than originally obtained during either extended dark or light. Further experiments explored the variables influencing this alternating pattern of activity. Varying the duration of the initial dark period (10-20 min) did not affect subsequent activity in either light or dark. The activity increase on return to dark was, however, greater following 15 min than 5 min of light. Acute ethanol increased activity at 1 and 2% and severely decreased activity at 4%. One-percent ethanol retarded the transition in activity from dark to light, and the habituation of activity in dark, while 2% ethanol increased activity regardless of lighting condition. Collectively, these results show that locomotion in larval zebrafish can be reliably measured in a 96-well microtiter plate format, and is sensitive to time of day, lighting conditions, and ethanol.

TI  - Heritable and Precise Zebrafish Genome Editing Using a CRISPR-Cas System
AB  - We have previously reported a simple and customizable CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease (RGN) system that can be used to efficiently and robustly introduce somatic indel mutations in endogenous zebrafish genes. Here we demonstrate that RGN-induced mutations are heritable, with efficiencies of germline transmission reaching as high as 100%. In addition, we extend the power of the RGN system by showing that these nucleases can be used with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) to create precise intended sequence modifications, including single nucleotide substitutions. Finally, we describe and validate simple strategies that improve the targeting range of RGNs from 1 in every 128 basepairs (bps) of random DNA sequence to 1 in every 8 bps. Together, these advances expand the utility of the CRISPR-Cas system in the zebrafish beyond somatic indel formation to heritable and precise genome modifications. © 2013 Hwang et al.

TI  - A CRISPR/Cas9 vector system for tissue-specific gene disruption in zebrafish
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 technology of genome editing has greatly facilitated the targeted inactivation of genes invitro and invivo in a wide range of organisms. In zebrafish, it allows the rapid generation of knockout lines by simply injecting a guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. Here, we report a simple and scalable CRISPR-based vector system for tissue-specific gene inactivation in zebrafish. As proof of principle, we used our vector with the gata1 promoter driving Cas9 expression to silence the urod gene, implicated in heme biosynthesis, specifically in the erythrocytic lineage. Urod targeting yielded red fluorescent erythrocytes in zebrafish embryos, recapitulating the phenotype observed in the yquem mutant. While F0 embryos displayed mosaic gene disruption, the phenotype appeared very penetrant in stable F1 fish. This vector system constitutes a unique tool to spatially control gene knockout and greatly broadens the scope of loss-of-function studies in zebrafish. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Developmental origins of health and disease: Integrating environmental influences
AB  - There are now robust data supporting the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm. This includes human and animal data focusing on nutrition or environmental chemicals during development. However, the term DOHaD has not been generally accepted as the official term to be used when one is concerned with understanding the pathophysiological basis for how environmental influences acting during early development influence the risk of later noncommunicable diseases. Similarly, there is no global research or public health program built around the DOHaDparadigm that encompasses all aspects of environment. To better inform the global health efforts aimed at addressing the growing epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases of environmental origin, we propose a two-pronged approach: first, to make it clear that the current concept of DOHaD comprehensively includes a range of environmental factors and their relevance to disease occurrence not just throughout the life span but potentially across several generations; and second, to initiate the discussion of how adoption of DOHaD can promote a more realistic, accurate, and integrative approach to understanding environmental disruption of developmental programming and better inform clinical and policy interventions. © 2015 by the Endocrine Society.

TI  - Multidimensional in vivo hazard assessment using zebrafish
AB  - There are tens of thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment; The inherent safety of most of these chemicals is not known. Relevant biological platforms and new computational tools are needed to prioritize testing of chemicals with limited human health hazard information. We describe an experimental design for high-throughput characterization of multidimensional in vivo effects with the power to evaluate trends relating to commonly cited chemical predictors. We evaluated all 1060 unique U.S. EPA ToxCast phase 1 and 2 compounds using the embryonic zebrafish and found that 487 induced significant adverse biological responses. The utilization of 18 simultaneously measured endpoints means that the entire system serves as a robust biological sensor for chemical hazard. The experimental design enabled us to describe global patterns of variation across tested compounds, evaluate the concordance of the available in vitro and in vivo phase 1 data with this study, highlight specific mechanisms/value-added/ novel biology related to notochord development, and demonstrate that the developmental zebrafish detects adverse responses that would be missed by less comprehensive testing strategies. © The Author 2013.

TI  - Rapid reverse genetic screening using CRISPR in zebrafish
AB  - Identifying genes involved in biological processes is critical for understanding the molecular building blocks of life. We used engineered CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) to efficiently mutate specific loci in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and screen for genes involved in vertebrate biological processes. We found that increasing CRISPR efficiency by injecting optimized amounts of Cas9-encoding mRNA and multiplexing single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) allowed for phenocopy of known mutants across many phenotypes in embryos. We performed a proof-of-concept screen in which we used intersecting, multiplexed pool injections to examine 48 loci and identified two new genes involved in electrical-synapse formation. By deep sequencing target loci, we found that 90% of the genes were effectively screened. We conclude that CRISPR can be used as a powerful reverse genetic screening strategy in vivo in a vertebrate system. © 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development of a zebrafish embryo teratogenicity assay and quantitative prediction model
AB  - BACKGROUND: A zebrafish (Danio rerio) teratogenicity assay has been developed and evaluated for its ability to predict the teratogenic potential of chemicals. METHODS: Zebrafish embryos were dechorionated and then exposed to a test solution from 4-6 hours post-fertilization, and embryos or larvae were assessed up to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) for viability and morphology. In preliminary experiments, the potential time points for assessment of compoundinduced dysmorphology and general toxicity parameters were evaluated, and 5 dpf was found to be the optimum developmental stage for evaluation. Additionally, a morphological scoring system was devised to identify the developmental no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). For assay evaluation, 34 compounds with adequate in vivo developmental toxicity data were chosen. The compound set represented diversity in teratogenic potencies, structural classes, and pharmacologic targets. For 31 test compounds, each was evaluated over a concentration range, while 3 others were insufficiently aqueous-soluble to be fully tested. For each of the 31 tested compounds, the 5 dpf NOAEL was determined, and the concentration resulting in 25% lethality (LC25) was calculated by curve-fitting. Teratogenic potential of each compound was predicted based on the ratio of the LC25 to the NOAEL. LC25/NOAEL ratios of 10 or greater were considered predictive of teratogenicity. RESULTS: The model successfully categorized 87% of the compounds as teratogens or non-teratogens, with only 2 false-positives (dimethyl phthalate and a Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) investigative compound) and 2 false-negatives (valproic acid and a BMS compound). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this assay is promising for screening compounds for teratogenic potential. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish-As an integrative model for twenty-first century toxicity testing
AB  - The zebrafish embryo is a useful small model for investigating vertebrate development because of its transparency, low cost, transgenic and morpholino capabilities, conservation of cell signaling, and concordance with mammalian developmental phenotypes. From these advantages, the zebrafish embryo has been considered as an alternative model for traditional in vivo developmental toxicity screening. The use of this organism in conjunction with traditional in vivo developmental toxicity testing has the potential to reduce cost and increase throughput of testing the chemical universe, prioritize chemicals for targeted toxicity testing, generate predictive models of developmental toxicants, and elucidate mechanisms and adverse outcome pathways for abnormal development. This review gives an overview of the zebrafish embryo for pre dictive toxicology and 21st century toxicity testing. Developmental eye defects were selected as an example to evaluate data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ToxCast program comparing responses in zebrafish embryos with those from pregnant rats and rabbits for a subset of 24 environmental chemicals across >600 in vitro assay targets. Cross-species comparisons implied a common basis for biological pathways associated with neuronal defects, extracellular matrix remodeling, and mitotic arrest. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Development of a screening assay to identify teratogenic and embryotoxic chemicals using the zebrafish embryo
AB  - We developed and optimized a screening procedure, in which zebrafish embryos were explored as a model for the evaluation of the specific embryotoxic and teratogenic potential of chemicals. A selection of known positive (retinoic acid, valproic acid, caffeine, lithium chloride) and negative (glucose, saccharin) compounds for developmental toxicity were used to evaluate this method. We exposed embryos and evaluated embryotoxicity and morphological characteristics of the embryos at 24, 48, 72 and 144 h post fertilization. After evaluation of the induced effects, concentration-response curves were created for both embryotoxicity and teratogenic effects. Values for teratogenic indices (TI) were calculated as the ratio LC50/EC50. The results obtained were compared to existing data from studies with laboratory animals and humans. We demonstrated that our classification of the compounds, based on TI values, allows to distinguish teratogens from non-teratogens and supports the application of zebrafish embryos as an alternative method for developmental toxicity studies to predict effects in mammals. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Precise and efficient genome editing in zebrafish using the CRISPR/Cas9 system
AB  - The introduction of engineered site-specific DNA endonucleases has brought precise genome editing in many model organisms and human cells into the realm of possibility. In zebrafish, loss-of-function alleles have been successfully produced; however, germ line transmission of functional targeted knock-ins of protein tags or of SNP exchanges have not been reported. Here we show by phenotypic rescue that the CRISPR/Cas system can be used to target and repair a premature stop codon at the albino (alb) locus in zebrafish with high efficiency and precision. Using circular donor DNA containing CRISPR target sites we obtain close to 50% of larvae with precise homology-directed repair of the albb4 mutation, a small fraction of which transmitted the repaired allele in the germ line to the next generation (3/28 adult fish). The in vivo demonstration of germ line transmission of a precise SNP exchange in zebrafish underscores its suitability as a model for genetic research. © 2014.

TI  - Efficient generation of knock-in transgenic zebrafish carrying reporter/driver genes by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering
AB  - The type II bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system is rapidly becoming popular for genome-engineering due to its simplicity, flexibility, and high efficiency. Recently, targeted knock-in of a long DNA fragment via homology-independent DNA repair has been achieved in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 system. This raised the possibility that knock-in transgenic zebrafish could be efficiently generated using CRISPR/Cas9. However, how widely this method can be applied for the targeting integration of foreign genes into endogenous genomic loci is unclear. Here, we report efficient generation of knock-in transgenic zebrafish that have cell-type specific Gal4 or reporter gene expression. A donor plasmid containing a heat-shock promoter was co-injected with a short guide RNA (sgRNA) targeted for genome digestion, a sgRNA targeted for donor plasmid digestion, and Cas9 mRNA. We have succeeded in establishing stable knock-in transgenic fish with several different constructs for 4 genetic loci at a frequency being exceeding 25%. Due to its simplicity, design flexibility, and high efficiency, we propose that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in will become a standard method for the generation transgenic zebrafish.

AB  - In 2000, the first chemical screen using living zebrafish in a multi-well plate was reported. Since then, more than 60 additional screens have been published describing whole-organism drug and pathway discovery projects in zebrafish. To investigate the scope of the work reported in the last 14 years and to identify trends in the field, we analyzed the discovery strategies of 64 primary research articles from the literature. We found that zebrafish screens have expanded beyond the use of developmental phenotypes to include behavioral, cardiac, metabolic, proliferative and regenerative endpoints. Additionally, many creative strategies have been used to uncover the mechanisms of action of new small molecules including chemical phenocopy, genetic phenocopy, mutant rescue, and spatial localization strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Zebrafish in Toxicology and Environmental Health
AB  - As manufacturing processes and development of new synthetic compounds increase to keep pace with the expanding global demand, environmental health, and the effects of toxicant exposure are emerging as critical public health concerns. Additionally, chemicals that naturally occur in the environment, such as metals, have profound effects on human and animal health. Many of these compounds are in the news: lead, arsenic, and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A have all been widely publicized as causing disease or damage to humans and wildlife in recent years. Despite the widespread appreciation that environmental toxins can be harmful, there is limited understanding of how many toxins cause disease. Zebrafish are at the forefront of toxicology research; this system has been widely used as a tool to detect toxins in water samples and to investigate the mechanisms of action of environmental toxins and their related diseases. The benefits of zebrafish for studying vertebrate development are equally useful for studying teratogens. Here, we review how zebrafish are being used both to detect the presence of some toxins as well as to identify how environmental exposures affect human health and disease. We focus on areas where zebrafish have been most effectively used in ecotoxicology and in environmental health, including investigation of exposures to endocrine disruptors, industrial waste byproducts, and arsenic. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Precise in-frame integration of exogenous DNA mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 system in zebrafish
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a powerful tool for genome editing in various model organisms, including zebrafish. The establishment of targeted gene-disrupted zebrafish (knockouts) is readily achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification. Recently, exogenous DNA integration into the zebrafish genome via homology-independent DNA repair was reported, but this integration contained various mutations at the junctions of genomic and integrated DNA. Thus, precise genome modification into targeted genomic loci remains to be achieved. Here, we describe efficient, precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated integration using a donor vector harbouring short homologous sequences (10-40 bp) flanking the genomic target locus. We succeeded in integrating with high efficiency an exogenous mCherry or eGFP gene into targeted genes (tyrosinase and krtt1c19e) in frame. We found the precise in-frame integration of exogenous DNA without backbone vector sequences when Cas9 cleavage sites were introduced at both sides of the left homology arm, the eGFP sequence and the right homology arm. Furthermore, we confirmed that this precise genome modification was heritable. This simple method enables precise targeted gene knock-in in zebrafish. © 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Assessing locomotor activity in larval zebrafish: Influence of extrinsic and intrinsic variables
AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is evaluating methods to screen and prioritize large numbers of chemicals for developmental toxicity. We are exploring methods to detect developmentally neurotoxic chemicals using zebrafish behavior at 6. days of age. The behavioral paradigm simultaneously tests individual larval zebrafish under both light and dark conditions in a 96-well plate using a video tracking system. We have found that many variables affect the level or pattern of locomotor activity, including age of the larvae, size of the well, and the presence of malformations. Some other variables, however, do not appear to affect larval behavior including type of rearing solution (10% Hank's vs. 1:3 Danieau vs 60. mg/kg Instant Ocean vs 1× and 1:10× EPA Moderately Hard Water). Zebrafish larval behavior using a microtiter plate format may be an ideal endpoint for screening developmentally neurotoxic chemicals, but it is imperative that many test variables be carefully specified and controlled. © 2011.

TI  - Evolution of DOHaD: The impact of environmental health sciences
AB  - Environmental exposures have a significant influence on the chronic health conditions plaguing children and adults. Although the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm historically has focused on nutrition, an expanding body of research specifically communicates the effects of chemical exposures on early-life development and the propagation of non-communicable disease across the lifespan. This paper provides an overview of 20 years of research efforts aimed at identifying critical windows of susceptibility to environmental exposures and the signaling changes and epigenetic influences associated with disease progression. DOHaD grants funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in 1991, 2001 and 2011 are identified by grant-analysis software, and each portfolio is analyzed for exposures, disease endpoints, windows of exposure, study design and impact on the field based on publication data. Results show that the 1991 and 2001 portfolios comprised metals, PCBs and air pollutants; however, by 2011, the portfolio has evolved to include or expand the variety of endocrine disruptors, pesticides/persistent organic pollutants and metals. An assortment of brain-health endpoints is most targeted across the portfolios, whereas reproduction and cancer increase steadily over the same time period, and new endpoints like obesity are introduced by 2011. With mounting evidence connecting early-life exposures to later-life disease, we conclude that it is critical to expand the original DOHaD concept to include environmental chemical exposures, and to continue a research agenda that emphasizes defining sensitive windows of exposure and the mechanisms that cause disease. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2014.

TI  - Automated high-throughput neurophenotyping of zebrafish social behavior
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly becoming an important model organism in neuroscience research, representing an excellent species to study complex social phenotypes. Zebrafish actively form shoals, which can be used to quantify their shoaling behaviors, highly sensitive to various experimental manipulations. Recent advances in video-tracking techniques have enabled simultaneous tracking of multiple subjects, previously assessed by manual scoring of animal behavior. Here we examined the effect of group-size in the shoaling paradigm (ranging from 2 to 8 fish), and evaluated the ability of novel video-tracking tools to accurately track an entire shoal, compared to traditional manual analysis of shoaling phenotypes. To further validate our approach, the effects of the psychotropic drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 3,4-methlenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), as well as exposure to alarm pheromone, previously shown to affect zebrafish shoaling, were examined. Overall, a significant difference in group size was shown in the 2-fish vs. the 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-fish groups. Moreover, both LSD and MDMA treatments reduced shoaling (assessed by increased inter-fish distance) as well as proximity (time spent together) among fish. In contrast, exposure to alarm pheromone yielded an increase in shoaling and in proximity in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, a highly significant correlation for manual vs. automated analyses was revealed across all experiments. Collectively, this study further supports the utility of zebrafish to study social behavior, also demonstrating the capacity of video-tracking technology to assess zebrafish shoaling in a high-throughput and reliable manner. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, an engineered Cas9-VQR variant with 5′-NGA PAM specificities is used to induce base conversion in zebrafish. This shows that Cas9 variants can be used to expand the utility of this technology.

TI  - Zebrafish as a systems toxicology model for developmental neurotoxicity testing
AB  - The developing brain is extremely sensitive to many chemicals. Exposure to neurotoxicants during development has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Although rodents have been widely used for developmental neurotoxicity testing, experiments using large numbers of rodents are time-consuming, expensive, and raise ethical concerns. Using alternative non-mammalian animal models may relieve some of these pressures by allowing testing of large numbers of subjects while reducing expenses and minimizing the use of mammalian subjects. In this review, we discuss some of the advantages of using zebrafish in developmental neurotoxicity testing, focusing on central nervous system development, neurobehavior, toxicokinetics, and toxicodynamics in this species. We also describe some important examples of developmental neurotoxicity testing using zebrafish combined with gene expression profiling, neuroimaging, or neurobehavioral assessment. Zebrafish may be a systems toxicology model that has the potential to reveal the pathways of developmental neurotoxicity and to provide a sound basis for human risk assessments. © 2014 Japanese Teratology Society.

TI  - Zebrafish embryos and larvae in behavioural assays
AB  - Zebrafish embryos and early larvae are becoming increasingly important as models in biomedical research because of their low cost, high throughput and potential as a replacement for adult, higher vertebrate model species. The functional domains of drug targets, and other functionally important proteins, are often highly conserved between the zebrafish and mammals. Furthermore, the zebrafish embryo or larva shows a complex behavioural repertoire only a few days after fertilization. Here, we show how behavioural studies in mammals are being translated to the zebrafish embryo/larva model. We give emphasis to behavioural studies that may be relevant to drug screening or safety toxicology. We show how video tracking hardware and software can be used to provide an automated, high data-content readout for zebrafish behavioural responses. Published behavioural assays using zebrafish developmental stages include responses to dark challenge, acoustic stimuli, novel environments and various pharmacological compounds. Future prospects for zebrafish developmental behavioural studies include the potential to move from 96-well format studies into microfluidic-based embryo cultures. The zebrafish embryo model is already becoming a useful system for identifying molecular-genetic pathways associated with behavioural responses. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

TI  - Zebrafish Genome Engineering Using the CRISPR–Cas9 System
AB  - Geneticists have long sought the ability to manipulate vertebrate genomes by directly altering the information encoded in specific genes. The recently discovered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 endonuclease has the ability to bind single loci within vertebrate genomes and generate double-strand breaks (DSBs) at those sites. These DSBs induce an endogenous DSB repair response that results in small insertions or deletions at the targeted site. Alternatively, a template can be supplied, in which case homology-directed repair results in the generation of engineered alleles at the break site. These changes alter the function of the targeted gene facilitating the analysis of gene function. This tool has been widely adopted in the zebrafish model; we discuss the development of this system in the zebrafish and how it can be manipulated to facilitate genome engineering. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

As numerous zebrafish models become available with a wide spectrum of behavioral, genetic, and environmental methods to test novel drugs, here we discuss recent zebrafish phenomics methods to facilitate drug discovery, particularly in the field of biological psychiatry. Additionally, behavioral, neurological, and endocrine endpoints are becoming increasingly well-characterized in zebrafish, making them an inexpensive, robust and effective model for toxicology research and pharmacological screening. We also discuss zebrafish behavioral phenotypes, experimental considerations, pharmacological candidates and relevance of zebrafish neurophenomics to other 'omics' (e.g., genomic, proteomic) approaches.

TI  - Using zebrafish as a model system for studying the transgenerational effects of dioxin
AB  - 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been associated with many disease states in humans. A rising concern is that exposure early in life can lead to adult toxicity and toxicity in subsequent generations. Juvenile zebrafish exposed to TCDD (50 pg/ml in water; 1 h exposure) at 3 and 7 weeks post fertilization showed toxicity only later in adulthood. We have maintained the offspring of these exposed F0 fish to determine whether we could find adverse affects in the next two generations of F1 and F2 offspring. TCDD exposure produced a significantly higher female:male ratio in all three generations. Scoliosis-like axial skeleton abnormalities, not normally observed in controls, were present in the F1 and F2 generations descended from the treated F0 founders. Egg release and fertilization success were reduced in the TCDD lineage F1 and F2 generations. This reduction in fertility in the TCDD lineage F2 generation could be attributed to alterations in the F2 males. Using zebrafish as a model allowed the simultaneous maintenance of different generations with relatively small space and costs. The zebrafish showed clear signs of transgenerational responses persisting into generations never directly exposed to TCDD. © The Author 2014.

TI  - Identification of nonvisual photomotor response cells in the vertebrate hindbrain
AB  - Nonvisual photosensation enables animals to sense light without sight. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of nonvisual photobehaviors are poorly understood, especially in vertebrate animals. Here, we describe the photomotor response (PMR), a robust and reproducible series of motor behaviors in zebrafish that is elicited by visual wavelengths of light but does not require the eyes, pineal gland, or other canonical deep-brain photoreceptive organs. Unlike the relatively slow effects of canonical nonvisual pathways, motor circuits are strongly and quickly (seconds) recruited during thePMRbehavior.Wefind that the hindbrain is both necessary and sufficient to drive these behaviors. Using in vivo calcium imaging,weidentify a discrete set of neurons within the hindbrain whose responses to light mirror the PMR behavior. Pharmacological inhibition of the visual cycle blocks PMR behaviors, suggesting that opsin-based photoreceptors control this behavior. These data represent the first known light-sensing circuit in the vertebrate hindbrain. © 2013 the authors.

TI  - Transgenerational inheritance of neurobehavioral and physiological deficits from developmental exposure to benzo[a]pyrene in zebrafish
AB  - Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a well-known genotoxic polycylic aromatic compound whose toxicity is dependent on signaling via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). It is unclear to what extent detrimental effects of B[a]P exposures might impact future generations and whether transgenerational effects might be AHR-dependent. This study examined the effects of developmental B[a]P exposure on 3 generations of zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos were exposed from 6 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf) to 5 and 10 μM B[a]P and raised in chemical-free water until adulthood (F0). Two generations were raised from F0 fish to evaluate transgenerational inheritance. Morphological, physiological and neurobehavioral parameters were measured at two life stages. Juveniles of the F0 and F2 exhibited hyper locomotor activity, decreased heartbeat and mitochondrial function. B[a]P exposure during development resulted in decreased global DNA methylation levels and generally reduced expression of DNA methyltransferases in wild type zebrafish, with the latter effect largely reversed in an AHR2-null background. Adults from the F0 B[a]P exposed lineage displayed social anxiety-like behavior. Adults in the F2 transgeneration manifested gender-specific increased body mass index (BMI), increased oxygen consumption and hyper-avoidance behavior. Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene during development resulted in transgenerational inheritance of neurobehavioral and physiological deficiencies. Indirect evidence suggested the potential for an AHR2-dependent epigenetic route. © 2017 The Authors

TI  - Proposal for a tiered approach to developmental toxicity testing for veterinary pharmaceutical products for food-producing animals
AB  - In order to establish the safety of veterinary drug residues in human food, a number of toxicological evaluations are required, including the assessment of potential risks to development. In the light of the use of developmental toxicity testing for risk characterization, we evaluated whether conducting these tests in more than one species was redundant. Review of the published Summary Reports of recommendations of the EU Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products supplemented with data from the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) reports on veterinary drug residues in food identified 120 compounds, of which 105 had teratogenicity information in more than one species. The analysis of these compounds, representing a variety of chemical and pharmacological classes, provided justification for consideration of the use of a tiered approach for developmental toxicity evaluation of veterinary drugs for food-producing animals. The tiered approach begins with developmental toxicity testing in a rodent species, preferably the rat. If teratogenicity is observed, no testing in a second species would be required, except under specific circumstances where the ADI is determined based on the NOEL from this study. If a negative or an equivocal result for teratogenicity were observed in the rodent, then a developmental test in a second species, preferably the rabbit, would be conducted. The tiered approach provides thorough hazard identification, based on the use of a second species for compounds negative for teratogenicity in the rodent, and maintains maximum public protection based on the extremely low potential for human exposure to these compounds, while making a genuine attempt to limit unnecessary animal testing. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-in approaches in zebrafish
AB  - With its variety of applications, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has been rapidly evolving in the last few years. In the zebrafish community, knock-out reports are constantly increasing but insertion studies have been so far more challenging. With this review, we aim at giving an overview of the homologous directed repair (HDR)-based knock-in generation in zebrafish. We address the critical points and limitations of the procedure such as cutting efficiency of the chosen single guide RNA, use of cas9 mRNA or Cas9 protein, homology arm size etc. but also ways to circumvent encountered issues with HDR insertions by the development of non-homologous dependent strategies. While imprecise, these homology-independent mechanisms based on non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) repair have been employed in zebrafish to generate reporter lines or to accurately edit an open reading frame by the use of intron-targeting modifications. Therefore, with higher efficiency and insertion rate, NHEJ-based knock-in seems to be a promising approach to target endogenous loci and to circumvent the limitations of HDR whenever it is possible and appropriate. In this perspective, we propose new strategies to generate cDNA edited or tagged insertions, which once established will constitute a new and versatile toolbox for CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-ins in zebrafish. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Comparison of toxicity values across zebrafish early life stages and mammalian studies: Implications for chemical testing
AB  - With the high cost and slow pace of toxicity testing in mammals, the vertebrate zebrafish has become a tractable model organism for high throughput toxicity testing. We present here a meta-analysis of 600 chemicals tested for toxicity in zebrafish embryos and larvae. Nineteen aggregated and 57 individual toxicity endpoints were recorded from published studies yielding 2695 unique data points. These data points were compared to lethality and reproductive toxicology endpoints analyzed in rodents and rabbits and to exposure values for humans. We show that although many zebrafish endpoints did not correlate to rodent or rabbit acute toxicity data, zebrafish could be used to accurately predict relative acute toxicity through the rat inhalation, rabbit dermal, and rat oral exposure routes. Ranking of the chemicals based on toxicity and teratogenicity in zebrafish, as well as human exposure levels, revealed that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), benzo(a)pyrene, and chlorpyrifos ranked in the top nine of all chemicals for these three categories, and as such should be considered high priority chemicals for testing in higher vertebrates. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity: potential public health concerns
AB  - Throughout our lives, epigenetic processes shape our development and enable us to adapt to a constantly changing environment. Identifying and understanding environmentally induced epigenetic change(s) that may lead to adverse outcomes is vital for protecting public health. This review, therefore, examines the present understanding of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology. Many hundreds of studies have investigated such toxicity, yet relatively few have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and/or rodent models. While this small body of evidence is largely composed of exploratory in vivo high-dose range studies, it does set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity. Consequently, there is worldwide recognition of this phenomenon, and discussion on how to both guide further scientific research towards a greater mechanistic understanding of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in humans, and translate relevant research outcomes into appropriate regulatory policies for effective public health protection. © 2016, Crown Copyright 2016.

TI  - A novel 3D method of locomotor analysis in adult zebrafish: Implications for automated detection of CNS drug-evoked phenotypes
AB  - Background: Expanding the spectrum of organisms to model human brain phenotypes is critical for our improved understanding of the pathobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the clear limitations of existing mammalian models, there is an urgent need for low-cost, high-throughput in-vivo technologies for drug and gene discovery. New method: Here, we introduce a new automated method for generating 3D (X,Y,Z) swim trajectories in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), to improve their neurophenotyping. Results: Based on the Track3D module of EthoVision XT video tracking software (Noldus Information Technology), this tool enhances the efficient, high-throughput 3D analyses of zebrafish behavioral responses. Applied to adult zebrafish behavior, this 3D method is highly sensitive to various classes of psychotropic drugs, including selected psychostimulant and hallucinogenic agents. Comparison with existing Methods: Our present method offers a marked advance in the existing 2D and 3D methods of zebrafish behavioral phenotyping, minimizing research time and recording high-resolution, automatically synchronized videos with calculated, high-precision object positioning. Conclusions: Our novel approach brings practical simplicity and 'integrative' capacity to the often complex and error-prone quantification of zebrafish behavioral phenotypes. Illustrating the value of 3D swim path reconstructions for identifying experimentally-evoked phenotypic profiles, this method fosters innovative, ethologically relevant, and fully automated small molecule screens using adult zebrafish. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Understanding and Editing the Zebrafish Genome
AB  - In the last two decades, zebrafish has become one of the fastest growing model organisms in terms of publications, however it has been plagued with the absence of a key tool in the genetics toolbox: the ability to systematically make targeted mutations in the genome. That all changed with the recent emergence of custom-built, sequence-specific nucleases, i.e., zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), TAL-effector nucleases (TALENs), or clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the application of these genome-editing tools to generate targeted knockout and knock-in mutants in zebrafish. These technologies have allowed us to transition from targeted knockouts in zebrafish being a difficult, resource intensive undertaking, to something that can be done in virtually any lab with modest molecular biology experience. Furthermore, this review provides a comprehensive listing of genetic and genomic resources and online tools that zebrafish researchers can use to help find a desired mutation or design effective ZFNs, TALENs, or CRISPR guide RNAs for their targeting experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..

TI  - Zebrafish as a genetic model in pre-clinical drug testing and screening
AB  - The traditional drug discovery pipeline for the identification and development of compounds that selectively target specific molecules to ameliorate disease remains a major focus for medical research. However, the zebrafish is increasingly providing alternative strategies for various components of this pipeline. Zebrafish and their embryos are small, easily accessible and relatively low cost, making them applicable to high-throughput, small molecule screening. Zebrafish can also be manipulated by a range of forward and reverse genetics techniques to facilitate gene discovery and functional studies. Moreover, their physiological and developmental complexity provides accurate models of human disease to underpin mechanism of action and in vivo validation studies. Finally, several of these biological characteristics make zebrafish eminently suitable for toxicity testing, including eco-toxicology. Here we review the application of zebrafish to preclinical drug development and toxicity testing, including recent advances in mutant generation, drug screening and toxicology that serve to further enhance the capabilities of this valuable model organism in drug discovery. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Impacts of TCDD and MeHg on DNA methylation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) across two generations
AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether dioxin (TCDD) and methylmercury (MeHg) pose a threat to offspring of fish exposed to elevated concentrations of these chemicals via epigenetic-based mechanisms. Adult female zebrafish were fed diets added either 20 μg/kg 2,3,7,8 TCDD or 10 mg/kg MeHg for 47 days, or 10 mg/kg 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), a hypomethylating agent, for 32 days, and bred with unexposed males in clean water to produce F1 and F2 offspring. Global DNA methylation, promoter CpG island methylation and target gene transcription in liver of adult females and in 3 days post fertilization (dpf) F1 and F2 embryos were determined with HPLC, a novel CpG island tiling array containing 54,933 different probes and RT-qPCR, respectively. The results showed that chemical treatment had no significant effect on global DNA methylation levels in F1 (MeHg and TCDD) and F2 (MeHg) embryos and only a limited number of genes were identified with altered methylation levels at their promoter regions. CYP1A1 transcription, an established marker of TCDD exposure, was elevated 27-fold in F1 embryos compared to the controls, matching the high levels of CYP1A1 expression observed in F0 TCDD-treated females. This suggests that maternal transfer of TCDD is a significant route of exposure for the F1 offspring. In conclusion, the selected doses of TCDD and MeHg, two chemicals often found in high concentrations in fish, appear to have only modest effects on DNA methylation in F1 (MeHg and TCDD) and F2 (MeHg) embryos of treated F0 females. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish larvae are insensitive to stimulation by cocaine: Importance of exposure route and toxicokinetics
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae have been suggested as vertebrate model to complement or even replace mammals for rapidly assessing behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs. Yet, divergent responses have been reported in mammals and fish despite the conservation of many drug targets. Cocaine, eg, acts as stimulant in mammals but no such response has been documented for zebrafish larvae. We hypothesized that differences in exposure routes (inhalation or injection in mammals vs waterborne in fish) may be a reason for differences in behavioral responses. We characterized cocaine toxicokinetics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and found its rapid uptake into larvae. We used Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging for the first time to characterize internal distribution of cocaine in zebrafish larvae. Surprisingly, eyes accumulated the highest amount of cocaine and retained most of it even after 48h depuration. We attribute this to trapping by pigment melanin, a thus far little explored mechanism that may also be relevant for other basic drugs. Cocaine also reached the brain but with levels similar to those in trunk indicating simple passive diffusion as means of distribution which was supported by toxicokinetic models. Although brain levels covered those known to cause hyperactivity in mammals, only hypoactivity (decreased locomotion) was recorded in zebrafish larvae. Our results therefore point to cocaine's anesthetic properties as the dominant mechanism of interaction in the fish: upon entry through the fish skin and gills, it first acts on peripheral nerves rapidly overriding any potential stimulatory response in the brain. © The Author 2016.

TI  - Early dioxin exposure causes toxic effects in adult zebrafish
AB  - The acute effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure have been well documented in many vertebrate species. However, less is known about the consequences in adulthood from sublethal exposure during development. To address this, we exposed zebrafish to sublethal levels of TCDD (1 h; 50 pg/ ml), either in early embryogenesis (day 0) or during sexual determination (3 and 7 weeks), and assessed the effects later in adulthood. We found that exposure during embryogenesis produced few effects on the adults themselves but did affect the offspring of these fish: Malformations and increased mortality were observed in the subsequent generation. Zebrafish exposed during sexual development showed defects in the cranial and axial skeleton as adults. This was most clearly manifested as scoliosis caused by malformation of individual vertebrae. These fish also showed defects in reproduction, producing fewer eggs with lower fertilization success. Both males and females were affected, with males contributing to the decrease in egg release from the females and exposed females contributing to fertilization failure. TCDD exposure at 3 and 7 weeks produced feminization of the population. Surprisingly, part of this was due to the appearance of fish with clearly female bodies, yet carrying testes in place of ovaries. Our results show that exposures that produce little if any impact during development can cause severe consequences during adulthood and present a model for studying this process. © The Author 2013.

TI  - Cas9-based genome editing in Zebrafish
AB  - Genome editing using the Cas9 endonuclease of Streptococcus pyogenes has demonstrated unprecedented efficacy and facility in a wide variety of biological systems. In zebrafish, specifically, studies have shown that Cas9 can be directed to user-defined genomic target sites via synthetic guide RNAs, enabling random or homology-directed sequence alterations, long-range chromosomal deletions, simultaneous disruption of multiple genes, and targeted integration of several kilobases of DNA. Altogether, these methods are opening new doors for the engineering of knock-outs, conditional alleles, tagged proteins, reporter lines, and disease models. In addition, the ease and high efficiency of generating Cas9-mediated gene knock-outs provides great promise for high-throughput functional genomics studies in zebrafish. In this chapter, we briefly review the origin of CRISPR/Cas technology and discuss current Cas9-based genome-editing applications in zebrafish with particular emphasis on their designs and implementations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Meta-analysis of toxicity and teratogenicity of 133 chemicals from zebrafish developmental toxicity studies
AB  - Zebrafish developmental toxicity testing is an emerging field, which faces considerable challenges regarding data meta-analysis and the establishment of standardized test protocols. Here, we present an initial correlation study on toxicity of 133 chemicals based on data in the literature to ascertain predictive developmental toxicity endpoints. We found that the physical properties of chemicals (BCF or log. P) did not fully predict lethality or developmental outcomes. Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - PPTOX III: Environmental stressors in the developmental origins of disease-Evidence and mechanisms
AB  - Fetal and early postnatal development constitutes the most vulnerable time period of human life in regard to adverse effects of environmental hazards. Subtle effects during development can lead to functional deficits and increased disease risk later in life. The hypothesis stating that environmental exposures leads to altered programming and, thereby, to increased susceptibility to disease or dysfunction later in life has garnered much support from both experimental and epidemiological studies. Similar observations have been made on the long-term impact of nutritional unbalance during early development. In an effort to bridge the fields of nutritional and environmental developmental toxicity, the Society of Toxicology sponsored this work. This report summarizes novel findings in developmental toxicity as reported by select invited experts and meeting attendees. Recommendations for the application and improvement of current and future research efforts are also presented. © Published by Oxford University Press 2012.

TI  - Towards improved behavioural testing in aquatic toxicology: Acclimation and observation times are important factors when designing behavioural tests with fish
AB  - The quality and reproducibility of science has recently come under scrutiny, with criticisms spanning disciplines. In aquatic toxicology, behavioural tests are currently an area of controversy since inconsistent findings have been highlighted and attributed to poor quality science. The problem likely relates to limitations to our understanding of basic behavioural patterns, which can influence our ability to design statistically robust experiments yielding ecologically relevant data. The present study takes a first step towards understanding baseline behaviours in fish, including how basic choices in experimental design might influence behavioural outcomes and interpretations in aquatic toxicology. Specifically, we explored how fish acclimate to behavioural arenas and how different lengths of observation time impact estimates of basic swimming parameters (i.e., average, maximum and angular velocity). We performed a semi-quantitative literature review to place our findings in the context of the published literature describing behavioural tests with fish. Our results demonstrate that fish fundamentally change their swimming behaviour over time, and that acclimation and observational timeframes may therefore have implications for influencing both the ecological relevance and statistical robustness of behavioural toxicity tests. Our review identified 165 studies describing behavioural responses in fish exposed to various stressors, and revealed that the majority of publications documenting fish behavioural responses report extremely brief acclimation times and observational durations, which helps explain inconsistencies identified across studies. We recommend that researchers applying behavioural tests with fish, and other species, apply a similar framework to better understand baseline behaviours and the implications of design choices for influencing study outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The use of mrp1-deficient (Danio rerio) zebrafish embryos to investigate the role of Mrp1 in the toxicity of cadmium chloride and benzo[a]pyrene
AB  - Previous studies in our lab have revealed that both P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multi-resistance associated protein (Mrp) 1 played important roles in the detoxification of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in zebrafish embryos. This paper aims to extend this research by using mrp1-deficient model to illustrate the individual function of Mrp1. In this respect, CRISPR/Cas9 system was employed to generate a frameshift mutation in zebrafish mrp1 causing premature translational stops in Mrp1. Significant reduction on the efflux function of Mrps was found in mutant zebrafish embryos, which correlated well with the significantly enhanced accumulation and toxicity of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and benzo[a]pyrene (BαP), indicating the protective role of the corresponding protein. The different alteration on the accumulation and toxicity of Cd2+ and BαP could be attributed to the fact that Cd2+ and its metabolites were mainly excreted by Mrp1, while BαP was primarily pumped out by Pgp. More importantly, the compensation mechanism for the absence of Mrp1, including elevated glutathione (GSH) level and up-regulated expression of pgp and mrp2 were also found. Thus, mrp1-deficient zebrafish embryo could be a useful tool in the investigation of Mrp1 functions in the early life stages of aquatic organisms. However, compensation mechanism should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of results obtained with mrp1-deficient fish. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Early-life benzo[a]pyrene exposure causes neurodegenerative syndromes in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the mechanism involved
AB  - There is increasing recognition of the importance of early-life environmental exposures in health disorders at later-life stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early-life exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) could induce neurodegenerative syndromes at later-life stages in zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to BaP at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50nM from early embryogenesis to 96h post-fertilization (hpf), then transferred to clean water and maintained for 365 days. We found that BaP decreased locomotor and cognitive ability, neurotransmitter levels of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and norepinephrine; and induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and resulted in neurodegeneration. Additionally, BaP increased amyloid β protein and cell apoptosis in the adult zebrafish brain. Further, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3a were up-regulated in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. MeDIP-sequencing data of the 96 hpf larvae identified 235 differentially methylated genes in promoter, with the fold change > 1.5. Guanylate cyclase 2F (gucy2f) and dopamine receptor D4 related sequence (drd4-rs) were hypermethylation promoters, whereas zinc finger C4H2 domain (zc4h2) was a hypomethylation promoter in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. The mRNA levels of gucy2f and drd4-rs were down-regulated, and zc4h2 was up-regulated. Our findings suggested that the lasting modifications of DNA methylation were associated with neurodegenerative syndromes in adult zebrafish as a result of early-life BaP exposure. © The Author 2017.

TI  - Programmed effects in neurobehavior and antioxidative physiology in zebrafish embryonically exposed to cadmium: Observations and hypothesized adverse outcome pathway framework
AB  - Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major cause of premature mortality. Recent studies show that predispositions for NCDs may arise from early-life exposure to low concentrations of environmental contaminants. This developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) paradigm suggests that programming of an embryo can be disrupted, changing the homeostatic set point of biological functions. Epigenetic alterations are a possible underlying mechanism. Here, we investigated the DOHaD paradigm by exposing zebrafish to subtoxic concentrations of the ubiquitous contaminant cadmium during embryogenesis, followed by growth under normal conditions. Prolonged behavioral responses to physical stress and altered antioxidative physiology were observed approximately ten weeks after termination of embryonal exposure, at concentrations that were 50–3200-fold below the direct embryotoxic concentration, and interpreted as altered developmental programming. Literature was explored for possible mechanistic pathways that link embryonic subtoxic cadmium to the observed apical phenotypes, more specifically, the probability of molecular mechanisms induced by cadmium exposure leading to altered DNA methylation and subsequently to the observed apical phenotypes. This was done using the adverse outcome pathway model framework, and assessing key event relationship plausibility by tailored Bradford-Hill analysis. Thus, cadmium interaction with thiols appeared to be the major contributor to late-life effects. Cadmium-thiol interactions may lead to depletion of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine, resulting in methylome alterations, and may, additionally, result in oxidative stress, which may lead to DNA oxidation, and subsequently altered DNA methyltransferase activity. In this way, DNA methylation may be affected at a critical developmental stage, causing the observed apical phenotypes. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Molecular and chemical genetic approaches to developmental origins of aging and disease in zebrafish
AB  - The incidence of diseases increases rapidly with age, accompanied by progressive deteriorations of physiological functions in organisms. Aging-associated diseases are sporadic but mostly inevitable complications arising from senescence. Senescence is often considered the antithesis of early development, but yet there may be factors and mechanisms in common between these two phenomena over the dynamic process of aging. The association between early development and late-onset disease with advancing age is thought to come from a consequence of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of physiologically and/or morphologically adaptive states in response to different environmental or genetic perturbations. On the one hand, we hypothesized that the future aging process can be predictive based on adaptivity during the early developmental period. Modulating the thresholds of adaptive plasticity by chemical genetic approaches, we have been investigating whether any relationship exists between the regulatory mechanisms that function in early development and in senescence using the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a small freshwater fish and a useful model animal for genetic studies. We have successfully conducted experiments to isolate zebrafish mutants expressing apparently altered senescence phenotypes during embryogenesis ("embryonic senescence"), subsequently showing shortened lifespan in adulthoods. We anticipate that previously uncharacterized developmental genes may mediate the aging process and play a pivotal role in senescence. On the other hand, unexpected senescence-related genes might also be involved in the early developmental process and regulation. The ease of manipulation using the zebrafish system allows us to conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel genes and small molecular compounds that can be linked to the senescence phenotype, and thereby facilitates searching for the evolutionary and developmental origins of aging in vertebrates.

TI  - Histological and Transcriptomic Changes in Male Zebrafish Testes Due to Early Life Exposure to Low Level 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin
AB  - We have shown that zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an excellent model for evaluating the link between early life stage exposure to environmental chemicals and disease in adulthood and subsequent unexposed generations. Previously, we used this model to identify transgenerational effects of dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD]) on skeletal development, sex ratio, and reproductive capacity. Transgenerational inheritance of TCDD toxicity, notably decreased reproductive capacity, appears to be mediated through the male germ line. Thus, we examine testicular tissue for structural and gene expression changes using histology, microarray, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Histological analysis revealed decreased spermatozoa with concurrent increase in spermatogonia, and decreased germinal epithelium thickness in TCDD-exposed males compared with controls. We also identified altered expression of genes associated with testis development, steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis, hormone metabolism, and xenobiotic response. Altered genes are in pathways involving lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry, cell morphology, and metabolism of vitamins and minerals. These data will inform future investigations to elucidate the mechanism of adult-onset and transgenerational infertility due to TCDD exposure in zebrafish. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

TI  - Zebrafish locomotor responses reveal irritant effects of fine particulate matter extracts and a role for TRPA1
AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution causes adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes. Yet, the limited capacity to readily identify contributing PM sources and associated PM constituents in any given ambient air shed impedes risk assessment efforts. The health effects of PM have been attributed in part to its capacity to elicit irritant responses. A variety of chemicals trigger irritant behavior responses in zebrafish that can be easily measured. The purposes of this study were to examine the utility of zebrafish locomotor responses in the toxicity assessment of fine PM and its chemical fractions and uncover mechanisms of action. Locomotor responses were recorded in 6-day-old zebrafish exposed for 60min in the dark at 26 °C to the extractable organic matter of a compressor-generated diesel exhaust PM (C-DEP) and 4 of its fractions (F1-F4) containing varying chemical classes of increasing polarity. The role of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPA1, a chemical sensor in mammals and zebrafish, in locomotor responses to C-DEP, was also examined. Acrolein, an environmental irritant and known activator of TRPA1, and all extracts induced concentration-dependent locomotor responses whose potencies ranked as follows: polar F3 > weakly polar F2 > C-DEP > highly polar F4 > nonpolar F1, indicating that polar and weakly polar fractions that included nitro- and oxy-polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), drove C-DEP responses. Irritant potencies in fish positively correlated with mutagenic potencies of the same extracts in strains of Salmonella sensitive to nitro- and oxy-PAHs, further implicating these chemical classes in the zebrafish responses to CDEP. Pharmacologic inhibition of TRPA1 blocked locomotor responses to acrolein and the extracts. Taken together, these data indicate that the zebrafish locomotor assay may help expedite toxicity screening of fine PM sources, identify causal chemical classes, and uncover plausible biological mechanisms. © The Author 2017.

TI  - The rights and wrongs of zebrafish: Behavioral phenotyping of zebrafish
AB  - Animal models and tests have become increasingly important for biomedical research, enabling a better understanding of pathogenic pathways involved in various human disorders. Over the last decades, zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become a very popular model organism in biomedical research. Recently, this fish has entered the waters of neuroscience and biological psychiatry, quickly becoming an indispensable model species in this field. With a high genetic homology to humans ( 75% based on coding regions), it is not surprising that humans and fish are very similar physiologically (and behaviorally). Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that zebrafish can be an excellent model of human neuropsychiatric disorders. While some classical psychiatrists may not too easily be persuaded by this generalization, the current book "The rights and wrongs of zebrafish: principles of behavioral phenotyping and CNS disease modeling" explains, in a domain-by-domain manner, how exactly zebrafish models can be used to target a wide range of human brain disorders and aberrant phenotypes. The contributors to this book are leading international scholars whose work spearheads innovative zebrafish neuroscience research around the world. Written by top experts in the field, this book makes for a useful, balanced and up-to-date reading that outlines the use of zebrafish to study the pathological mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

TI  - Leveraging Embryonic Zebrafish to Prioritize ToxCast Testing
AB  - On the basis of two pilot high-content screens of ToxCast Phase I chemicals, we previously demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish embryos to abamectin and butafenacil abolished spontaneous activity and induced severe anemia, respectively. Therefore, the objective of this study was (1) to determine whether high-throughput in vitro screening data from the ToxCast program would have prioritized abamectin and butafenacil for further testing and (2) to determine whether a single three-day zebrafish embryo assay is a strong predictor of Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) scores derived from ToxCast data. Using publically available ToxCast assay end point data and target information, we calculated assay hit rates, developed hazard classifications, and relied on the ToxPi Graphical User Interface to generate ToxPi charts and scores within a biological process-driven configuration. Overall, our findings suggest that embryonic zebrafish may be valuable for prioritizing ToxCast testing as well as addressing toxicity pathways that may not be represented by the ToxCast assay battery. © 2015 American Chemical Society. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Maternal methylmercury from a wild-caught walleye diet induces developmental abnormalities in zebrafish
AB  - Maternal methylmercury (MeHg) exposure from a contaminated diet causes adverse effects in offspring, but the underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of maternal dietary MeHg-exposure on the offspring, using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system. Female zebrafish were exposed to MeHg (0.88–3.10 ppm) by consuming a diet made from wild-caught walleye originally intended for human consumption. While dietary MeHg exposure did not significantly influence fecundity, offspring showed increases in morphologic alterations and mortality, neurobehavioral dysfunction, and dysregulation of global gene expression. Gene expression analysis suggested that MeHg might affect neuronal and muscular development via dysregulation of genes related to transcriptional regulation (such as supt5h) and cell cycle (such as ccnb1). Results from this study provide evidence that food intended for human consumption, with relatively modest levels of MeHg, may induce adverse effects in offspring. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - How were new medicines discovered?
AB  - Preclinical strategies that are used to identify potential drug candidates include target-based screening, phenotypic screening, modification of natural substances and biologic-based approaches. To investigate whether some strategies have been more successful than others in the discovery of new drugs, we analysed the discovery strategies and the molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) for new molecular entities and new biologics that were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008. Out of the 259 agents that were approved, 75 were first-in-class drugs with new MMOAs, and out of these, 50 (67%) were small molecules and 25 (33%) were biologics. The results also show that the contribution of phenotypic screening to the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs exceeded that of target-based approaches with 28 and 17 of these drugs coming from the two approaches, respectively in an era in which the major focus was on target-based approaches. We postulate that a target-centric approach for first-in-class drugs, without consideration of an optimal MMOA, may contribute to the current high attrition rates and low productivity in pharmaceutical research and development. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Magic shotguns versus magic bullets: Selectively non-selective drugs for mood disorders and schizophrenia
AB  - Most common central nervous system disorders - such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia - seem to be polygenic in origin, and the most effective medications have exceedingly complex pharmacologies. Attempts to develop more effective treatments for diseases such as schizophrenia and depression by discovering drugs selective for single molecular targets (that is, 'magic bullets') have, not surprisingly, been largely unsuccessful. Here we propose that designing selectively non-selective drugs (that is, 'magic shotguns') that interact with several molecular targets will lead to new and more effective medications for a variety of central nervous system disorders.

TI  - Prostaglandin E2 regulates vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis
AB  - Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis is tightly controlled by growth factors, signalling molecules and transcription factors. Definitive HSCs derived during embryogenesis in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region subsequently colonize fetal and adult haematopoietic organs. To identify new modulators of HSC formation and homeostasis, a panel of biologically active compounds was screened for effects on stem cell induction in the zebrafish aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. Here, we show that chemicals that enhance prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis increased HSC numbers, and those that block prostaglandin synthesis decreased stem cell numbers. The cyclooxygenases responsible for PGE2 synthesis were required for HSC formation. A stable derivative of PGE2 improved kidney marrow recovery following irradiation injury in the adult zebrafish. In murine embryonic stem cell differentiation assays, PGE2 caused amplification of multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, ex vivo exposure to stabilized PGE2 enhanced spleen colony forming units at day 12 post transplant and increased the frequency of long-term repopulating HSCs present in murine bone marrow after limiting dilution competitive transplantation. The conserved role for PGE2 in the regulation of vertebrate HSC homeostasis indicates that modulation of the prostaglandin pathway may facilitate expansion of HSC number for therapeutic purposes. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Transparent Adult Zebrafish as a Tool for In Vivo Transplantation Analysis
AB  - The zebrafish is a useful model for understanding normal and cancer stem cells, but analysis has been limited to embryogenesis due to the opacity of the adult fish. To address this, we have created a transparent adult zebrafish in which we transplanted either hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells or tumor cells. In a hematopoiesis radiation recovery assay, transplantation of GFP-labeled marrow cells allowed for striking in vivo visual assessment of engraftment from 2 hr-5 weeks posttransplant. Using FACS analysis, both transparent and wild-type fish had equal engraftment, but this could only be visualized in the transparent recipient. In a tumor engraftment model, transplantation of RAS-melanoma cells allowed for visualization of tumor engraftment, proliferation, and distant metastases in as little as 5 days, which is not seen in wild-type recipients until 3 to 4 weeks. This transparent adult zebrafish serves as the ideal combination of both sensitivity and resolution for in vivo stem cell analyses. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dorsomorphin inhibits BMP signals required for embryogenesis and iron metabolism
AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals coordinate developmental patterning and have essential physiological roles in mature organisms. Here we describe the first known small-molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling-dorsomorphin, which we identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral axis formation in zebrafish. We found that dorsomorphin selectively inhibits the BMP type I receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and thus blocks BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, target gene transcription and osteogenic differentiation. Using dorsomorphin, we examined the role of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. In vitro, dorsomorphin inhibited BMP-, hemojuvelin- and interleukin 6-stimulated expression of the systemic iron regulator hepcidin, which suggests that BMP receptors regulate hepcidin induction by all of these stimuli. In vivo, systemic challenge with iron rapidly induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression in the liver, whereas treatment with dorsomorphin blocked SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, normalized hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels. These findings suggest an essential physiological role for hepatic BMP signaling in iron-hepcidin homeostasis. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - BMP type I receptor inhibition reduces heterotopic ossification
AB  - Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a congenital disorder of progressive and widespread postnatal ossification of soft tissues and is without known effective treatments. Affected individuals harbor conserved mutations in the ACVR1 gene that are thought to cause constitutive activation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2). Here we show that intramuscular expression in the mouse of an inducible transgene encoding constitutively active ALK2 (caALK2), resulting from a glutamine to aspartic acid change at amino acid position 207, leads to ectopic endochondral bone formation, joint fusion and functional impairment, thus phenocopying key aspects of human FOP. A selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-193189 (ref. 6), inhibits activation of the BMP signaling effectors SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in tissues expressing caALK2 induced by adenovirus specifying Cre (Ad.Cre). This treatment resulted in a reduction in ectopic ossification and functional impairment. In contrast to localized induction of caALK2 by Ad.Cre (which entails inflammation), global postnatal expression of caALK2 (induced without the use of Ad.Cre and thus without inflammation) does not lead to ectopic ossification. However, if in this context an inflammatory stimulus was provided with a control adenovirus, ectopic bone formation was induced. Like LDN-193189, corticosteroid inhibits ossification in Ad.Cre-injected mutant mice, suggesting caALK2 expression and an inflammatory milieu are both required for the development of ectopic ossification in this model. These results support the role of dysregulated ALK2 kinase activity in the pathogenesis of FOP and suggest that small molecule inhibition of BMP type I receptor activity may be useful in treating FOP and heterotopic ossification syndromes associated with excessive BMP signaling. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Small molecule developmental screens reveal the logic and timing of vertebrate development
AB  - Much has been learned about vertebrate development by random mutagenesis followed by phenotypic screening and by targeted gene disruption followed by phenotypic analysis in model organisms. Because the timing of many developmental events is critical, it would be useful to have temporal control over modulation of gene function, a luxury frequently not possible with genetic mutants. Here, we demonstrate that small molecules capable of conditional gene product modulation can be identified through developmental screens is zebrafish. We have identified several small molecules that specifically modulate various aspects of vertebrate ontogeny, including development of the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the neural crest, and the ear. Several of the small molecules identified allowed us to dissect the logic of melanocyte and otolith development and to identify critical periods for these events. Small molecules identified in this way offer potential to dissect further these and other developmental processes and to identify novel genes involved in vertebrate development.

TI  - Rapid behavior-based identification of neuroactive small molecules in the zebrafish
AB  - Neuroactive small molecules are indispensable tools for treating mental illnesses and dissecting nervous system function. However, it has been difficult to discover novel neuroactive drugs. Here, we describe a high-throughput, behavior-based approach to neuroactive small molecule discovery in the zebrafish. We used automated screening assays to evaluate thousands of chemical compounds and found that diverse classes of neuroactive molecules caused distinct patterns of behavior. These 'behavioral barcodes' can be used to rapidly identify new psychotropic chemicals and to predict their molecular targets. For example, we identified new acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors using phenotypic comparisons and computational techniques. By combining high-throughput screening technologies with behavioral phenotyping in vivo, behavior-based chemical screens can accelerate the pace of neuroactive drug discovery and provide small-molecule tools for understanding vertebrate behavior. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

TI  - Drugs that induce repolarization abnormalities cause bradycardia in zebrafish
AB  - Background - Drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes remain significant and often unpredictable clinical problems. Current in vitro preclinical assays are limited by biological simplicity, and in vivo models suffer from expense and low throughput. Methods and Results - During a screen for the effects of 100 small molecules on the heart rate of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, we found that drugs that cause QT prolongation in humans consistently caused bradycardia and AV block in the zebrafish. Of 23 such drugs tested, 18 were positive in this initial screen. Poor absorption explained 4 of 5 false-negative results, as demonstrated by microinjection. Overall, 22 of 23 compounds that cause repolarization abnormalities were positive in this assay, Antisense "knockdown" of the zebrafish KCNH2 ortholog yielded bradycardia in a dose dependent manner confirming the effects of reduction of repolarizing potassium current in this model. Classical drug-drug interactions between erythromycin and cisapride, as well as cimetidine and terfenadine, were also reproduced. Conclusion - This simple high-throughput assay is a promising addition to the repertoire of preclinical tests for drug-induced repolarization abnormalities. The genetic tractability of the zebrafish will allow the exploration of heritable modifiers of such drug effects.

TI  - DHODH modulates transcriptional elongation in the neural crest and melanoma
AB  - Melanoma is a tumour of transformed melanocytes, which are originally derived from the embryonic neural crest. It is unknown to what extent the programs that regulate neural crest development interact with mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human melanoma. We have used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF(V600E) (which encodes an amino acid substitution mutant of BRAF) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V600E) and lack p53 (also known as tp53) have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule suppressors of the neural crest lineage, which were then tested for their effects on melanoma. One class of compound, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for example leflunomide, led to an almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft studies. Taken together, these studies highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that have a direct bearing on melanoma formation. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

TI  - Chemical suppression of a genetic mutation in a zebrafish model of aortic coarctation
AB  - Conventional drug discovery approaches require a priori selection of an appropriate molecular target, but it is often not obvious which biological pathways must be targeted to reverse a disease phenotype. Phenotype-based screens offer the potential to identify pathways and potential therapies that influence disease processes. The zebrafish mutation gridlock (grl, affecting the gene hey2) disrupts aortic blood flow in a region and physiological manner akin to aortic coarctation in humans. Here we use a whole-organism, phenotype-based, small-molecule screen to discover a class of compounds that suppress the coarctation phenotype and permit survival to adulthood. These compounds function during the specification and migration of angioblasts. They act to upregulate expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the activation of the VEGF pathway is sufficient to suppress the gridlock phenotype. Thus, organism-based screens allow the discovery of small molecules that ameliorate complex dysmorphic syndromes even without targeting the affected gene directly.

TI  - Drug screening in Scn1a zebrafish mutant identifies clemizole as a potential Dravet syndrome treatment
AB  - Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with severe intellectual disability, impaired social development and persistent drug-resistant seizures. One of its primary monogenic causes are mutations in Na v 1.1 (SCN1A), a voltage-gated sodium channel. Here we characterize zebrafish Na v 1.1 (scn1Lab) mutants originally identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen. Mutants exhibit spontaneous abnormal electrographic activity, hyperactivity and convulsive behaviours. Although scn1Lab expression is reduced, microarray analysis is remarkable for the small fraction of differentially expressed genes (∼3%) and lack of compensatory expression changes in other scn subunits. Ketogenic diet, diazepam, valproate, potassium bromide and stiripentol attenuate mutant seizure activity; seven other antiepileptic drugs have no effect. A phenotype-based screen of 320 compounds identifies a US Food and Drug Administration-approved compound (clemizole) that inhibits convulsive behaviours and electrographic seizures. This approach represents a new direction in modelling pediatric epilepsy and could be used to identify novel therapeutics for any monogenic epilepsy disorder. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Rapid mutation of endogenous zebrafish genes using zinc finger nucleases made by oligomerized pool ENgineering (OPEN)
AB  - Background: Customized zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) form the basis of a broadly applicable tool for highly efficient genome modification. ZFNs are artificial restriction endonucleases consisting of a non-specific nuclease domain fused to a zinc finger array which can be engineered to recognize specific DNA sequences of interest. Recent proof-of-principle experiments have shown that targeted knockout mutations can be efficiently generated in endogenous zebrafish genes via non-homologous end-joining-mediated repair of ZFN-induced DNA double-stranded breaks. The Zinc Finger Consortium, a group of academic laboratories committed to the development of engineered zinc finger technology, recently described the first rapid, highly effective, and publicly available method for engineering zinc finger arrays. The Consortium has previously used this new method (known as OPEN for Oligomerized Pool ENgineering) to generate high quality ZFN pairs that function in human and plant cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that OPEN can also be used to generate ZFNs that function efficiently in zebrafish. Using OPEN, we successfully engineered ZFN pairs for five endogenous zebrafish genes: tfr2, dopamine transporter, telomerase, hif1aa, and gridlock. Each of these ZFN pairs induces targeted insertions and deletions with high efficiency at its endogenous gene target in somatic zebrafish cells. In addition, these mutations are transmitted through the germline with sufficiently high frequency such that only a small number of fish need to be screened to identify founders. Finally, in silico analysis demonstrates that one or more potential OPEN ZFN sites can be found within the first three coding exons of more than 25,000 different endogenous zebrafish gene transcripts. Conclusions and Significance: In summary, our study nearly triples the total number of endogenous zebrafish genes successfully modified using ZFNs (from three to eight) and suggests that OPEN provides a reliable method for introducing targeted mutations in nearly any zebrafish gene of interest. © 2009 Foley et al.

Recent work has shown that TALENs can induce mutations in endogenous zebrafish genes, but to date only four genes have been altered, and larger-scale tests of the success rate, mutation efficiencies and germline transmission rates have not been described. Here, we constructed homodimeric TALENs to 10 different targets in various endogenous zebrafish genes and found that 7 nuclease pairs induced targeted indel mutations with high efficiencies ranging from 2 to 76%. We also tested obligate heterodimeric TALENs and found that these nucleases induce mutations with comparable or higher frequencies and have better toxicity profiles than their homodimeric counterparts. Importantly, mutations induced by both homodimeric and heterodimeric TALENs are passed efficiently through the germline, in some cases reaching 100% transmission. For one target gene sequence, we observed substantially reduced mutagenesis efficiency for a variant site bearing two mismatched nucleotides, raising the possibility that TALENs might be used to perform allele-specific gene disruption. Our results suggest that construction of one to two heterodimeric TALEN pairs for any given gene will, in most cases, enable researchers to rapidly generate knockout zebrafish. © 2012 The Author(s).

TI  - Automated, quantitative screening assay for antiangiogenic compounds using transgenic zebrafish
AB  - Pathologic angiogenesis has emerged as an important therapeutic target in several major diseases. Zebrafish offer the potential for high-throughput drug discovery in a whole vertebrate system. We developed the first quantitative, automated assay for antiangiogenic compound identification using zebrafish embryos. This assay uses transgenic zebrafish with fluorescent blood vessels to facilitate image analysis. We developed methods for automated drugging and imaging of zebrafish in 384-well plates and developed a custom algorithm to quantify the number of angiogenic blood vessels in zebrafish. The assay was used to screen the LOPAC1280 compound library for antiangiogenic compounds. Two known antiangiogenic compounds, SU4312 and AG1478, were identified as hits. Additionally, one compound with no previously known antiangiogenic activity, indirubin-3′-monoxime (IRO), was identified. We showed that each of the hit compounds had dose-dependent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish. The IC50 of SU4312, AG1478, and IRO in the zebrafish angiogenesis assay was 1.8, 8.5, and 0.31 μmol/L, respectively. IRO had the highest potency of the hit compounds. Moreover, IRO inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation and proliferation (IC50 of 6.5 and 0.36 μmol/L, respectively). It is therefore the first antiangiogenic compound discovered initially in a zebrafish assay that also has demonstrable activity in human endothelial cell-based angiogenesis assays. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

TI  - Zebrafish chemical screening reveals an inhibitor of Dusp6 that expands cardiac cell lineages
AB  - The dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6) functions as a feedback regulator of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling to limit the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2. We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of Dusp6 - (E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3- dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (BCI) - using a transgenic zebrafish chemical screen. BCI treatment blocked Dusp6 activity and enhanced FGF target gene expression in zebrafish embryos. Docking simulations predicted an allosteric binding site for BCI within the phosphatase domain. In vitro studies supported a model in which BCI inhibits Dusp6 catalytic activation by ERK2 substrate binding. We used BCI treatment at varying developmental stages to uncover a temporal role for Dusp6 in restricting cardiac progenitors and controlling heart organ size. This study highlights the power of in vivo zebrafish chemical screens to identify new compounds targeting Dusp6, a component of the FGF signaling pathway that has eluded traditional high-throughput in vitro screens.

TI  - Identification of a new modulator of the intercalated disc in a zebrafish model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
AB  - Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is characterized by frequent cardiac arrhythmias. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms and discover potential chemical modifiers, we created a zebrafish model of ACM with cardiac myocyte-specific expression of the human 2057del2 mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin. A highthroughput screen identified SB216763 as a suppressor of the disease phenotype. Early SB216763 therapy prevented heart failure and reduced mortality in the fish model. Zebrafish ventricular myocytes that expressed 2057del2 plakoglobin exhibited 70 to 80% reductions in INa and IK1 current densities, which were normalized by SB216763. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes that expressed 2057del2 plakoglobin recapitulated pathobiological features seen in patients with ACM, all of which were reversed or prevented by SB216763. The reverse remodeling observed with SB216763 involved marked subcellular redistribution of plakoglobin, connexin 43, and Nav1.5, but without changes in their total cellular content, implicating a defect in protein trafficking to intercalated discs. In further support of this mechanism, we observed SB216763-reversible, abnormal subcellular distribution of SAP97 (a protein known to mediate forward trafficking of Nav1.5 and Kir2.1) in rat cardiac myocytes expressing 2057del2 plakoglobin and in cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from two ACM probands with plakophilin-2 mutations. These observations pinpoint aberrant trafficking of intercalated disc proteins as a central mechanism in ACM myocyte injury and electrical abnormalities.

TI  - A zebrafish compound screen reveals modulation of neutrophil reverse migration as an anti-inflammatory mechanism
AB  - Diseases of failed inflammation resolution are common and largely incurable. Therapeutic induction of inflammation resolution is an attractive strategy to bring about healing without increasing susceptibility to infection. However, therapeutic targeting of inflammation resolution has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular controls. To address this drug development challenge, we developed an in vivo screen for proresolution therapeutics in a transgenic zebrafish model. Inflammation induced by sterile tissue injury was assessed for accelerated resolution in the presence of a library of known compounds. Of the molecules with proresolution activity, tanshinone IIA, derived from a Chinese medicinal herb, potently induced inflammation resolution in vivo both by induction of neutrophil apoptosis and by promoting reverse migration of neutrophils. Tanshinone IIA blocked proinflammatory signals in vivo, and its effects are conserved in human neutrophils, supporting a potential role in treating human inflammation and providing compelling evidence of the translational potential of this screening strategy.

TI  - Diversity-oriented synthesis of biaryl-containing medium rings using a one bead/one stock solution platform
AB  - Diversity-oriented synthesis of structurally complex and diverse small molecules can be used as the first step in a process to explore cellular and organismal pathways. The success of this process is likely going to be dependent on advances in the synthesis of small molecules having natural product-like structures in an efficient and stereoselective manner. The development, scope, and mechanism of the oxidation of organocuprates was investigated and exploited in the atropdiastereoselective synthesis of biaryl-containing medium rings (9-, 10-, and 11-membered rings). The methodology was performed on high-capacity, large polystyrene beads by metalating aryl bromides with-iPrBu2MgLi, followed by transmetalating with CuCN·2LiBr and then oxidizing with 1,3-dinitrobenzene, and was used in a diversity-oriented synthesis of biaryl-containing medium rings (library total theoretical maximum 1412 members). The high capacity beads were arrayed into 384-well plates and, using a process optimized during the development of a one bead/one stock solution technology platform, converted into arrays of stock solutions, with each stock solution containing largely one compound. These stock solutions were used in numerous phenotypic and proteinbinding assays. The process described outlines a pathway that we feel will contribute to a comprehensive and systematic chemical approach to exploring biology (chemical genetics).

TI  - Identification of genetic and chemical modulators of zebrafish mechanosensory hair cell death
AB  - Inner ear sensory hair cell death is observed in the majority of hearing and balance disorders, affecting the health of more than 600 million people worldwide. While normal aging is the single greatest contributor, exposure to environmental toxins and therapeutic drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and antineoplastic agents are significant contributors. Genetic variation contributes markedly to differences in normal disease progression during aging and in susceptibility to ototoxic agents. Using the lateral line system of larval zebrafish, we developed an in vivo drug toxicity interaction screen to uncover genetic modulators of antibiotic-induced hair cell death and to identify compounds that confer protection. We have identified 5 mutations that modulate aminoglycoside susceptibility. Further characterization and identification of one protective mutant, sentinel (snl), revealed a novel conserved vertebrate gene. A similar screen identified a new class of drug-like small molecules, benzothiophene carboxamides, that prevent aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in zebrafish and in mammals. Testing for interaction with the sentinel mutation suggests that the gene and compounds may operate in different pathways. The combination of chemical screening with traditional genetic approaches is a new strategy for identifying drugs and drug targets to attenuate hearing and balance disorders. © 2008 Owens et al.

TI  - Phenothiazines induce PP2A-mediated apoptosis in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
AB  - T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC. Here, we performed 2 complementary screens to identify FDA-approved drugs and drug-like small molecules with activity against T-ALL. We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward MYC-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-ALL cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-ALL cells. Using ligand-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a perphenazine target. T-ALL cell lines treated with perphenazine exhibited rapid dephosphorylation of multiple PP2A substrates and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, shRNA knockdown of specific PP2A subunits attenuated perphenazine activity, indicating that PP2A mediates the drug's antileukemic activity. Finally, human T-ALLs treated with perphenazine exhibited suppressed cell growth and dephosphorylation of PP2A targets in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the recurring identification of phenothiazines as a class of drugs with anticancer effects. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic PP2A activation in T-ALL and other cancers driven by hyperphosphorylated PP2A substrates has therapeutic potential. © Copyright 2014 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

TI  - Chemical modifier screen identifies HDAC inhibitors as suppressors of PKD models
AB  - Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common human genetic disease with severe medical consequences. Although it is appreciated that the cilium plays a central role in PKD, the underlying mechanism for PKD remains poorly understood and no effective treatment is available. In zebrafish, kidney cyst formation is closely associated with laterality defects and body curvature. To discover potential drug candidates and dissect signaling pathways that interact with ciliary signals, we performed a chemical modifier screen for the two phenotypes using zebrafish pkd2hi4166 and ift172hi2211 models. pkd2 is a causal gene for autosomal dominant PKD and ift172 is essential for building and maintaining the cilium. We identified trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, as a compound that affected both body curvature and laterality. Further analysis verified that TSA inhibited cyst formation in pkd2 knockdown animals. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibiting class I HDACs, either by valproic acid (VPA), a class I specific HDAC inhibitor structurally unrelated to TSA, or by knocking down hdac1, suppressed kidney cyst formation and body curvature caused by pkd2 deficiency. Finally, we show that VPA was able to reduce the progression of cyst formation and slow the decline of kidney function in a mouse ADPKD model. Together, these data suggest body curvature may be used as a surrogate marker for kidney cyst formation in large-scale high-throughput screens in zebrafish. More importantly, our results also reveal a critical role for HDACs in PKD pathogenesis and point to HDAC inhibitors as drug candidates for PKD treatment.

TI  - Unraveling tissue regeneration pathways using chemical genetics
AB  - Identifying the molecular pathways that are required for regeneration remains one of the great challenges of regenerative medicine. Although genetic mutations have been useful for identifying some molecular pathways, small molecule probes of regenerative pathways might offer some advantages, including the ability to disrupt pathway function with precise temporal control. However, a vertebrate regeneration model amenable to rapid throughput small molecule screening is not currently available. We report here the development of a zebrafish early life stage fin regeneration model and its use in screening for small molecules that modulate tissue regeneration. By screening 2000 biologically active small molecules, we identified 17 that specifically inhibited regeneration. These compounds include a cluster of glucocorticoids, and we demonstrate that transient activation of the glucocorticoid receptor is sufficient to block regeneration, but only if activation occurs during wound healing/blastema formation. In addition, knockdown of the glucocorticoid receptor restores regenerative capability to nonregenerative, glucocorticoid-exposed zebrafish. To test whether the classical anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids is responsible for blocking regeneration, we prevented acute inflammation following amputation by antisense repression of the Pu.1 gene. Although loss of Pu.1 prevents the inflammatory response, regeneration is not affected. Collectively, these results indicate that signaling from exogenous glucocorticoids impairs blastema formation and limits regenerative capacity through an acute inflammation-independent mechanism. These studies also demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting chemical genetics to define the pathways that govern vertebrate regeneration. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

TI  - Inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein signaling attenuates anemia associated with inflammation
AB  - Anemia of inflammation develops in settings of chronic inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic disease. In this highly prevalent form of anemia, inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, stimulate hepatic expression of hepcidin, which negatively regulates iron bioavailability by inactivating ferroportin. Hepcidin is transcriptionally regulated by IL-6 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We hypothesized that inhibiting BMP signaling can reduce hepcidin expression and ameliorate hypoferremia and anemia associated with inflammation. In human hepatoma cells, IL-6-induced hepcidin expression, an effect that was inhibited by treatment with a BMP type I receptor inhibitor, LDN-193189, or BMP ligand antagonists noggin and ALK3-Fc. In zebrafish, the induction of hepcidin expression by transgenic expression of IL-6 was also reduced by LDN-193189. In mice, treatment with IL-6 or turpentine increased hepcidin expression and reduced serum iron, effects that were inhibited by LDN-193189 or ALK3-Fc. Chronic turpentine treatment led to microcytic anemia, which was prevented by concurrent administration of LDN-193189 or attenuated when LDN-193189 was administered after anemia was established. Our studies support the concept that BMP and IL-6 act together to regulate iron homeostasis and suggest that inhibition of BMP signaling may be an effective strategy for the treatment of anemia of inflammation. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.

TI  - Automated zebrafish chorion removal and single embryo placement: Optimizing Throughput of zebrafish developmental toxicity screens
AB  - The potential of the developing zebrafish model for toxicology and drug discovery is limited by inefficient approaches to manipulating and chemically exposing zebrafish embryos-namely, manual placement of embryos into 96- or 384-well plates and exposure of embryos while still in the chorion, a barrier of poorly characterized permeability enclosing the developing embryo. We report the automated dechorionation of 1600 embryos at once at 4 h postfertilization (hpf) and placement of the dechorionated embryos into 96-well plates for exposure by 6 hpf. The process removed ≥95% of the embryos from their chorions with 2% embryo mortality by 24 hpf, and 2% of the embryos malformed at 120 hpf. The robotic embryo placement allocated 6-hpf embryos to 94.7% ± 4.2% of the wells in multiple 96-well trials. The rate of embryo mortality was 2.8% (43 of 1536) from robotic handling, the rate of missed wells was 1.2% (18 of 1536), and the frequency of multipicks was <0.1%. Embryo malformations observed at 24 hpf occurred nearly twice as frequently from robotic handling (16 of 864; 1.9%) as from manual pipetting (9 of 864; 1%). There was no statistical difference between the success of performing the embryo placement robotically or manually. © 2012 Society for Laboratory.

TI  - Whole-organism screening for gluconeogenesis identifies activators of fasting metabolism
AB  - Improving the control of energy homeostasis can lower cardiovascular risk in metabolically compromised individuals. To identify new regulators of whole-body energy control, we conducted a high-throughput screen in transgenic reporter zebrafish for small molecules that modulate the expression of the fasting-inducible gluconeogenic gene pck1. We show that this in vivo strategy identified several drugs that affect gluconeogenesis in humans as well as metabolically uncharacterized compounds. Most notably, we find that the translocator protein ligands PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 are glucose-lowering agents despite a strong inductive effect on pck1 expression. We show that these drugs are activators of a fasting-like energy state and, notably, that they protect high-fat diet-induced obese mice from hepatosteatosis and glucose intolerance, two pathological manifestations of metabolic dysregulation. Thus, using a whole-organism screening strategy, this study has identified new small-molecule activators of fasting metabolism. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

Screening for modifiers of AML1-ETO-mediated hematopoietic dysregulation uncovered unexpected roles of COX-2- and β-catenin-dependent pathways in AML1-ETO function. This approach may open doors for developing therapeutics targeting oncogene function within leukemic stem cells.

TI  - Chemical modulation of memory formation in larval zebrafish
AB  - Whole organism-based small-molecule screens have proven powerful in identifying novel therapeutic chemicals, yet this approach has not been exploited to identify new cognitive enhancers. Here we present an automated high-throughput system for measuring nonassociative learning behaviors in larval zebrafish. Using this system, we report that spaced training blocks of repetitive visual stimuli elicit protein synthesis-dependent long-term habituation in larval zebrafish, lasting up to 24 h. Moreover, repetitive acoustic stimulation induces robust short-term habituation that can be modulated by stimulation frequency and instantaneously dishabituated through cross-modal stimulation. To characterize the neurochemical pathways underlying short-term habituation, we screened 1,760 bioactive compounds with known targets. Although we found extensive functional conservation of short-term learning between larval zebrafish and mammalian models, we also discovered several compounds with previously unknown roles in learning. These compounds included a myristic acid analog known to interact with Src family kinases and an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase 2, demonstrating that high-throughput chemical screens combined with high-resolution behavioral assays provide a powerful approach for the discovery of novel cognitive modulators.

TI  - Zebrafish screen identifies novel compound with selective toxicity against leukemia
AB  - To detect targeted antileukemia agents we have designed a novel, high-content in vivo screen using genetically engineered, T-cell reporting zebrafish.We exploited the developmental similarities between normal and malignant T lymphoblasts to screen a small molecule library for activity against immature T cells with a simple visual readout in zebrafish larvae. After screening 26 400 molecules, we identified Lenaldekar (LDK), a compound that eliminates immature T cells in developing zebrafish without affecting the cell cycle in other cell types. LDK is well tolerated in vertebrates and induces longterm remission in adult zebrafish withcMYC-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).LDKcauses dephosphorylation of members of the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and delays sensitive cells in late mitosis.Among human cancers, LDK selectively affects survival of hematopoietic malignancy lines and primary leukemias, including therapy-refractory B-ALL and chronic myelogenous leukemia samples, and inhibits growth of human T-ALL xenografts. This work demonstrates the utility of our method using zebrafish for antineoplastic candidate drug identification and suggests a new approach for targeted leukemia therapy. Although our efforts focused on leukemia therapy, this screening approach has broad implications as it can be translated to other cancer types involving malignant degeneration of developmentally arrested cells. © 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.

TI  - Rosuvastatin, identified from a zebrafish chemical genetic screen for antiangiogenic compounds, suppresses the growth of prostate cancer
AB  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in males in Western countries. Despite improvements in standard treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, many patients still progress to advanced stages. Recent clinical trials have shown encouraging results regarding the application of angiogenic inhibitors in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases, paving the way for novel PCa therapies. Objective: To identify new antiangiogenic compounds and examine their therapeutic potential in models of PCa. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a chemical genetic screen in developing zebrafish embryos to identify small molecules inhibiting zebrafish angiogenesis. Transgenic Tg(flk1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos were used in the screening of the Spectrum Collection compound library. Subsequently, the antiangiogenic mechanism of an identified lead compound, rosuvastatin, was studied by conducting endothelial cell function assays and examining antitumor efficacy in a PCa xenograft mouse model. Measurements, results and limitations: Seven lead compounds, including isorotenone, dihydromunduletone, aristolochic acid, simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin, were identified to inhibit the growth of the zebrafish intersegmental vessels. Of these seven leads, rosuvastatin was further evaluated for its antiangiogenic mechanism and anticancer efficacy. Rosuvastatin decreased the viability of the human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) (one-half inhibitory concentration: 5.87 μM) by inducing G1 phase arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, rosuvastatin remarkably inhibited the migration of HUVECs and dose-dependently inhibited the HUVEC capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rosuvastatin suppressed xenografted PPC-1 prostate tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice associated with decreased microvessel density (MVD) and tumor cell apoptosis. Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that rosuvastatin possesses antiangiogenic and antitumor activities and has therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa. This study represents the first zebrafish antiangiogenic chemical genetic screen to identify a lead compound that targets cancer angiogenesis. © 2010 European Association of Urology.

AB  - Zebrafish mutants have traditionally been obtained by using random mutagenesis or retroviral insertions, methods that cannot be targeted to a specific gene and require laborious gene mapping and sequencing. Recently, we and others have shown that customized zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) can introduce targeted frame-shift mutations with high efficiency, thereby enabling directed creation of zebrafish gene mutations. Here we describe a detailed protocol for constructing ZFN expression vectors, for generating and introducing ZFN-encoding RNAs into zebrafish embryos and for identifying ZFN-generated mutations in targeted genomic sites. All of our vectors and methods are compatible with previously described Zinc-Finger Consortium reagents for constructing engineered zinc-finger arrays. Using these methods, zebrafish founders carrying targeted mutations can be identified within 4 months. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Novel chemical suppressors of long QT syndrome identified by an in vivo functional screen
AB  - Background-: Genetic long QT (LQT) syndrome is a life-threatening disorder caused by mutations that result in prolongation of cardiac repolarization. Recent work has demonstrated that a zebrafish model of LQT syndrome faithfully recapitulates several features of human disease, including prolongation of ventricular action potential duration, spontaneous early afterdepolarizations, and 2:1 atrioventricular block in early stages of development. Because of their transparency, small size, and absorption of small molecules from their environment, zebrafish are amenable to high-throughput chemical screens. We describe a small-molecule screen using the zebrafish KCNH2 mutant breakdance to identify compounds that can rescue the LQT type 2 phenotype. Methods and results-: Zebrafish breakdance embryos were exposed to test compounds at 48 hours of development and scored for rescue of 2:1 atrioventricular block at 72 hours in a 96-well format. Only compounds that suppressed the LQT phenotype in 3 of 3 fish were considered hits. Screen compounds were obtained from commercially available small-molecule libraries (Prestwick and Chembridge). Initial hits were confirmed with dose-response testing and time-course studies. Optical mapping with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4 ANEPPS was performed to measure compound effects on cardiac action potential durations. Screening of 1200 small molecules resulted in the identification of flurandrenolide and 2-methoxy-N-(4-methylphenyl) benzamide (2-MMB) as compounds that reproducibly suppressed the LQT phenotype. Optical mapping confirmed that treatment with each compound caused shortening of ventricular action potential durations. Structure activity studies and steroid receptor knockdown suggest that flurandrenolide functions via the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. Conclusions-: Using a zebrafish model of LQT type 2 syndrome in a high-throughput chemical screen, we have identified 2 compounds, flurandrenolide and the novel compound 2-MMB, as small molecules that rescue the zebrafish LQT type 2 syndrome by shortening the ventricular action potential duration. We provide evidence that flurandrenolide functions via the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway. These 2 molecules and future discoveries from this screen should yield novel tools for the study of cardiac electrophysiology and may lead to novel therapeutics for human LQT patients.

TI  - Small molecule screen for compounds that affect vascular development in the zebrafish retina
AB  - Blood vessel formation in the vertebrate eye is a precisely regulated process. In the human retina, both an excess and a deficiency of blood vessels may lead to a loss of vision. To gain insight into the molecular basis of vessel formation in the vertebrate retina and to develop pharmacological means of manipulating this process in a living organism, we further characterized the embryonic zebrafish eye vasculature, and performed a small molecule screen for compounds that affect blood vessel morphogenesis. The screening of approximately 2000 compounds revealed four small molecules that at specific concentrations affect retinal vessel morphology but do not produce obvious changes in trunk vessels, or in the neuronal architecture of the retina. Of these, two induce a pronounced widening of vessel diameter without a substantial loss of vessel number, one compound produces a loss of retinal blood vessels accompanied by a mild increase of their diameter, and finally one other generates a severe loss of retinal vessels. This work demonstrates the utility of zebrafish as a screening tool for small molecules that affect eye vasculature and presents several compounds of potential therapeutic importance. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Inhibition of histone deacetylase expands the renal progenitor cell population
AB  - One of the first hallmarks of kidney regeneration is the reactivation of genes normally required during organogenesis. Identification of chemicals with the potential to enhance this reactivation could therapeutically promote kidney regeneration. Here, we found that 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid (PTBA) expanded the expression domains of molecular markers of kidney organogenesis in zebrafish. PTBA exhibits structural and functional similarity to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors 4-phenylbutanoic acid and trichostatin A; treatment with these HDAC inhibitors also expanded the renal progenitor cell population. Analyses in vitro and in vivo confirmed that PTBA functions as an inhibitor of HDAC activity. Furthermore, PTBA-mediated renal progenitor cell expansion required retinoic acid signaling. In summary, these results support a mechanistic link among renal progenitor cells, HDAC, and the retinoid pathway. Whether PTBA holds promise as a therapeutic agent to promote renal regeneration requires further study. Copyright © 2010 by the American Society of Nephrology.

TI  - Chemical screen identifies FDA-approved drugs and target pathways that induce precocious pancreatic endocrine differentiation
AB  - Pancreatic β-cells are an essential source of insulin and their destruction because of autoimmunity causes type I diabetes. We conducted a chemical screen to identify compounds that would induce the differentiation of insulin-producing β-cells in vivo. To do this screen, we brought together the use of transgenic zebrafish as a model of β-cell differentiation, a unique multiwell plate that allows easy visualization of lateral views of swimming larval fish and a library of clinical drugs. We identified six hits that can induce precocious differentiation of secondary islets in larval zebrafish. Three of these six hits were known drugs with a considerable background of published data on mechanism of action. Using pharmacological approaches, we have identified and characterized two unique pathways in β-cell differentiation in the zebrafish, including down-regulation of GTP production and retinoic acid biosynthesis.

TI  - Photochemical activation of TRPA1 channels in neurons and animals
AB  - Optogenetics is a powerful research tool because it enables high-resolution optical control of neuronal activity. However, current optogenetic approaches are limited to transgenic systems expressing microbial opsins and other exogenous photoreceptors. Here, we identify optovin, a small molecule that enables repeated photoactivation of motor behaviors in wild-type zebrafish and mice. To our surprise, optovin's behavioral effects are not visually mediated. Rather, photodetection is performed by sensory neurons expressing the cation channel TRPA1. TRPA1 is both necessary and sufficient for the optovin response. Optovin activates human TRPA1 via structure-dependent photochemical reactions with redox-sensitive cysteine residues. In animals with severed spinal cords, optovin treatment enables control of motor activity in the paralyzed extremities by localized illumination. These studies identify a light-based strategy for controlling endogenous TRPA1 receptors in vivo, with potential clinical and research applications in nontransgenic animals, including humans. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

TI  - Zebrafish model of the blood-brain barrier: morphological and permeability studies.
AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a monolayer of endothelial cells that is regulated by the proximity of a unique basement membrane and a tightly controlled molecular interaction between specialized subsets of cells including pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Working together, these cells form a neurovascular unit (NVU) that is dedicated to the local regulation of vascular function in the brain and BBB integrity. Accordingly, the intrinsic complexity of the cell-matrix-cell interactions of the NVU has made analyzing gene function in cell culture, tissue explants, and even animal models difficult and the inability to study gene function in the BBB in vivo has been a critical hurdle to advancing BBB research.Zebrafish has emerged as a premier vertebrate organism to model and analyze complex cellular interactions in vivo and genetic mechanisms of embryonic development. To this end, we provide a technical overview of the procedures that can be used in Zebrafish to analyze BBB integrity with a focus on the cerebrovasculature of adult fish where the BBB is now defined. The techniques that are used to measure the functional integrity, the cell biology, and the ultrastructure of the BBB include permeability assays, fluorescent imaging of reporter genes, and electron microscopy, respectively. Each can be applied to the functional analysis of mutant fish in ways that characterize the molecular sequelae to pathological insults that compromise BBB integrity. Due to the highly conserved nature of both the genetics and cell biology of zebrafish when compared with higher vertebrates, drug discovery techniques can be used in zebrafish models to complement drug development studies in other model systems.

TI  - Split - pool synthesis of 1,3-dioxanes leading to arrayed stock solutions of single compounds sufficient for multiple phenotypic and protein-binding assays
AB  - Diversity-oriented organic synthesis offers the promise of advancing chemical genetics, where small molecules are used to explore biology. While the split - pool synthetic method is theoretically the most effective approach for the production of large collections of small molecules, it has not been widely adopted due to numerous technical and analytical hurdles. We have developed a split-pool synthesis leading to an array of stock solutions of single 1,3-dioxanes. The quantities of compounds are sufficient for hundreds of phenotypic and protein-binding assays. The average concentration of these stock solutions derived from a single synthesis bead was determined to be 5.4 mM in 5 μL of DMSO. A mass spectrometric strategy to identify the structure of molecules from a split-pool synthesis was shown to be highly accurate. Individual members of the 1,3-dioxane library have activity in a variety of phenotypic and protein-binding assays. The procedure developed in this study allows many assays to be performed with compounds derived from individual synthesis beads. The synthetic compounds identified in these assays should serve as useful probes of cellular and organismal processes.

TI  - Identification of novel inhibitors of dietary lipid absorption using zebrafish
AB  - Pharmacological inhibition of dietary lipid absorption induces favorable changes in serum lipoprotein levels in patients that are at risk for cardiovascular disease and is considered an adjuvant or alternative treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying novel inhibitors of intestinal lipid absorption using the zebrafish system. A pilot screen of an unbiased chemical library identified novel compounds that inhibited processing of fluorescent lipid analogues in live zebrafish larvae. Secondary assays identified those compounds suitable for testing in mammals and provided insight into mechanism of action, which for several compounds could be distinguished from ezetimibe, a drug used to inhibit cholesterol absorption in humans that broadly inhibited lipid absorption in zebrafish larvae. These findings support the utility of zebrafish screening assays to identify novel compounds that target complex physiological processes. © 2010 Clifton et al.

TI  - Design and synthesis of novel xyloketal derivatives and their vasorelaxing activities in rat thoracic aorta and angiogenic activities in zebrafish angiogenesis screen
AB  - A novel series of xyloketal derivatives (1-21) were designed and prepared. The majority of the compounds demonstrated vasorelaxation action on 60 mM KCl-induced contractions rat isolated aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner, and the action is mediated by both endothelium-independent and endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Compounds 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 19 showed higher vasorelaxation activities comparing with the lead compound 3. In addition, these derivatives had potential protective action against oxLDL-induced endothelial oxidative injury and enhanced NO production in HUVECs without toxic effects. The NO release was completely inhibited by eNOS inhibitor L-NAME. Furthermore, 3 significantly promoted the angiogenesis in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner at 0.1, 1, and 10 μM. Compounds 9, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 21 exhibited stronger angiogenic activities than 3. Therefore, xyloketal derivatives are unique compounds with multiple pharmacological properties and may have potential implications in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

TI  - High-throughput hyperdimensional vertebrate phenotyping
AB  - Most gene mutations and biologically active molecules cause complex responses in animals that cannot be predicted by cell culture models. Yet animal studies remain too slow and their analyses are often limited to only a few readouts. Here we demonstrate high-throughput optical projection tomography with micrometre resolution and hyperdimensional screening of entire vertebrates in tens of seconds using a simple fluidic system. Hundreds of independent morphological features and complex phenotypes are automatically captured in three dimensions with unprecedented speed and detail in semitransparent zebrafish larvae. By clustering quantitative phenotypic signatures, we can detect and classify even subtle alterations in many biological processes simultaneously. We term our approach hyperdimensional in vivo phenotyping. To illustrate the power of hyperdimensional in vivo phenotyping, we have analysed the effects of several classes of teratogens on cartilage formation using 200 independent morphological measurements, and identified similarities and differences that correlate well with their known mechanisms of actions in mammals. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Selective inhibition of retinal angiogenesis by targeting PI3 kinase
AB  - Ocular neovascularisation is a pathological hallmark of some forms of debilitating blindness including diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration and retinopathy of prematurity. Current therapies for delaying unwanted ocular angiogenesis include laser surgery or molecular inhibition of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. However, targeting of angiogenic pathways other than, or in combination to VEGF, may lead to more effective and safer inhibitors of intraocular angiogenesis. In a small chemical screen using zebrafish, we identify LY294002 as an effective and selective inhibitor of both developmental and ectopic hyaloid angiogenesis in the eye. LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, exerts its anti-angiogenic effect in a dose-dependent manner, without perturbing existing vessels. Significantly, LY294002 delivered by intraocular injection, significantly inhibits ocular angiogenesis without systemic side-effects and without diminishing visual function. Thus, targeting of PI3 kinase pathways has the potential to effectively and safely treat neovascularisation in eye disease. © 2009 Alvarez et al.

TI  - Whole organism high content screening identifies stimulators of pancreatic beta-cell proliferation
AB  - Inducing beta-cell mass expansion in diabetic patients with the aim to restore glucose homeostasis is a promising therapeutic strategy. Although several in vitro studies have been carried out to identify modulators of beta-cell mass expansion, restoring endogenous beta-cell mass in vivo has yet to be achieved. To identify potential stimulators of beta-cell replication in vivo, we established transgenic zebrafish lines that monitor and allow the quantification of cell proliferation by using the fluorescent ubiquitylation-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) technology. Using these new reagents, we performed an unbiased chemical screen, and identified 20 small molecules that markedly increased beta-cell proliferation in vivo. Importantly, these structurally distinct molecules, which include clinically-approved drugs, modulate three specific signaling pathways: serotonin, retinoic acid and glucocorticoids, showing the high sensitivity and robustness of our screen. Notably, two drug classes, retinoic acid and glucocorticoids, also promoted beta-cell regeneration after beta-cell ablation. Thus, this study establishes a proof of principle for a high-throughput small molecule-screen for beta-cell proliferation in vivo, and identified compounds that stimulate beta-cell proliferation and regeneration. © 2014 Tsuji et al.

TI  - Identification of a novel retinoid by small molecule screening with zebrafish embryos
AB  - Small molecules have played an important role in delineating molecular pathways involved in embryonic development and disease pathology. The need for novel small molecule modulators of biological processes has driven a number of targeted screens on large diverse libraries. However, due to the specific focus of such screens, the majority of the bioactive potential of these libraries remains unharnessed. In order to identify a higher proportion of compounds with interesting biological activities, we screened a diverse synthetic library for compounds that perturb the development of any of the multiple organs in zebrafish embryos. We identified small molecules that affect the development of a variety of structures such as heart, vasculature, brain, and body-axis. We utilized the previously known role of retinoic acid in anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning to identify the target of DTAB, a compound that caused A-P axis shortening in the zebrafish embryo. We show that DTAR is a retinoid with selective activity towards retinoic acid receptors γ and β. Thus, conducting zebrafish developmental screens using small molecules will not only enable the identification of compounds with diverse biological activities in a large chemical library but may also facilitate the identification of the target pathways of these biologically active molecules. © 2008 Sachidanandan et al.

TI  - Selective small molecule targeting β-catenin function discovered by in vivo chemical genetic screen
AB  - The canonical Wnt signaling pathway, mediated by the transcription factor β-catenin, plays critical roles in embryonic development and represents an important therapeutic target. In a zebrafish-based invivo screen for small molecules that specifically perturb embryonic dorsoventral patterning, we discovered a compound named windorphen that selectively blocks the Wnt signal required for ventral development. Windorphen exhibits remarkable specificity toward β-catenin-1 function, indicating that the two β-catenin isoforms found in zebrafish are not functionally redundant. We show that windorphen is a selective inhibitor of p300 histone acetyltransferase, a coactivator that associates with β-catenin. Finally, windorphen robustly and selectively kills cancer cells that harbor Wnt-activating mutations, supporting the therapeutic potential of this Wnt inhibitor class

TI  - A novel chemical screening strategy in zebrafish identifies common pathways in embryogenesis and rhabdomyosarcoma development
AB  - The zebrafish is a powerful genetic model that has only recently been used to dissect developmental pathways involved in oncogenesis. We hypothesized that operative pathways during embryogenesis would also be used for oncogenesis. In an effort to define RAS target genes during embryogenesis, gene expression was evaluated in Tg(hsp70-HRASG12V) zebrafish embryos subjected to heat shock. dusp6 was activated by RAS, and this was used as the basis for a chemical genetic screen to identify small molecules that interfere with RAS signaling during embryogenesis. A KRASG12D-induced zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was then used to assess the therapeutic effects of the small molecules. Two of these inhibitors, PD98059 and TPCK, had anti-tumor activity as single agents in both zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and a human cell line of rhabdomyosarcoma that harbored activated mutations in NRAS. PD98059 inhibited MEK1 whereas TPCK suppressed S6K1 activity; however, the combined treatment completely suppressed eIF4B phosphorylation and decreased translation initiation. Our work demonstrates that the activated pathways in RAS induction during embryogenesis are also important in oncogenesis and that inhibition of these pathways suppresses tumor growth. © 2013.

Two compounds, budesonide and AGN192403, abrogated fin regeneration. One compound in particular, AGN192403, targets the imidazoline receptor, a pathway not previously linked to fin regeneration. In addition to inhibiting regeneration of the adult fin, AGN192403 also blocked regeneration of the larval fin fold. Finally, the inhibitory effect of AGN192403 on fin regeneration persisted after removal of the drug.

TI  - Generation of orientation tools for automated zebrafish screening assays using desktop 3D printing
AB  - Background: The zebrafish has been established as the main vertebrate model system for whole organism screening applications. However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools.Results: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop 3D printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns.Conclusions: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding 3D models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3D printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users. Finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods. © 2014 Wittbrodt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Identification of the F1F0 mitochondrial ATPase as a target for modulating skin pigmentation by screening a tagged triazine library in zebrafish
AB  - A triazine-based combinatorial library of small molecules was screened in zebrafish to identify compounds that produced interesting phenotypes. One compound (of 1536 screened) induced a dramatic increase in the pigmentation of early stage zebrafish embryos. This compound, PPA, was also found to increase pigmentation in cultured mammalian melanocytes. The cellular target was identified as the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (ATPase) by affinity chromatography. Oligomycin, a small molecule known to inhibit the mitochondrial ATPase, competed with PPA for its cellular target in melanocytes. In addition, PPA was shown to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria, consistent with inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase. Thus, PPA has been successfully used as a chemical probe in a forward chemical genetic approach to establish a link between the phenotype and the protein. The results attest to the power of screening small molecule libraries in zebrafish as a means of identifying mammalian targets and suggest the mitochondrial ATPase as a target for modulating pigmentation in both melanocytes and melanoma cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005.

TI  - ALDH2 mediates 5-nitrofuran activity in multiple species
AB  - Understanding how drugs work in vivo is critical for drug design and for maximizing the potential of currently available drugs. 5-nitrofurans are a class of prodrugs widely used to treat bacterial and trypanosome infections, but despite relative specificity, 5-nitrofurans often cause serious toxic side effects in people. Here, we use yeast and zebrafish, as well as human in vitro systems, to assess the biological activity of 5-nitrofurans, and we identify a conserved interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 and 5-nitrofurans across these species. In addition, we show that the activity of nifurtimox, a 5-nitrofuran anti-trypanosome prodrug, is dependent on zebrafish Aldh2 and is a substrate for human ALDH2. This study reveals a conserved and biologically relevant ALDH2-5-nitrofuran interaction that may have important implications for managing the toxicity of 5-nitrofuran treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

TI  - High-content screening in zebrafish embryos identifies butafenacil as a potent inducer of anemia
AB  - Using transgenic zebrafish (fli1:egfp) that stably express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) within vascular endothelial cells, we recently developed and optimized a 384-well high-content screening (HCS) assay that enables us to screen and identify chemicals affecting cardiovascular development and function at non-teratogenic concentrations. Within this assay, automated image acquisition procedures and custom image analysis protocols are used to quantify body length, heart rate, circulation, pericardial area, and intersegmental vessel area within individual live embryos exposed from 5 to 72 hours post-fertilization. After ranking developmental toxicity data generated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) zebrafish teratogenesis assay, we screened 26 of the most acutely toxic chemicals within EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library in concentration-response format (0.05-50 μM) using this HCS assay. Based on this screen, we identified butafenacil as a potent inducer of anemia, as exposure from 0.39 to 3.125 μM butafenacil completely abolished arterial circulation in the absence of effects on all other endpoints evaluated. Butafenacil is an herbicide that inhibits protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) - an enzyme necessary for heme production in vertebrates. Using o -dianisidine staining, we then revealed that severe butafenacil-induced anemia in zebrafish was due to a complete loss of hemoglobin following exposure during early development. Therefore, six additional PPO inhibitors within the ToxCast Phase-I library were screened to determine whether anemia represents a common adverse outcome for these herbicides. Embryonic exposure to only one of these PPO inhibitors - flumioxazin - resulted in a similar phenotype as butafenacil, albeit not as severe as butafenacil. Overall, this study highlights the potential utility of this assay for (1) screening chemicals for cardiovascular toxicity and (2) prioritizing chemicals for future hypothesis-driven and mechanism-focused investigations within zebrafish and mammalian models. © 2014 Leet et al.

Massive behavioral datasets are beginning to emerge, particularly from zebrafish labs, where behavioral assays can be performed rapidly and reproducibly in 96-well, high-throughput format. Mining these datasets and making comparisons across different assays are major challenges for the field. Here, we review behavioral barcoding, a process by which complex behavioral assays are reduced to a string of numeric features, facilitating analysis and comparison within and across datasets. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A forward chemical screen using zebrafish embryos with novel 2-substituted 2H-chromene derivatives
AB  - We synthesized 2-substituted 2H-chromene derivatives from salicylaldehyde using potassium vinylic borates in the presence of secondary amines. Our goal was to generate novel compounds that might modulate transforming growth factor-β signaling, based on limited rational design. Potassium vinyl trifluoroborates react with salicylaldehydes at 80 °C in the presence of a secondary amine and produce 2-substituted 2H-chromene derivatives with a 70-90% yield. A small library of these compounds, predicted to potentially interact with transforming growth factor-β receptors, was screened for bioactivity in living zebrafish embryos. We found that the related compounds differentially affect development, and demonstrate one compound that produces severe body axis alterations in early embryogenesis and at lower doses affects specifically cardiovascular development. This compound modulates specifically a Smad-independent transforming growth factor-β-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, namely p-SAPK/JNK. These compounds, as suggested by our biological assays, may prove useful to manipulate developmental programs and develop therapeutic tools. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.

TI  - Modular synthesis and preliminary biological evaluation of stereochemically diverse 1,3-dioxanes
AB  - Modular synthesis and substrate stereocontrol were combined to furnish 18,000 diverse 1,3-dioxanes whose distribution in chemical space rivals that of a reference set of over 2,000 bioactive small molecules. Library quality was assessed at key synthetic stages, culminating in a detailed postsynthesis analysis of purity, yield, and structural characterizability, and the resynthesis of library subsets that did not meet quality standards. The importance of this analysis-resynthesis process is highlighted by the discovery of new biological probes through organismal and protein binding assays, and by determination of the building block and stereochemical basis for their bioactivity. This evaluation of a portion of the 1,3-dioxane library suggests that many additional probes for chemical genetics will be identified as the entire library becomes biologically annotated.

TI  - Chemical and metabolomic screens identify novel biomarkers and antidotes for cyanide exposure
AB  - Exposure to cyanide causes a spectrum of cardiac, neurological, and metabolic dysfunctions that can be fatal. Improved cyanide antidotes are needed, but the ideal biological pathways to target are not known. To understand better the metabolic effects of cyanide and to discover novel cyanide antidotes, we developed a zebrafish model of cyanide exposure and scaled it for high-throughput chemical screening. In a screen of 3120 small molecules, we discovered 4 novel antidotes that block cyanide toxicity. The most potent antidote was riboflavin. Metabolomic profiling of cyanide-treated zebrafish revealed changes in bile acid and purine metabolism, most notably by an increase in inosine levels. Riboflavin normalizes many of the cyanide-induced neurological and metabolic perturbations in zebrafish. The metabolic effects of cyanide observed in zebrafish were conserved in a rabbit model of cyanide toxicity. Further, humans treated with nitroprusside, a drug that releases nitric oxide and cyanide ions, display increased circulating bile acids and inosine. In summary, riboflavin may be a novel treatment for cyanide toxicity and prophylactic measure during nitroprusside treatment, inosine may serve as a biomarker of cyanide exposure, and metabolites in the bile acid and purine metabolism pathways may shed light on the pathways critical to reversing cyanide toxicity.

TI  - A chemical genetic screen in zebrafish for pathways interacting with cdx4 in primitive hematopoiesis
AB  - cdx4, a caudal-related homeodomain-containing transcription factor, functions as a regulator of hox genes, thereby playing a critical role in anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning during embryogenesis. In zebrafish, homozygous deletion of the cdx4 gene results in a mutant phenotype known as kugelig, with aberrant A-P patterning and severe anemia characterized by decreased gata1 expression in the posterior lateral mesoderm. To identify pathways that interact with cdx4 during primitive hematopoiesis, we conducted a chemical genetic screen in the cdx4 mutant background for compounds that increase gata1 expression in cdx4 mutants. Among 2640 compounds that were tested, we discovered two compounds that rescued gata1 expression in the cdx4-mutant embryos. The strongest rescue was observed with bergapten, a psoralen compound found in bergamont oil. Another member of the psoralen family, 8-methoxypsoralen, was also found to rescue gata1 expression in cdx4-mutant embryos. The psoralen compounds also disrupted normal A-P patterning of embryos. These compounds modify the cdx4-mutant phenotype and will help elucidate signaling pathways that act downstream or parallel to the cdx4-hox pathway. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Image-based fluidic sorting system for automated Zebrafish egg sorting into multiwell plates
AB  - The global demand for the reduction of animal testing has led to the emergence of Zebrafish eggs/larvae as model organisms to replace current adult animal testing in, for example, toxicity testing. Because of the egg size (diameter 1.6 mm) and the relatively easy maintenance of Zebrafish farms the eggs also offer high-throughput screening (HTS). However, the current bottleneck for HTS is the cost-efficient placing of individual organisms into single wells of a multiwell plate (MWP). The system presented here is capable of storing, sorting, and placing individual organisms in a highly reproducible manner. In about 11 min a complete 96-MWP is filled, which corresponds to about 8 sec per egg. The survival rate of fertilized transgenic and wild-type eggs was comparable to the one of the control (control 6.7%, system 7.6%). Furthermore, it was also possible to place dechorionated eggs into individual wells. The results demonstrate that the cost efficient system works gentle and reliable enough to disburden scientists from the exhausting and monotonous job of placing single eggs into single wells, such that they can concentrate on the scientific aspects of their experiments and create results with a higher statistical relevance. © 2011 by the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

TI  - In vivo angiogenesis screening and mechanism of action of novel tanshinone derivatives produced by one-pot combinatorial modification of natural tanshinone mixture from Salvia miltiorrhiza
AB  - Background: Natural products present in low quantity in herb medicines constitute an important source of chemical diversity. However, the isolation of sufficient amounts of these low abundant constituents for structural modification has been a challenge for several decades and subsequently halts research on the utilization of this important source of chemical entities for drug discovery and development. And, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiocerebral vascular diseases and wound healing recently. The present study investigates the pro-angiogenic potential of tanshinone derivatives produced by one-pot synthesis using zebrafish model. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to address the difficulty of chemical modification of low abundant constituents in herb medicines, a novel one-pot combinatorial modification was used to diversify a partially purified tanshinone mixture from Salvia miltiorrhiza. This led to the isolation of ten new imidazole-tanshinones (Compounds 1-10) and one oxazoletanshinone (Compound 11), the structures of which were characterized by spectroscopic methods in combination with single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. The angiogenesis activities of the new tanshinone derivatives were determined in an experimental model of chemical-induced blood vessels damage in zebrafish. Of all the tested new derivatives, compound 10 exhibited the most potent vascular protective and restorative activity with an EC50 value of 0.026 μM. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the pro-angiogenesis effect of 10 probably involved the VEGF/FGF-Src-MAPK and PI3K-P38 signalling pathways by gene expression analysis and a blocking assay with pathways-specific kinase inhibitors. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, our study demonstrated the more distinctive pro-angiogenic properties of 10 than other tanshinones and revealed 10 has potential for development as a pro-angiogenic agent for diseases associated with insufficient angiogenesis. Our results highlighted the great potential of adopting a newly modified one-pot approach to enhance the chemical diversity and biological activities of constituents from natural products regardless of their abundances. © 2014 Zhang et al.

TI  - A high-content screening assay in transgenic zebrafish identifies two novel activators of fgf signaling
AB  - Zebrafish have become an invaluable vertebrate animal model to interrogate small molecule libraries for modulators of complex biological pathways and phenotypes. We have recently described the implementation of a quantitative, high-content imaging assay in multi-well plates to analyze the effects of small molecules on Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling in vivo. Here we have evaluated the capability of the assay to identify compounds that hyperactivate FGF signaling from a test cassette of agents with known biological activities. Using a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for FGF activity, we screened 1040 compounds from an annotated library of known bioactive agents, including FDA-approved drugs. The assay identified two molecules, 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate and pyrithione zinc, that enhanced FGF signaling in specific areas of the brain. Subsequent studies revealed that both compounds specifically expanded FGF target gene expression. Furthermore, treatment of early stage embryos with either compound resulted in dorsalized phenotypes characteristic of hyperactivation of FGF signaling in early development. Documented activities for both agents included activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), consistent with FGF hyperactivation. To conclude, we demonstrate the power of automated quantitative high-content imaging to identify small molecule modulators of FGF. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - A phenotypic screen in zebrafish identifies a novel small-molecule inducer of ectopic tail formation suggestive of alterations in non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling
AB  - Zebrafish have recently emerged as an attractive model for the in vivo bioassay-guided isolation and characterization of pharmacologically active small molecules of natural origin. We carried out a zebrafish-based phenotypic screen of over 3000 plant-derived secondary metabolite extracts with the goal of identifying novel small-molecule modulators of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways. One of the bioactive plant extracts identified in this screen - Jasminum gilgianum, an Oleaceae species native to Papua New Guinea - induced ectopic tails during zebrafish embryonic development. As ectopic tail formation occurs when BMP or non-canonical Wnt signaling is inhibited during the tail protrusion process, we suspected a constituent of this extract to act as a modulator of these pathways. A bioassay-guided isolation was carried out on the basis of this zebrafish phenotype, identifying para-coumaric acid methyl ester (pCAME) as the active compound. We then performed an in-depth phenotypic analysis of pCAME-treated zebrafish embryos, including a tissue-specific marker analysis of the secondary tails. We found pCAME to synergize with the BMP-inhibitors dorsomorphin and LDN-193189 in inducing ectopic tails, and causing convergence-extension defects in compound-treated embryos. These results indicate that pCAME may interfere with non-canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of Jnk, a downstream target of Wnt/PCP signaling (via morpholino antisense knockdown and pharmacological inhibition with the kinase inhibitor SP600125) phenocopied pCAME-treated embryos. However, immunoblotting experiments revealed pCAME to not directly inhibit Jnk-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun, suggesting additional targets of SP600125, and/or other pathways, as possibly being involved in the ectopic tail formation activity of pCAME. Further investigation of pCAME's mechanism of action will help determine this compound's pharmacological utility. © 2013 Gebruers et al.

TI  - Juxtaposition of chemical and mutation-induced developmental defects in zebrafish reveal a copper-chelating activity for kalihinol F
AB  - A major hurdle in using complex systems for drug screening is the difficulty of defining the mechanistic targets of small molecules. The zebrafish provides an excellent model system for juxtaposing developmental phenotypes with mechanism discovery using organism genetics. We carried out a phenotype-based screen of uncharacterized small molecules in zebrafish that produced a variety of chemically induced phenotypes with potential genetic parallels. Specifically, kalihinol F caused an undulated notochord, defects in pigment formation, hematopoiesis, and neural development. These phenotypes were strikingly similar to the zebrafish mutant, calamity, an established model of copper deficiency. Further studies into the mechanism of action of kalihinol F revealed a copper-chelating activity. Our data support this mechanism of action for kalihinol F and the utility of zebrafish as an effective system for identifying therapeutic and target pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A forward chemical screen in zebrafish identifies a retinoic acid derivative with receptor specificity
AB  - Background: Retinoids regulate key developmental pathways throughout life, and have potential uses for differentiation therapy. It should be possible to identify novel retinoids by coupling new chemical reactions with screens using the zebrafish embryonic model. Principal Findings: We synthesized novel retinoid analogues and derivatives by amide coupling, obtaining 80-92% yields. A small library of these compounds was screened for bioactivity in living zebrafish embryos. We found that several structurally related compounds significantly affect development. Distinct phenotypes are generated depending on time of exposure, and we characterize one compound (BT10) that produces specific cardiovascular defects when added 1 day post fertilization. When compared to retinoic acid (ATRA), BT10 shows similar but not identical changes in the expression pattern of embryonic genes that are known targets of the retinoid pathway. Reporter assays determined that BT10 interacts with all three RAR receptor sub-types, but has no activity for RXR receptors, at all concentrations tested. Conclusions: Our screen has identified a novel retinoid with specificity for retinoid receptors. This lead compound may be useful for manipulating components of retinoid signaling networks, and may be further derivatized for enhanced activity. © 2010 Das et al.

TI  - Environmentally induced oxidative stress in aquatic animals
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an unenviable part of aerobic life. Their steady-state concentration is a balance between production and elimination providing certain steady-state ROS level. The dynamic equilibrium can be disturbed leading to enhanced ROS level and damage to cellular constituents which is called " oxidative stress" This review describes the general processes responsible for ROS generation in aquatic animals and critically analyses used markers for identification of oxidative stress. Changes in temperature, oxygen levels and salinity can cause the stress in natural and artificial conditions via induction of disbalance between ROS production and elimination. Human borne pollutants can also enhance ROS level in hydrobionts. The role of transition metal ions, such as copper, chromium, mercury and arsenic, and pesticides, namely insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides along with oil products in induction of oxidative stress is highlighted. Last years the research in biology of free radicals was refocused from only descriptive works to molecular mechanisms with particular interest to ones enhancing tolerance. The function of some transcription regulators (Keap1-Nrf2 and HIF-1α) in coordination of organisms' response to oxidative stress is discussed. The future directions in the field are related with more accurate description of oxidative stress, the identification of its general characteristics and mechanisms responsible for adaptation to the stress have been also discussed. The last part marks some perspectives in the study of oxidative stress in hydrobionts, which, in addition to classic use, became more and more popular to address general biological questions such as development, aging and pathologies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology of hazardous heavy metals: Environmental persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation
AB  - Heavy metals are well-known environmental pollutants due to their toxicity, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulative nature. Their natural sources include weathering of metal-bearing rocks and volcanic eruptions, while anthropogenic sources include mining and various industrial and agricultural activities. Mining and industrial processing for extraction of mineral resources and their subsequent applications for industrial, agricultural, and economic development has led to an increase in the mobilization of these elements in the environment and disturbance of their biogeochemical cycles. Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with toxic heavy metals is an environmental problem of public health concern. Being persistent pollutants, heavy metals accumulate in the environment and consequently contaminate the food chains. Accumulation of potentially toxic heavy metals in biota causes a potential health threat to their consumers including humans. This article comprehensively reviews the different aspects of heavy metals as hazardous materials with special focus on their environmental persistence, toxicity for living organisms, and bioaccumulative potential. The bioaccumulation of these elements and its implications for human health are discussed with a special coverage on fish, rice, and tobacco. The article will serve as a valuable educational resource for both undergraduate and graduate students and for researchers in environmental sciences. Environmentally relevant most hazardous heavy metals and metalloids include Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As. The trophic transfer of these elements in aquatic and terrestrial food chains/webs has important implications for wildlife and human health. It is very important to assess and monitor the concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals and metalloids in different environmental segments and in the resident biota. A comprehensive study of the environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology of hazardous heavy metals and metalloids shows that steps should be taken to minimize the impact of these elements on human health and the environment. © 2019 Hazrat Ali et al.

TI  - Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in fish as a biomarker of chemical exposure
AB  - This review compiles and evaluates existing scientific information on the use, limitations, and procedural considerations for EROD activity (a catalytic measurement of cytochrome P4501A induction) as a biomarker in fish. A multitude of chemicals induce EROD activity in a variety of fish species, the most potent inducers being structural analogs of 2,3,7,8-tetracholordibenzo-p-dioxin. Although certain chemicals may inhibit EROD induction/activity, this interference is generally not a drawback to the use of EROD induction as a biomarker. The various methods of EROD analysis currently in use yield comparable results, particularly when data are expressed as relative rates of EROD activity. EROD induction in fish is well characterized, the most important modifying factors being fish species, reproductive status and age, all of which can be controlled through proper study design. Good candidate species for biomonitoring should have a wide range between basal and induced EROD activity (e.g., common carp, channel catfish, and mummichog). EROD activity has proven value as a biomarker in a number of field investigations of bleached kraft mill and industrial effluents, contaminated sediments, and chemical spills. Research on mechanisms of CYP1A-induced toxicity suggests that EROD activity may not only indicate chemical exposure, but also may also precede effects at various levels of biological organization. A current research need is the development of chemical exposure-response relationships for EROD activity in fish. In addition, routine reporting in the literature of EROD activity in standard positive and negative control material will enhance confidence in comparing results from different studies using this biomarker.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase, an old biomarker with a new future? Field trials in association with two urban rivers and a paper mill in Newfoundland
AB  - Biological markers are sensitive, cost effective tools for identifying risks of environmental contamination. The cytochrome P450-linked mixed-function oxygenase (MFO) system has been extensively validated in the environment, not only in association with point sources of pollution, but also in association with contamination over broad geographical areas. However, there is a recognized need for the establishment of biomarkers for assessing a variety of toxicological endpoints. With respect to neuromuscular functions, a recent study in the North Sea has indicated that the 'old' biomarker, acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), which is sensitive to selected organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, may be responding to low levels of contaminants in the environment, putatively by compounds other than, or in addition to, pesticides. We now provide evidence for such a possibility. A distinct depression of ACHE was found in muscle tissues of trout (Salmo trutta) taken from two urban rivers in St. John's (Virginia River and Rennie's Mill River), in comparison with a nearby reference river (South Brook). Most striking was the fact that depression was observed in the 50% range. A similar high level of enzyme depression was observed in muscle tissues of flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) taken in the area of a pulp and paper mill (Birchy Bay in the Bay of Islands), in comparison with a nearby reference site. Depression of ACHE was associated with induction of MFO enzyme activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) in liver tissues of both trout and flounder. We provide evidence and discussion that contaminants other than pesticides, including compounds in complex mixtures of combustion hydrocarbons and natural wood leachate, could be responsible for the depressed ACHE levels observed in our studies (as well as those in the North Sea) and suggest that this old biomarker may have a new future in biological monitoring and assessment programmes.

TI  - The Comet assay for the evaluation of genotoxic impact in aquatic environments
AB  - This review considers the potential of the Comet assay (or Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis, SCGE) to evaluate the environmental impact of genotoxins in aquatic environments. It focuses on in vivo and in situ studies that have been carried out in various marine and freshwater sentinel species, published in the last 5 years. A large number of the studies reviewed report that the Comet assay is more sensitive when compared with other biomarkers commonly used in genetic ecotoxicology, such as sister chromatid exchanges or micronucleus test. Due to its high sensitivity, the Comet assay is widely influenced by laboratory procedures suggesting that standard protocols are required for both fish and mussel cells. However, there are still a wide variety of personalised Comet procedures evident in the literature reviewed, making comparison between published results often very difficult. Standardization and inter-laboratory calibration of the Comet assay as applied to aquatic species will be required if the Comet assay is to be used routinely by national bodies charged with monitoring water quality. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Towards an alternative for the acute fish LC50 test in chemical assessment: The fish embryo toxicity test goes multi-species - An update
AB  - After its standardisation at the national level in Germany (DIN 38415-6, 2001; DIN, 2001), the 48 h sewage testing assay with zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos has been submitted for standardisation to ISO. As an alternative to the conventional acute (96 h) fish test, a modified fish embryo test will be submitted to the OECD for chemical testing in late 2005. For this, a protocol originally designed for zebrafish was adapted to fit also the requirements of other OECD species, namely medaka (Oryzias latipes) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Results document that the transfer of the protocol is possible with only minor modifications. Data obtained from embryo tests with the three species are comparable. Statistical analysis of existing zebrafish embryo toxicity data resulted in the conclusions (1) that there is a reliable correlation between the fish embryo test and the acute fish test, (2) that the confidence belt of the regression line was relatively small, but that the prediction range was relatively wide. The regression thus seems appropriate to describe the relationship between acute fish and embryo LC50 with good confidence, but is less appropriate as a prediction model. Investigations into oxygen requirements of zebrafish embryos reveal that they adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels and survive at concentrations of 2 mg/l without malformations. Zebrafish embryos can thus be exposed in very small toxicant volumes (100 μl), which is of particular interest for the testing of metabolites. Dechorionation studies with 48 h old zebrafish embryos indicate that the barrier function of the chorion increases with the lipophilicity of the test compound. Finally, examples are given as to how additional endpoints can be incorporated into the fish embryo test protocol to extend its scope, e.g. to sediment toxicity assessment or genotoxicity and mutagenicity testing.

TI  - Chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX): A novel in vitro bioassay for Ah receptor active compounds in sediments and pore water
AB  - This study demonstrates that the novel in vitro CALUX (chemicaI-activated luciferase expression) assay is a rapid, sensitive assay for assessing the toxic potency of (mixtures of) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-active compounds in sediments and pore waters. A rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cell line, stably transfected with a construct containing the dioxin-responsive element (DRE) sequence and the luciferase reporter gene, was used to determine the relative potency or the total activities of AhR-active compounds in sediment and pore water extracts. This novel CALUX assay had a detection limit of 0.5 fmol of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The sensitivity and linear working range was slightly better than for the ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) assay in H4IIE wild type cells. The primary improvement of the CALUX assay compared to the EROD assay, however, is that the CALUX assay is insensitive to substrate inhibition. The CALUX activity induced by organic extracts from 450-mg aliquots of sediment or 250-μl aliquots of pore water corresponded with the instrumentally analyzed degree of pollution of the sediment. Using pore water, only a simple and rapid extraction procedure was needed, without additional clean-up to prevent cell death. The response from pore water samples in an 8-day early life stage test with zebra fish (Branchydanio rerio) corresponded with the CALUX induction, although the correlation was sometimes disturbed by heavy metals. Two polychlorinated terphenyl mixtures, the PCB-substitute Ugilec 141, polybrominated diphenylethers, and the PCB-mixture Clophen A50 were tested in the CALUX assay and had induction potencies that were 10-4-10-7 compared to TCDD.

TI  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ecotoxicology in marine ecosystems
AB  - Low levels of oil and hence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are naturally present in the marine environment, although levels have increased significantly following human extraction and use of oil and gas. Other major anthropogenic sources of PAHs include smelters, the use of fossil fuels in general, and various methods of waste disposal, especially incineration. There are two major sources for PAHs to marine ecosystems in Norway: the inshore smelter industry, and offshore oil and gas production activities. A distinction is generally made between petrogenic (oil-derived) and pyrogenic (combustion-derived) PAHs. Although petrogenic PAHs appear to be bioavailable to a large extent, pyrogenic PAHs are often associated with soot particles and less available for uptake into organisms. There is extensive evidence linking sediment-associated PAHs to induction of phase-I enzymes, development of DNA adducts, and eventually neoplastic lesions in fish. Most studies have focused on high-molecular-weight, carcinogenic PAHs such as benzo[a]pyrene. It is less clear how two- and three-ring PAHs affect fish, and there is even experimental evidence to indicate that these chemicals may inhibit some components of the phase I system rather than produce induction. There is a need for increased research efforts to clarify biological effects of two- and three-ring PAHs, PAH mixtures, and adaptation processes in marine ecosystems. Copyright© Taylor & Francis Inc.

TI  - The impact of ZnO nanoparticle aggregates on the embryonic development of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - With extensive use of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in a variety of applications comes a higher potential of release into aquatic environments. NPs tend to form much larger aggregates in water, which are expected to settle down to the bottom of the water column and possibly get mixed with the sediments. However, little is known about the environmental impacts and biological effects of these aggregated NPs in the sediment column. In this study, we examined the sedimentation of nanoscale ZnO particles (nZnO) in zebrafish culture medium, and assessed the toxicity of settled nZnO aggregates on developing zebrafish embryos and larvae. Given the known dissolution of nZnO particles to release Zn2+, we also assessed the toxic effect of soluble Zn2+ in this organism. We demonstrated that within 48 h, micron-sized nZnO aggregates were formed and settled out of the culture medium. These aggregates were found to exert dose-dependent toxicity to zebrafish embryos and larvae, reducing the hatching rate and causing pericardial edema. The observed toxicity of the nZnO aggregates was not likely a result solely of particle dissolution, as soluble Zn2+ alone caused much less toxicity to zebrafish embryos than nZnO. Instead, the combination of both nZnO and Zn2+ may contribute to the embryonic toxicity, possibly by increasing reactive oxidative species (ROS) and/or compromising the cellular oxidative stress response. Interestingly, we demonstrated that one type of formulated sediments could mitigate the toxicity of nZnO aggregates, highlighting a possible countermeasure to reduce the adverse impact of nZnO aggregates on the environment. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - A new sediment contact assay to assess particle-bound pollutants using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Based on a bioassay battery covering only primary producers and consumers as well as degraders, the potential ecological hazard of sediments to vertebrates cannot be estimated comprehensively. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and standardize integrated vertebrate-based test systems for sediment investigation strategies. Whereas vertebrate-based in vitro systems have frequently been used for the investigation of aqueous samples, there is a significant lack of whole sediment assays. Thus, the purpose of the present study was: (1) to develop a rapid and reliable, but comprehensive method to investigate native sediments and particulate matters without preceding extraction procedures; (2) to compare the hazard potential of solid phase sediments to the effects of corresponding pore waters and organic extracts in order to characterize the bioavailability of the particle-bound pollutants; and (3) to relatively evaluate the embryotoxic effects of sediments from the catchment areas of the rivers Rhine, Neckar and Danube. Methods (or Main Features). To investigate the toxicity of sediment samples on vertebrates, the standard embryo toxicity test with the zebrafish (Danio rerio; Hamilton-Buchanan 1922) according to DIN 38415-6 was modified with respect to exposure scheme and toxicological endpoints. Sediments from the catchment area of the Neckar River were assessed using pore waters, acetonic extracts and native sediments in order to get inside into the potential bioavailability of particle-bound pollutants. A comprehensive test protocol for the investigation of native sediments in the embryo toxicity test with the zebrafish is presented. Results and Discussion. The fish embryo assay with Danio rerio can be carried out with both aqueous and organic sediment extracts as well as native (whole, solid phase) sediment samples. Elongation of exposure time from 48 to up to 196 h significantly increased the mortality. Using the fish egg assay with native sediments, a broad range of embryotoxic effects could be elucidated, including clear-cut dose-response curves for the embryotoxic effects of contaminated sediments; in contrast, absence of embryotoxic effects could be demonstrated even for the highest test concentrations of unpolluted sediments. With native sediments, embryotoxicity was clearly higher than with corresponding pore waters, thus corroborating the view that - at least for fish eggs - the bioavailability of particle-bound lipophilic substances in native sediments is higher than generally assumed. The relative ranking of sediment toxicity was identical using both native sediments and sediment extracts, EC20 values of the latter, however, being eight time lower higher than with the native sediments. A comparison of the embryo toxic effects of samples from the Neckar area with locations along the Rhine and Danube rivers elucidated a broad range of results, thus indicating different levels of contamination. Conclusions. A modified protocol of the zebrafish embryo test allows the assessment of sediment toxicity in both aqueous extracts and native sediments. The isolated investigation of pore waters may result in a clear-cut underestimation of the bioavailability of lipophilic particle-bound substances (as determined by native sediments). Recommendations and Perspectives. The zebrafish embryo test with native (whole, solid phase) sediments appears very promising for the evaluation of the bioavailable fraction of lipophilic particle-bound substances and can therefore be recommended for the evaluation of vertebrate toxicity in tiered sediment test strategies and dredging directives such as the HABAB-WSV. Whereas acetone extracts may be tested as a rough estimation of embryotoxicity, native sediment samples will provide a more comprehensive and realistic insight into the bioavailable hazard potential.

TI  - Contaminant-induced oxidative stress in fish: a mechanistic approach
AB  - The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living organisms was described more than 60 years ago and virtually immediately it was suggested that ROS were involved in various pathological processes and aging. The state when ROS generation exceeds elimination leading to an increased steady-state ROS level has been called “oxidative stress.” Although ROS association with many pathological states in animals is well established, the question of ROS responsibility for the development of these states is still open. Fish represent the largest group of vertebrates and they inhabit a broad range of ecosystems where they are subjected to many different aquatic contaminants. In many cases, the deleterious effects of contaminants have been connected to induction of oxidative stress. Therefore, deciphering of molecular mechanisms leading to such contaminant effects and organisms’ response may let prevent or minimize deleterious impacts of oxidative stress. This review describes general aspects of ROS homeostasis, in particular highlighting its basic aspects, modification of cellular constituents, operation of defense systems and ROS-based signaling with an emphasis on fish systems. A brief introduction to oxidative stress theory is accompanied by the description of a recently developed classification system for oxidative stress based on its intensity and time course. Specific information on contaminant-induced oxidative stress in fish is covered in sections devoted to such pollutants as metal ions (particularly iron, copper, chromium, mercury, arsenic, nickel, etc.), pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) and oil with accompanying pollutants. In the last section, certain problems and perspectives in studies of oxidative stress in fish are described. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - An ecotoxicological view on neurotoxicity assessment
AB  - The numbers of potential neurotoxicants in the environment are raising and pose a great risk for humans and the environment. Currently neurotoxicity assessment is mostly performed to predict and prevent harm to human populations. Despite all the efforts invested in the last years in developing novel in vitro or in silico test systems, in vivo tests with rodents are still the only accepted test for neurotoxicity risk assessment in Europe. Despite an increasing number of reports of species showing altered behaviour, neurotoxicity assessment for species in the environment is not required and therefore mostly not performed. Considering the increasing numbers of environmental contaminants with potential neurotoxic potential, eco-neurotoxicity should be also considered in risk assessment. In order to do so novel test systems are needed that can cope with species differences within ecosystems. In the field, online-biomonitoring systems using behavioural information could be used to detect neurotoxic effects and effect-directed analyses could be applied to identify the neurotoxicants causing the effect. Additionally, toxic pressure calculations in combination with mixture modelling could use environmental chemical monitoring data to predict adverse effects and prioritize pollutants for laboratory testing. Cheminformatics based on computational toxicological data from in vitro and in vivo studies could help to identify potential neurotoxicants. An array of in vitro assays covering different modes of action could be applied to screen compounds for neurotoxicity. The selection of in vitro assays could be guided by AOPs relevant for eco-neurotoxicity. In order to be able to perform risk assessment for eco-neurotoxicity, methods need to focus on the most sensitive species in an ecosystem. A test battery using species from different trophic levels might be the best approach. To implement eco-neurotoxicity assessment into European risk assessment, cheminformatics and in vitro screening tests could be used as first approach to identify eco-neurotoxic pollutants. In a second step, a small species test battery could be applied to assess the risks of ecosystems. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Zebrafish models for assessing developmental and reproductive toxicity
AB  - The zebrafish is increasingly used as a vertebrate animal model for in vivo drug discovery and for assessing chemical toxicity and safety. Numerous studies have confirmed that zebrafish and mammals are similar in their physiology, development, metabolism and pathways, and that zebrafish responses to toxic substances are highly predictive of mammalian responses. Developmental and reproductive toxicity assessments are an important part of new drug safety profiling. A significant number of drug candidates have failed in preclinical tests due to their adverse effect on development and reproductivity. Compared to conventional mammal testing, zebrafish testing for assessing developmental and reproductive toxicity offers several compelling experimental advantages, including transparency of embryo and larva, higher throughput, shorter test period, lower cost, smaller amount of compound required, easier manipulation and direct compound delivery. Toxicity and safety assessments using zebrafish have also been accepted by the FDA and EMEA for investigative new drug (IND) approval. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Nanoplastics decrease the toxicity of a complex PAH mixture but impair mitochondrial energy production in developing Zebrafish
AB  - Plastics are recognized as a worldwide threat to the environment, possibly affecting human health and wildlife. Small forms of plastics such as micro- and nanoplastics can interact with other organic contaminants, potentially acting as chemical carriers and modulating their toxicity. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of polystyrene nanoparticles (Nano-PS) and a real-world environmental PAH mixture (Elizabeth River Sediment Extract, ERSE, comprised of 36 detected PAHs) to zebrafish embryos and larvae. Embryos were exposed to Nano-PS (0.1-10 ppm) or ERSE (0.1-5% v/v, equivalent to ςPAH 5.07-25.36 ppb) or coexposed to a combination of both. Larvae exposed to Nano-PS did not exhibit developmental defects, while larvae exposed to ERSE (2-5%) showed classic signs of PAH toxicity such as heart malformation and deformities in the jaw, fin, and tail. ERSE (5%) also impaired vascular development in the brain. When coexposed, Nano-PS decreased the developmental deformities and impaired vascular development caused by ERSE. This was strongly correlated to the lower PAH bioaccumulation detected in the coexposed animals (whole larvae, as well as the yolk sac, brain, and heart). Our data suggest that PAHs are sorbing to the surface of the Nano-PS, decreasing the concentration, uptake, and toxicity of free PAHs during the exposure. Such sorption of PAHs increases the agglomeration rate of Nano-PS during the exposure time, potentially decreasing the uptake of Nano-PS and associated PAHs. Despite that, similar induction of EROD activity was detected in animals exposed to ERSE in the presence or not of Nano-PS, suggesting that enough PAHs were accumulated in the organisms to induce cellular defense mechanisms. Nano-PS exposure (single or combined with ERSE) decreased the mitochondrial coupling efficiency and increased NADH production, suggesting an impairment on ATP production accompanied by a compensatory mechanism. Our data indicate that nanoplastics can sorb contaminants and potentially decrease their uptake due to particle agglomeration. Nanoplastics also target and disrupt mitochondrial energy production and act as vectors for the mitochondrial uptake of sorbed contaminants during embryonic and larval stages. Such negative effects of nanoplastics on energy metabolism and efficiency could be detrimental under multiple-stressors exposures and energy-demanding scenarios, which remains to be validated. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Sediment-water interactions of natural oestrogens under estuarine conditions
AB  - The natural human female hormones oestrone and 17β-oestradiol have been implicated in the disruption of endocrine systems in some wildlife adjacent to sewage effluents. The sorption behaviour of these two compounds under estuarine conditions was studied by spiking either 2.55 μg of oestrone or 2.65 μg of 17β-oestradiol in kinetic experiments. In equilibrium experiments, 3 ng of oestrone or 3.2 ng of 17β-oestradiol was added in each of the centrifuge tubes. Sorption onto sediment particles was relatively slow, with sorption equilibrium being reached in about 70 and 170 h for oestrone and 17β-oestradiol, respectively. The effects of a variety of environmental parameters on sorption were studied including salinity, sediment concentration (SC), the presence of a third phase, particle size and, also, surfactant concentrations. Results show that although salinity did not induce any statistically significant effect on the sorption of 17β-oestradiol, it did statistically enhance the sorption of oestrone, and a salting constant of 0.3 1 mol-1 was derived. The partition coefficient for both compounds decreased with increasing sediment concentration, a phenomenon that has been widely reported and attributed to the presence of colloids (which could enhance dissolved concentrations). In this paper, the true partition coefficients for sediment particles (Kptrue) and colloidal particles (Kctrue) have been calculated, and a Kptrue value of 141 and 102 ml g-1 was obtained for oestrone and 17β-oestradiol, respectively. In addition, Kctruevalues for oestrone (222 × 102 ml g-1) and 17β-oestradiol (135 × 102 ml g-1) were two orders of magnitude higher than their respective Kptrue values, suggesting that the colloidal particles are significantly stronger sorbents for natural oestrogens than sediment particles. Particles of different sizes were found to have different partition coefficients due to the strong relationships between partition coefficients for the two compounds and particulate organic carbon (POC) contents and specific surface areas (SSAs). The presence of a surfactant was shown to reduce the partition coefficients for the two compounds, although its concentrations being used were higher than those normally found in the natural environment. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Cellular and molecular biology of aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor-mediated gene expression.
AB  - 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds elicit diverse toxic and biochemical responses in laboratory animals and mammalian cells in culture. TCDD induces CYP1A1 gene expression and results of extensive research have delineated the molecular mechanism of this response. In target cells, TCDD initially binds to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor which accumulates in the nucleus as an Ah-receptor:aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein heterodimeric complex. The nuclear Ah receptor complex acts as a ligand-induced transcription factor which binds to transacting genomic dioxin/xenobiotic responsive elements (DREs/XREs) located in the 5'-regulatory region upstream from the initiation start site and this interaction results in transactivation of gene transcription. DREs have been identified in several other genes which are induced by TCDD, including CYP1A2, aldehyde-3-dehydrogenase, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase, and glutathione S transferase Ya and similar induction response pathways have been observed or proposed. However, TCDD and other Ah receptor agonists also inhibit expression of several genes and research in this laboratory has investigated inhibition of estrogen (E2)-induced genes including uterine epidermal growth factor, c-fos protooncogene, and the progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor (ER) and cathepsin D genes in human breast cancer cell lines. In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, E2 induces cathepsin D gene expression and this is associated with formation of an ER/Sp1 complex at the sequence in the promoter region (-199/-165) of this gene. Within 30 min TCDD causes a rapid inhibition of E2-induced cathepsin D gene expression in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides which include the wild-type ER/Sp1 and various mutants, it was shown by gel electromobility shift and transient transfection assays that the nuclear Ah receptor complex binds to an imperfect DRE located between the ER and Sp1 binding sequences. This interaction results in disruption of the ER/Sp1 complex and inhibition of E2-induced gene expression. These results illustrate that the nuclear Ah receptor complex also exhibits activity as a negative transcription factor via a mechanism which is similar to that reported for Ah receptor-mediated induction of gene expression.

TI  - A novel contact assay for testing genotoxicity of chemicals and whole sediments in zebrafish embryos
AB  - Broad consensus exists that whole-sediment exposure protocols represent the most realistic scenario to simulate in situ exposure conditions. So far, however, several endpoints including genotoxicity in vertebrate-based systems could be tested only after transfer of particle-bound substances into the aqueous phase. The present study was carried out to develop a protocol for generating a suspension of single cells from sediment-exposed zebrafish embryos that is suitable for detecting particle-bound genotoxicity in the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). In this solid-phase genotoxicity assay, a whole-body cell suspension derived from zebrafish embryos exposed to native (whole) sediments is assayed in the comet assay. Several chemical and mechanical isolation procedures were compared to optimize cell yield and minimize DNA damage by the method itself. If compared to collagenase isolation, mechanical cell dissociation gave less DNA damage; trypsinization resulted in similarly low DNA damage but significantly lower cell yield. In order to test the optimized protocol, effects of well-known genotoxicants (4-nitroquinoline-N- oxide, nitrofurantoin, hydrogen peroxide, benzo[a]pyrene) and of two sediments from the upper Rhine River (Germany) on zebrafish embryos were investigated. Results documented clear-cut genotoxicity for all four substances and for one of the two whole-sediment samples. An ultraviolet (UV) light exposure of whole embryos and primary cultures from embryos elucidated only minor effects for the whole embryos compared to the primary cells. Consequently, UV irradiation cannot be suggested as a positive control in intact zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, the newly developed sediment contact assay can be recommended for the detection of both single substances but also the bioavailable fraction of the total hazard potential of sediments. © 2006 SETAC.

TI  - Sediment-water interactions of pharmaceutical residues in the river environment
AB  - To assess the environmental fate and risks of pharmaceuticals, the determination of their distributions between sediment and water is crucial as a controlling process. In this paper, the concentrations of 9 selected pharmaceuticals were determined in water and sediment samples from the River Medway, Kent, UK between December 2009 and December 2010. In the water phase, there was a spatial variation of concentration with the highest concentrations being detected in the sewage outfall, indicating it being an important point source in the river. In terms of seasonal variations, the highest concentrations (13-878ngL-1) were detected in June 2010. In the surface sediment phase, the highest concentrations (5.3-33.6ngg-1 dry weight) were observed at the sewage outfall, although in February 2010 the highest concentrations were detected downstream of the sewage outfall indicating a delayed response in sediment accumulation of pharmaceuticals in relation to the water phase. The partition coefficient of pharmaceuticals between surface sediment and water was variable, reflecting a dynamic process of sediment-water interaction and the varying nature of sediments. Overall the partition coefficient was shown to decrease with an increase in suspended sediment concentration. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficient of the pharmaceuticals was shown to be positively related to their molecular weight (MW), suggesting that sediment-water interactions were partly a partition process favoring large molecules. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Comet Assay and its applications in the field of ecotoxicology: A mature tool that continues to expand its perspectives
AB  - Since Singh and colleagues, in 1988, launched to the scientific community the alkaline Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) protocol, or Comet Assay, its uses and applications has been increasing. The thematic areas of its current employment in the evaluation of genetic toxicity are vast, either in vitro or in vivo, both in the laboratory and in the environment, terrestrial or aquatic. It has been applied to a wide range of experimental models: bacteria, fungi, cells culture, arthropods, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and humans. This document is intended to be a comprehensive review of what has been published to date on the field of ecotoxicology, aiming at the following main aspects: (i) to show the most relevant experimental models used as bioindicators both in the laboratory and in the field. Fishes are clearly the most adopted group, reflecting their popularity as bioindicator models, as well as a primary concern over the aquatic environment health. Amphibians are among the most sensitive organisms to environmental changes, mainly due to an early aquatic-dependent development stage and a highly permeable skin. Moreover, in the terrestrial approach, earthworms, plants or mammalians are excellent organisms to be used as experimental models for genotoxic evaluation of pollutants, complex mix of pollutants and chemicals, in both laboratory and natural environment. (ii) To review the development and modifications of the protocols used and the cell types (or tissues) used. The most recent developments concern the adoption of the enzyme linked assay (digestion with lesion-specific repair endonucleases) and prediction of the ability to repair of oxidative DNA damage, which is becoming a widespread approach, albeit challenging. For practical/technical reasons, blood is the most common choice but tissues/cells like gills, sperm cells, early larval stages, coelomocytes, liver or kidney have been also used. (iii) To highlight correlations with other biomarkers. (iv) To build a constructive criticism and summarize the needs for protocol improvements for future test applications within the field of ecotoxicology. The Comet Assay is still developing and its potential is yet underexploited in experimental models, mesocosmos or natural ecosystems. © 2015 de Lapuente, Lourenço, Mendo, Borràs, Martins, Costa and Pacheco.

TI  - Field-scale reduction of PCB bioavailability with activated carbon amendment to river sediments
AB  - Remediation of contaminated sediments remains a technological challenge because traditional approaches do not always achieve risk reduction goals for human health and ecosystem protection and can even be destructive for natural resources. Recent work has shown that uptake of persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the food web is strongly influenced by the nature of contaminant binding, especially to black carbon surfaces in sediments. We demonstrate for the first time in a contaminated river that application of activated carbon to sediments in the field reduces biouptake of PCBs in benthic organisms. After treatment with activated carbon applied at a dose similar to the native organic carbon of sediment, bioaccumulation in freshwater oligochaete worms was reduced compared to preamendment conditions by 69 to 99%, and concentrations of PCBs in water at equilibrium with the sediment were reduced by greater than 93% at all treatment sites for up to three years of monitoring. By comparing measured reductions in bioaccumulation of tetra- and penta-chlorinated PCB congeners resulting from field application of activated carbon to a laboratory study where PCBs were preloaded onto activated carbon, it is evident that equilibrium sorption had not been achieved in the field. Although other remedies may be appropriate for some highly contaminated sites, we show through this pilot study that PCB exposure from moderately contaminated river sediments may be managed effectively through activated carbon amendment in sediments. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

TI  - DNA damage induced by genotoxicants in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos after contact exposure to freeze-dried sediment and sediment extracts from Laguna Lake (The Philippines) as measured by the comet assay
AB  - Laguna Lake, Philippines, is utilised as a resource for drinking and irrigation water and a major source of animal protein for more than 11 million residents. However, it also serves as a huge sink for anthropogenic pollutants from a variety of direct or indirect discharges. Given their well-known properties to accumulate organic pollutants, Lake Laguna sediments have been investigated by use of a newly developed sediment-contact assay to determine the bioavailable fraction of the total genotoxic hazard potential. Freshly fertilized zebrafish eggs (2 h after fertilization) were allowed to develop while exposed to different concentrations of freeze-dried sediments (exposure to bioavailable compounds) as well as organic extracts (complete genotoxic hazard potential including bioaccumulation) prepared from sediments collected at five sites within the lake. Following a 96 h exposure, single-cell suspensions were prepared from macerated larvae and analyzed for DNA strand-breaks by use of the comet assay. Genotoxicity could be identified in both solid-phase exposure scenarios as well as after exposure to organic sediment extracts. Only the South Bay (SB) site did not show a significant genotoxic burden relative to controls in tests of both freeze-dried sediment and organic extracts. In contrast, the Northwest Bay site displayed pronounced genotoxicity to the zebrafish embryos in both exposure scenarios. Perylene and copper in the sediments could be identified as potential causes of the genotoxic response. To compare the results (maximum induction coefficients) of zebrafish embryos with an established comet protocol, rainbow trout liver cells (RTL-W1) were exposed to the same extracts. The findings correlated well (Spearman correlation r = 0.90), proving a good reliability of the results from zebrafish primary cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the bioavailable fraction of the genotoxic pollutants may pose a threat for both benthic organisms and human health via drinking-water and fish consumption. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessing contamination levels of Laguna Lake sediments (Philippines) using a contact assay with zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - The present study investigated the suitability of a sediment contact assay using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to evaluate the degree of lake sediment contamination. As endpoints, developmental parameters (mortality, abnormality, heart rate, and hatching rate) as well as stress protein responses (hsp 70 levels) in the developing embryos were recorded during a 96-h exposure. Fertilized zebrafish eggs were exposed to both the whole as well as organic extract concentrations prepared from collected sediments from 5 sites along Laguna Lake, Philippines. Compared to whole sediment exposure, more severe embryotoxic and teratogenic responses were elicited in embryos exposed to organic extracts. However, since whole sediment-exposed embryos also revealed significant developmental defects, this exposure phase served as the more realistic exposure scenario in our study. Weak to strong upregulation of hsp 70 levels was also registered among embryos exposed to both whole sediments and organic extracts. The observed embryotoxic and proteotoxic responses by zebrafish embryos to Laguna Lake sediment exposures were discussed in relation to the analyzed contaminants in the sediments (heavy metals, PAHs (perylene), solvent). Overall, the present study points out that the sediment contact assay with zebrafish embryos offers a practicable and highly sensitive bioassay for the general assessment of sediment toxicity.

TI  - Metallothionein: Potential biomarker for monitoring heavy metal pollution in fish around Hong Kong
AB  - Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins that have a high affinity for divalent ions. Recently, MT level has become a major biomarker for monitoring metal pollution in fish. As a first step towards the development of a reliable and standard assay method for the detection of fish MTs in Hong Kong waters, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to obtain complementary DNAs (cDNAs) coding for goldfish (Carrasius auratus) and tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) MTs. Based on the cloned tilapia MT cDNA sequence, specific primers were designed to detect MT mRNA levels in tilapia tissues using RT-PCR. Screening of a common carp liver cDNA library also yielded MT cDNAs. For the development of an immuno-assay for monitoring MT levels in fish tissues, synthetic peptide, made according to the conserved teleost MT N-terminal amino acid sequences, was employed to raise anti-fish MT antibodies. These molecular and immunological probes will be useful in 1. testing the feasibility of using tilapia MT levels as a biomarker for monitoring metal pollution in Hong Kong fish and 2. determining the basic physiological significance of MT in metal tolerance in tilapia. © 1995.

TI  - Impaired gas bladder inflation in zebrafish exposed to a novel heterocyclic brominated flame retardant tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) Isocyanurate
AB  - The teleost gas bladder is a gas-filled internal organ that processes gas exchange and controls buoyancy. Here we report that an emerging heterocyclic brominated flame retardant, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate (TBC), causes defects in the inflation of the gas bladder of zebrafish larvae. This could cause impaired motility, which can ultimately lead to their death. Exposure to zebrafish embryos revealed that TBC had the most significant influence on the larvae at 72-96 h postfertilization, which coincided with the time that the gas bladder first inflates. Critical factors involved in early zebrafish gas bladder development remained at normal levels, which indicated that TBC caused defects in the inflation of the gas bladder without disrupting early organogenesis. However, the ultrastructure of the gas bladder was altered in the TBC-treated groups: the electron density of cytoplasmic vesicles was changed and the mitochondria were damaged. We deduce that TBC causes damage to mitochondria that influences the secretion of mucus-like material, resulting in defects in gas bladder inflation. For the first time, we report that the gas bladder could be a primary target organ for TBC, and assessment of the gas bladder should be included in toxicity testing protocols of zebrafish embryos. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Variability of sediment-contact tests in freshwater sediments with low-level anthropogenic contamination-Determination of toxicity thresholds
AB  - Freshwater sediments with low levels of anthropogenic contamination and a broad range of geochemical properties were investigated using various sediment-contact tests in order to study the natural variability and to define toxicity thresholds for the various toxicity endpoints. Tests were performed with bacteria (Arthrobacter globiformis), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), oligochaetes (Lumbriculus variegatus), higher plants (Myriophyllum aquaticum), and the eggs of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The variability in the response of some of the contact tests could be explained by particle size distribution and organic content. Only for two native sediments could a pollution effect not be excluded. Based on the minimal detectable difference (MDD) and the maximal tolerable inhibition (MTI), toxicity thresholds (% inhibition compared to the control) were derived for each toxicity parameter: >20% for plant growth and fish-egg survival, >25% for nematode growth and oligochaete reproduction, >50% for nematode reproduction and >60% for bacterial enzyme activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - From inflation to flotation: Contribution of the swimbladder to whole-body density and swimming depth during development of the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Teleost fishes have body tissues that are denser than water, causing them to sink. Many teleosts therefore possess a gas-filled swimbladder that provides lift, allowing fish to attain neutral buoyancy. The importance of the swimbladder as a buoyancy aid during changing body sizes over ontogeny and its role in determining the swimming depth of fish remain unclear. In this study, we have used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate changes in the size and shape of the swimbladder during development and examine whether these changes affect the hydrostatic contribution of the swimbladder during swimming. Our results showed that swim-up behavior is critical for larvae to first inflate their swimbladder, decrease body density, and attain neutral buoyancy. Following inflation, we found a strong linear correlation between fish volume and swimbladder volume over ontogeny. This trend was supported by measures of the density of zebrafish, which was conserved within a narrow range between 1.00±0.001 and 0.996±0.001g/cm3 despite an increase in the swimming depth of zebrafish, which occurred upon transition to a double-chambered organ. Finally, we demonstrated that the contribution of the swimbladder keeps the fish within 1.7% of neutral buoyancy throughout larval development. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - A single-cell transcriptome atlas for zebrafish development
AB  - The ability to define cell types and how they change during organogenesis is central to our understanding of animal development and human disease. Despite the crucial nature of this knowledge, we have yet to fully characterize all distinct cell types and the gene expression differences that generate cell types during development. To address this knowledge gap, we produced an atlas using single-cell RNA-sequencing methods to investigate gene expression from the pharyngula to early larval stages in developing zebrafish. Our single-cell transcriptome atlas encompasses transcriptional profiles from 44,102 ​cells across four days of development using duplicate experiments that confirmed high reproducibility. We annotated 220 identified clusters and highlighted several strategies for interrogating changes in gene expression associated with the development of zebrafish embryos at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we highlight the power of this analysis to assign new cell-type or developmental stage-specific expression information to many genes, including those that are currently known only by sequence and/or that lack expression information altogether. The resulting atlas is a resource for biologists to generate hypotheses for functional analysis, which we hope integrates with existing efforts to define the diversity of cell-types during zebrafish organogenesis, and to examine the transcriptional profiles that produce each cell type over developmental time. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Impact of gold nanoparticles on zebrafish exposed to a spiked sediment
AB  - Increasing use of metallic nanomaterials is likely to result in release of these particles into aquatic environments; nevertheless it is unclear whether these materials present a hazard to aquatic organisms. The impact of contaminated sediment containing 14-nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was investigated in the zebrafish Danio rerio exposed for 20 days to two concentrations, 16 and 55 μg/g dry weight. AuNPs were released from the sediment to the water column, and during this period the mean concentrations of AuNP in the filtered water fraction were 0.25 ± 0.05 and 0.8 ± 0.1 μg/L, respectively. A similar experiment with ionic gold contamination was simultaneously performed to obtain a positive control. AuNP exposure triggered various effects in fish tissues including modifications of genome composition, shown using a random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR genotoxicity test. Expression of genes involved in oxidative stress, mitochondrial metabolism, detoxification and DNA repair were also modulated in response to AuNP contamination. Gold altered neurotransmission, since brain acetylcholine esterase activity increased for both tested doses of AuNP but not for ionic gold. Gold accumulation in fish tissues demonstrated the lower bioavailability of AuNP compared to ionic Au, and underlined the higher toxic potential of the nanoparticle form. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

TI  - The versatile, changing, and advancing roles of fish in sediment toxicity assessment-a review
AB  - Purpose: Sediments serve as integral and dynamic parts of our aquatic systems. Within the last 15 to 20 years, however, the scientific community has begun noticing deterioration of sediment quality at an alarming rate worldwide. Sediments are now harboring hazardous pollutants that can directly influence water quality, thereby creating very stressful conditions for aquatic life. As a consequence, global efforts were initiated in the early 1970s, to find ways to assess sediment quality. Because of their obvious ecological and economic significance, fish have remained a major taxonomic group for appraising the general quality of aquatic systems. However, for sediment risk assessment, fish have lagged behind invertebrates due to their mobility and generally, pelagic lifestyle. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively presents and reviews the versatile role of fish in assessing the state of health of aquatic sediments. Main features: Through a literature search of the more relevant and/or more recent studies, this review attempted to trace the development of the various approaches as well as to describe the future prospects of using fish as sentinels for sediment quality assessment. Initially, the use of whole fish (juveniles or adults) bioassays contributed immensely to our understanding of sediment contamination and ecotoxicology. But due to economic as well as ethical issues linked to the use of live vertebrates for toxicity testing, the approach has shifted to using fish cell cultures and fish embryos. Much newer approaches involving receptors and gene arrays in fish cells to elucidate the mode of action of sediment-borne contaminants are very promising. The review paper also lists and explores some of the issues associated with the use of juvenile or adult fish, fish cell cultures, fish embryos, and fish gene expression profiles in sediment toxicity evaluations to stimulate further discussions, and hopefully, to serve as benchmark for future handling of similar or related aspects of fish utilization in sediment risk assessment. Conclusions and perspectives: Overall, the present review has comprehensively explored the changing and progressing roles of fish in sediment toxicity evaluation. Indeed the usefulness of this taxon as test organisms has provided a significant contribution to the advancement of sediment toxicology. However, despite the quite optimistic and bright future for these current procedures, a number of issues and problems remain. Therefore, efforts to develop new technologies and to refine current methods and approaches continue to challenge many laboratories worldwide. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Long-term disruption of growth, reproduction, and behavior after embryonic exposure of zebrafish to PAH-spiked sediment
AB  - A natural sediment spiked with three individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; pyrene, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene) was used to expose zebrafish embryos and larvae during 4 days. The total PAH concentration was 4.4 μg g−1 which is in the range found in sediment from contaminated areas. Quantification of metabolites in the larvae after exposure confirmed the actual contamination of the larvae and indicated an active metabolism especially for pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene. After a transfer in a clean medium, the larvae were reared to adulthood and evaluated for survival, growth, reproduction, and behavior. Measured endpoints revealed a late disruption of growth (appearing at 5 months) and a trend toward a lower reproductive ability. Adults of embryos exposed to sediment spiked with PAHs displayed lethargic and/or anxiety-like behaviors. This latter behavior was also identified in offspring at larval stage. All together, these effects could have detrimental consequences on fish performances and contribution to recruitment. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - The zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) for nanotoxicity assessment: from morphological to molecular approach
AB  - A critical review about the use of the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) on nanotoxicity assessments. © 2019 Elsevier LtdNanotechnology and use of nanomaterials (NMs) improve life quality, economic growth and environmental health. However, the increasing production and use of NMs in commercial products has led to concerns about their potential toxicity on human and environment health, as well as its toxicological classification and regulation. In this context, there is an urgent need to standardize and validate procedures for nanotoxicity testing. Since the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) has been indicated as a suitable approach for the toxicity assessment of traditional and emergent pollutants, the aim of this review is to summarize the existing literature on embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of NMs on zebrafish. In addition, morphological changes in zebrafish embryos induced by NMs were classified in four reaction models, allowing classification of the mode of action and toxicity of different types of NM. Revised data showed that the interaction and bioaccumulation of NMs on zebrafish embryos were associated to several toxic effects, while the detoxification process was limited. In general, NMs induced delayed hatching, circulatory changes, pigmentation and tegumentary alterations, musculoskeletal disorders and yolk sac alterations on zebrafish embryos. Recommendations for nanotoxicological tests are given, including guidance for future research. This review reinforces the use of the ZET as a suitable approach to assess the health risks of NM exposure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Differentiation between bioavailable and total hazard potential of sediment-induced DNA fragmentation as measured by the comet assay with zebrafish embryos
AB  - Goals, Scope and Background. While water quality strongly improved over decades in the Rhine River, sediments still reflect elapsed contaminations of organic pollutants and heavy metals. In comparing genotoxic effects induced by both sediment extracts and whole sediments, a ratio of bioavailable toxicity and total extractable toxicity is obtained. Since contaminated sites whose contaminants are toxic and as well bioavailable present an elevated risk to the ecosystem, such ratios may be used as a warning signal to identify sites of primary concern. Methods. Accordingly, two different exposure scenarios were compared to reveal the genotoxic potential of 18 sediment samples derived from 9 sample sites along the River Rhine. For assessment of effects on genome integrity, DNA fragmentation was measured using the comet assay with primary cells isolated from zebrafish embryos previously exposed to either organic sediment extracts or freeze-dried sediments at sublethal concentrations. Additionally, chemical data were used to determine responsible pollutants and correlate them with biological effects. Results. Whereas 17 out of 18 sediment extracts caused significant DNA damage to the embryo cells, only 4 native sediments showed a genotoxic potential. Thus, under field-like exposure conditions, a major part of potentially genotoxic compounds seem to remain particle-bound and ineffective, as shown for whole sediment exposure. Conversely, the organic extracts seem to contain enriched concentrations even of hardly soluble substances. Hence, organic extracts may be used as a screening tool to address potentially polluted sites, even though the relevance of these results for the field situation may be questionable. Investigations on native sediments determined few sites with bioavailable and therefore ecologically most relevant genotoxic sediment compounds. Discussion. However, these results may underestimate the total hazard potential of sample sites with hardly bioavailable substances. Chemical data revealed a variety of anthropogenic pollutants, ranging from PAHs to heavy metals. Nevertheless, chemical data on the measured priority pollutants did not fully explain the pollution pattern of the bioassays but clearly determined substances of concern (e.g., HCB, heavy metals) in particular sample sites. Conclusions. There is a striking advantage in assessing the genotoxicity by means of different exposure scenarios that focus on either bioavailable or extractable fractions, as the combination of the results allows obtaining information on specific properties of the genotoxicants and their bioavailability. An additional correlation with chemical data should be required to identify priority pollutants, as long as the responsible contaminant is known a priori. As many studies revealed inherent failures of such a correlation, an effect-driven analysis of pollutants is recommended as a promising tool to identify even non-priority pollutants by means of their ecotoxicological effectiveness. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH), D-86899 Landsberg and Tokyo.

TI  - A novel contact assay for testing aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated toxicity of chemicals and whole sediments in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - The European Water Framework Directive aims to achieve a good ecological and chemical status in surface waters until 2015. Sediment toxicology plays a major role in this intention as sediments can act as a secondary source of pollution. In order to fulfill this legal obligation, there is an urgent need to develop whole-sediment exposure protocols, since sediment contact assays represent the most realistic scenario to simulate in situ exposure conditions. Therefore, in the present study, a vertebrate sediment contact assay to determine aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated activity of particle-bound pollutants was developed. Furthermore, the activity and the expression of the CYP1 family in early life stages of zebrafish after exposure to freeze-dried sediment samples were investigated. In order to validate the developed protocol, effects of β-naphthoflavone and three selected sediment on zebrafish embryos were investigated. Results documented clearly AhR-mediated toxicity after exposure to β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) and to the sediment from the Vering canal. Upregulation of mRNA levels was observed for all investigated sediment samples. The highest levels of all investigated cyp genes (cyp1a, cyp1b1, cyp1c1, and cyp1c2) were recorded after exposure to the sediment sample of the Vering canal. In conclusion, the newly developed sediment contact assay can be recommended for the investigation of dioxin-like activities of single substances and the bioavailable fraction of complex environmental samples. Moreover, the exposure of whole zebrafish embryos to native (freeze-dried) sediment samples represents a highly realistic and ecologically relevant exposure scenario. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Effects of sediment eluates and extracts from differently polluted small rivers on zebrafish embryos and larvae
AB  - The effects on newly fertilized eggs, embryos and larvae of zebrafish Danio rerio following exposure to sediment samples from the more heavily contaminated River Körsch, southern Germany, occurred earlier and were more prominent than in samples from the less contaminated Krähenbach. Dose- and time-related effects following exposure to Körsch sediment eluates and extracts included: (1) hatching failure and subsequent death of larvae exposed to undiluted aqueous sediment eluates and reduced hatching rates at sediment extract concentrations ≥0.0125%; (2) increased mortality after exposure to 25 and 50% dilutions of aqueous sediment eluates, and dilutions of ≥0.00625% sediment extracts; (3) reduction of heart beat frequency for 50% dilutions of sediment eluates and concentrations of ≥0.025% extracts; (4) increased frequency of heart and yolk sac oedema after exposure to ≥0.0125% sediment extracts. Since adverse effects of sediment extracts observed in zebrafish laboratory tests correlated with reproductive failure in natural populations of brown trout Salmo trutta f. fario in the severely polluted River Körsch, early life stages tests with zebrafish appear to be a suitable tool to assess the contamination rate of natural sediments. © 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

TI  - Sediment contact tests as a tool for the assessment of sediment quality in German waters
AB  - A sediment contact test (SCT) battery consisting of five ecotoxicological test systems was applied to 21 native freshwater sediments characterized by a broad variety of geochemical properties and anthropogenic contamination. Higher plants (Myriophyllum aquaticum), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), oligochaetes (Lumbriculus variegatus), zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio), and bacteria (Arthrobacter globiformis), representing various trophic levels and exposure pathways, were used as test organisms. The test battery detected sediment toxicity caused by anthropogenic pollution, whereas the various tests provided site-specific, nonredundant information to the overall toxicity assessment. Based on the toxicity pattern derived from the test battery, the sediments were classified according to a newly proposed classification system for sediment toxicity assessment. The SCT-derived classification generally agreed well with the application of consensus-based sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), especially with regard to sediments with high toxic potential. For sediments with low to medium toxic potential, the SQGs often underestimated the toxicity that was detected by the SCTs, underpinning the need for toxicity tests in sediment quality assessment. © 2012 SETAC.

TI  - Evaluation of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and teratogenicity of marine sediments from Qingdao coastal areas using in vitro fish cell assay, comet assay and zebrafish embryo test
AB  - Marine sediments are often a final sink for numerous anthropogenic contaminants and may impose serious effects on benthic organisms and ecosystem. An in vitro cell assay using a cell line derived from flounder gill (FG) cells, an in vitro comet assay in FG cells, and an in vitro zebrafish embryo assay were used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity (measured by MTT reduction), genotoxicity and teratogenicity of crude sediment extracts of Li Cang (LC), Zhan Qiao (ZQ) and Olympic Sailing Center (OSC) from Qingdao coastal area. Sediments from the three sites displayed different cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and teratogenicity potencies; however, all three assays yielded similar LOECs (lowest observed effect concentration) for each site, suggesting that the assays were equally sensitive to and suitable for initial screening of the LOECs of marine sediments. The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and teratogenicity for these three sampling sites were in the same order of LC > ZQ > OSC, indicating different degrees of contamination. Interestingly, trials with the three sediment extracts at the doses inducing a similar cytotoxicity as evaluated with MTT reduction did not produce similar genotoxicity and teratogenicity, with the genotoxic and teratogenic activities of LC and ZQ extracts being markedly higher than those of OSC sediments. These findings indicate that cytotoxicity does not form a fully equivalent toxicity index with that of genotoxicity and teratogenicity. Therefore, in order to assess the true toxic potential of marine sediments, all three assays should be performed. Analysis of 16 EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) priority PAHs in these three sediment samples showed a clear correlation between PAH concentrations and sediment toxicities, with a higher PAH content corresponding to higher toxicity although PAHs are surely not the only cause. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sediment and salinity effects on the bioaccumulation of sulfamethoxazole in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - The dynamic distribution of a widely used antibiotic sulfamethoxazole between water, sediment and aquatic organisms (zebrafish) was studied in microcosms. Sulfamethoxazole concentrations in water were gradually reduced, while in sediment and zebrafish gradually increased, suggesting active adsorption and bioaccumulation processes occurring. The presence of sediment particles and their interactions with water reduced the bioaccumulation of sulfamethoxazole in zebrafish by 13–28%. The sediment of smaller particle size with more organic carbon content and higher surface area, adsorbed sulfamethoxazole more extensively and decreased its bioaccumulation most significantly. The effect became more severe with increasing salinity in water due to the salting out of sulfamethoxazole, resulting in 24–33% reduction in bioaccumulation. At equilibrium, the distribution of sulfamethoxazole in different phases was quantified, with most sulfamethoxazole being associated with water (97.3%), followed by sedimentary phase (2.7%) and finally zebrafish (0.05%). The findings provided important data for further research into antibiotics fate and bio-uptake in aquatic organisms, and subsequent ecotoxicity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of BDE-209 contaminated sediments on zebrafish development and potential implications to human health
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are compounds widely used as flame-retardants, which are of increasing environmental concern due to their persistence, and potential adverse effects. This study had two objectives. First, we assessed if BDE-209 in sediment was bioavailable and bioaccumulated into zebrafish embryos. Secondly, we assessed the potential impact on human and environmental health of bioavailable BDE-209 using human in vitro cell assays and zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish were exposed from 4. h to 8. days post-fertilization to sediments spiked with 12.5. mg/kg of BDE-209. Zebrafish larvae accumulated ten fold more BDE-209 than controls in unspiked sediment after 8. days. BDE-209 impacted expression of neurological pathways and altered behavior of larvae, although BDE-209 had no visible affect on thyroid function or motoneuron and neuromast development. Zebrafish data and in silico predictions suggested that BDE-209 would also interact with key human transcription factors and receptors. We therefore tested these predictions using mammalian in vitro assays. BDE-209 activated human aryl hydrocarbon receptor, peroxisome proliferator activating receptors, CF/b-cat, activator protein 1, Oct-MLP, and the estrogen receptor-related alpha (ERRα) receptor in cell-based assays. BDE-209 also inhibited human acetylcholinesterase activity. The observation that BDE-209 can be bioaccumulated from contaminated sediment highlights the need to consider this as a potential environmental exposure route. Once accumulated, our data also show that BDE-209 has the potential to cause impacts on both human and environmental health. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The value of zebrafish as an integrative model in effect-directed analysis - a review
AB  - Bioassays play a central role in effect-directed analysis (EDA), and their selection and application have to consider rather specific aspects of this approach. Meanwhile, bioassays with zebrafish, an established model organism in different research areas, are increasingly being utilized in EDA. Aiming to contribute for the optimal application of zebrafish bioassays in EDA, this review provides a critical overview of previous EDA investigations that applied zebrafish bioassays, discusses the potential contribution of such methods for EDA and proposes strategies to improve future studies. Over the last 10 years, zebrafish bioassays have guided EDA of natural products and environmental samples. The great majority of studies performed bioassays with embryos and early larvae, which allowed small-scale and low-volume experimental setups, minimized sample use and reduced workload. Biotesting strategies applied zebrafish bioassays as either the only method guiding EDA or instead integrated into multiple bioassay approaches. Furthermore, tiered biotesting applied zebrafish methods in both screening phase as well as for further investigations. For dosing, most of the studies performed solvent exchange of extracts and fractions to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as carrier. However, high DMSO concentrations were required for the testing of complex matrix extracts, indicating that future studies might benefit from the evaluation of alternative carrier solvents or passive dosing. Surprisingly, only a few studies reported the evaluation of process blanks, indicating a need to improve and standardize methods for blank preparation and biotesting. Regarding evaluated endpoints, while acute toxicity brought limited information, the assessment of specific endpoints was of strong value for bioactivity identification. Therefore, the bioassay specificity and sensitivity to identify the investigated bioactivity are important criteria in EDA. Additionally, it might be necessary to characterize the most adequate exposure windows and assessment setups for bioactivity identification. Finally, a great advantage of zebrafish bioassays in EDA of environmental samples is the availability of mechanism- and endpoint-specific methods for the identification of important classes of contaminants. The evaluation of mechanism-specific endpoints in EDA is considered to be a promising strategy to facilitate the integration of EDA into weight-of-evidence approaches, ultimately contributing for the identification of environmental contaminants causing bioassay and ecological effects. © 2015, Di Paolo et al.; licensee Springer.

TI  - In situ treatment with activated carbon reduces bioaccumulation in aquatic food chains
AB  - In situ activated carbon (AC) amendment is a new direction in contaminated sediment management, yet its effectiveness and safety have never been tested on the level of entire food chains including fish. Here we tested the effects of three different AC treatments on hydrophobic organic chemical (HOC) concentrations in pore water, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, and fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus). AC treatments were mixing with powdered AC (PAC), mixing with granular AC (GAC), and addition-removal of GAC (sediment stripping). The AC treatments resulted in a significant decrease in HOC concentrations in pore water, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, macrophytes, and fish. In 6 months, PAC treatment caused a reduction of accumulation of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) in fish by a factor of 20, bringing pollutant levels below toxic thresholds. All AC treatments supported growth of fish, but growth was inhibited in the PAC treatment, which was likely explained by reduced nutrient concentrations, resulting in lower zooplankton (i.e., food) densities for the fish. PAC treatment may be advised for sites where immediate ecosystem protection is required. GAC treatment may be equally effective in the longer term and may be adequate for vulnerable ecosystems where longer-term protection suffices. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Lagos lagoon sediment organic extracts and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons induce embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic effects in Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos
AB  - An expansion of anthropogenic activity around Lagos lagoon, Nigeria, has raised concerns over increasing contaminants entering the lagoon’s ecosystem. The embryotoxicity, teratogenicity and genotoxicity of sediment organic extracts from four sampling zones around Lagos lagoon, Ilaje, Iddo, Atlas Cove and Apapa, as well as the dominant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) identified in water measured during the wet season (naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and a mixture of these), were assessed with Danio rerio embryos. Embryos were exposed to varying concentrations of toxicants from 0–72 h post-fertilization (hpf). Embryotoxicity at 72 hpf showed a dose-dependent increase in mortality upon exposure to extracts from all zones, except Atlas Cove. Similarly, higher levels of teratogenic effects, such as increased oedema, and haemorrhage and developmental abnormalities resulted from exposure to extracts from Ilaje, Iddo and Apapa zones. Treatment with single PAHs revealed that significant levels of detrimental effects were obtained only for phenanthrene. The modified comet assay revealed that the oxidative damage to DNA was generally low (<12 %) overall for all sediment extracts, but was significantly elevated with Ilaje and Iddo sediment extracts when compared with solvent controls. Oxidative damage was observed with the single PAHs, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene, as well as with the PAH mixture. This study highlights that Lagos lagoon sediment extracts have teratogenic, embryotoxic and genotoxic properties, which are likely due to the high molecular weight PAHs present in the extracts, some of which are known or are suspected human carcinogens. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - Impaired anterior swim bladder inflation following exposure to the thyroid peroxidase inhibitor 2-mercaptobenzothiazole part II: Zebrafish
AB  - Disruption of the thyroid hormone (TH) system, an important mode of action, can lead to ecologically relevant adverse outcomes, especially during embryonic development. The present study characterizes the effects of disruption of TH synthesis on swim bladder inflation during zebrafish early-life stages using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), a thyroid peroxidase (TPO) inhibitor. Zebrafish were exposed to different MBT concentrations until 120/168 h post fertilization (hpf) and 32 days post fertilization (dpf), in two sets of experiments, to investigate the effects of TPO inhibition on posterior and anterior swim bladder inflation respectively, as well as whole body thyroid hormone concentrations (triiodothyronine (T3) and its prohormone, thyroxine (T4)). At 120 hpf, MBT did not directly impair posterior chamber inflation or size, while anterior chamber inflation and size was impaired at 32 dpf. As previously shown in amphibians and mammals, we confirmed that MBT inhibits TPO in fish. Whole-body T4 decreased after MBT exposure at both time points, while T3 levels were unaltered. There was a significant relationship between T4 levels and the anterior chamber surface at 32 dpf. The absence of effects on posterior chamber inflation can possibly be explained by maternal transfer of T4 into the eggs. These maternally derived THs are depleted at 32 dpf and cannot offset TPO inhibition, resulting in impaired anterior chamber inflation. Therefore, we hypothesize that TPO inhibition only inhibits swim bladder inflation during late development, after depletion of maternally derived T4. In a previous study, we showed that iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) knockdown impaired posterior chamber inflation during early development. Our findings, in parallel with similar effects observed in fathead minnow (see part I, this issue) suggest that thyroid disruption impacts swim bladder inflation, and imply an important distinction among specific subtypes of TH disrupting chemicals. However, the existence of another - yet unknown - mode of action of MBT impacting swim bladder inflation cannot be excluded. These results can be helpful for delineating adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) linking TPO inhibition, ID inhibition and other TH related molecular initiating events, to impaired swim bladder inflation in fish during early life stages. Such AOPs can support the use of in vitro enzyme inhibition assays for predicting reduced survival due to impaired posterior and anterior chamber inflation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Time-dependent expression and activity of cytochrome P450 1s in early life-stages of the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Zebrafish embryos are being increasingly used as model organisms for the assessment of single substances and complex environmental samples for regulatory purposes. Thus, it is essential to fully understand the xenobiotic metabolism during the different life-stages of early development. The aim of the present study was to determine arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated activity during selected times of early development using qPCR, enzymatic activity through measurement of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and protein expression analysis. In the present study, gene expression of cyp1a, cyp1b1, cyp1c1, cyp1c2, and ahr2 as well as EROD activity were investigated up to 120 h postfertilization (hpf) after exposure to either β-naphthoflavone (BNF) or a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-contaminated sediment extract from Vering Kanal in Hamburg (VK). Protein expression was measured at 72 hpf after exposure to 20 μg/L BNF. Altered proteins were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) peptide mass fingerprinting. Distinct patterns of basal messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were found for each of the cyp1 genes, suggesting specific roles during embryonic development. All transcripts were induced by BNF and VK. ahr2 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated after exposure to VK. All cyp1 genes investigated showed a temporal decline in expression at 72 hpf. The significant decline of Hsp 90β protein at 72 hpf after exposure to BNF may suggest an explanation for the decline of cyp1 genes at this time point as Hsp 90β is of major importance for the functioning of the Ah-receptor. EROD activity measured in embryos was significantly induced after 96 hpf of exposure to BNF or VK. Together, these results demonstrate distinct temporal patterns of cyp1 genes and protein activities in zebrafish embryos as well as show a need to investigate further the xenobiotic biotransformation system during early development of zebrafish. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Comparative sensitivity of embryo-larval toxicity assays with African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and zebra fish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Embryo-larval toxicity tests with the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were conducted with five chemicals (Cr, Cd, Zn, NaPCP and malathion) and three environmental samples. The sensitivity of the 5-day assay was compared to that of the 12-day embryo-larval toxicity tests with the zebra fish (Danio rerio). The ratios of the C. gariepinus and D. rerio LC50 values ranged from 0.4 for Cr to 8.9 for Zn. The ratios of subchronic values ranged from 0.25 for NaPCP to 3.1 for Cd indicating a more comparable sensitivity of the two species. For the three sediment pore waters, the ratios were 0.6, 1.1, and 2.4 and the subchronic values were identical for the two species. The results suggest that, considering the short-test duration and its sensitivity, the 5-day embryo-larval tests with C. gariepinus may be a potential alternative for short-term embryo-larval toxicity testing with fish. © 2001 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

TI  - Perfluoropolyether carboxylic acids (novel alternatives to PFOA) impair zebrafish posterior swim bladder development via thyroid hormone disruption
AB  - Perfluoropolyether carboxylic acids (PFECAs, CF3(OCF2)nCOO−, n = 2–5) are novel alternatives to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and are widely used in industrial production. However, although they have been detected in surface water and human blood, their toxicities on aquatic organisms remain unknown. We used zebrafish embryos to compare the developmental toxicities of various PFECAs (e.g., perfluoro (3,5,7-trioxaoctanoic) acid (PFO3OA), perfluoro (3,5,7,9-tetraoxadecanoic) acid (PFO4DA), and perfluoro (3,5,7,9,11-pentaoxadodecanoic) acid (PFO5DoDA)) with that of PFOA and to further reveal the key events related to toxicity caused by these chemicals. Results showed that, based on half maximal effective concentrations (EC50), toxicity increased in the order: PFO5DoDA &gt; PFO4DA &gt; PFOA &gt; PFO3OA, with uninflated posterior swim bladders the most frequently observed malformation. Similar to PFOA, PFECA exposure significantly lowered thyroid hormone (TH) levels (e.g., T3 (3,5,3′-L-triiodothyronine) and T4 (L-thyroxine)) in the whole body of larvae at 5 d post-fertilization following disrupted TH metabolism. In addition, the transcription of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family a, b (ugt1ab), a gene related to TH metabolism, increased dose-dependently. Exogeneous T3 or T4 supplementation partly rescued PFECA-induced posterior swim bladder malformation. Our results further suggested that PFECAs primarily damaged the swim bladder mesothelium during early development. This study is the first to report on novel emerging PFECAs as thyroid disruptors causing swim bladder malformation. Furthermore, given that PFECA toxicity increased with backbone OCF2 moieties, they may not be safer alternatives to PFOA. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Assessment of urban stream sediment pollutants entering estuaries using chemical analysis and multiple bioassays to characterise biological activities
AB  - Stormwater contaminants are a major source of often neglected environmental stressors because of the emphasis placed on the management of municipal and industrial wastewaters. Stormwater-derived pollutants in sediments from two New Zealand estuaries was characterised by analytical chemistry and bioassays. Contaminants were extracted from sediment using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), recovered and concentrated by solid phase extraction (SPE), and analysed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), selected metals, and musk fragrances. The concentrations of PAHs were below the ANZECC Interim Sediment Quality Guideline values while those of lead and zinc exceeded them in some samples. The sediment extracts containing organic contaminants exhibited acute toxicity in the zebrafish fish embryo toxicity (FET) and teratogenicity, induction of biotransformation (EROD activity), and genotoxicity (comet assay) in zebrafish. The potential of the extracts to interact with endocrine signalling processes was assessed by GeneBLAzer reporter gene bioassays and they exhibited estrogenic, androgenic, and anti-progestagenic activities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect-directed analysis for estrogenic compounds in a fluvial sediment sample using transgenic cyp19a1b-GFP zebrafish embryos
AB  - Xenoestrogens may persist in the environment by binding to sediments or suspended particulate matter serving as long-term reservoir and source of exposure, particularly for organisms living in or in contact with sediments. In this study, we present for the first time an effect-directed analysis (EDA) for identifying estrogenic compounds in a sediment sample using embryos of a transgenic reporter fish strain. In the tg(cyp19a1b-GFP) transgenic zebrafish strain, the expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein) in the brain is driven by an oestrogen responsive element in the promoter of the cyp19a1b (aromatase) gene. The selected sediment sample of the Czech river Bilina had already been analysed in a previous EDA using the yeast oestrogen screening assay and had revealed fractions containing estrogenic compounds. When normal phase HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) fractionation was used for the separation of the sediment sample, the biotest with transgenic fish embryos revealed two estrogenic fractions. Chemical analysis of candidate compounds in these sediment fractions suggested alkylphenols and estrone as candidate compounds responsible for the observed estrogenic effect. Alkylphenol concentrations could partially explain the estrogenicity of the fractions. However, xenoestrogens below the analytical detection limit or non-targeted estrogenic compounds have probably also contributed to the sample's estrogenic potency. The results indicated the suitability of the tg(cyp19a1b-GFP) fish embryo for an integrated chemical-biological analysis of estrogenic effects. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Toxicity and Transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-seq) Analyses of Adult Zebrafish in Response to Exposure Carboxymethyl Cellulose Stabilized Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles
AB  - Increasing utilization of stabilized iron sulfides (FeS) nanoparticles implies an elevated release of the materials into the environment. To understand potential impacts and underlying mechanisms of nanoparticle-induced stress, we used the transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technique to characterize the transcriptomes from adult zebrafish exposed to 10 mg/L carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized FeS nanoparticles for 96 h, demonstrating striking differences in the gene expression profiles in liver. The exposure caused significant expression alterations in genes related to immune and inflammatory responses, detoxification, oxidative stress and DNA damage/repair. The complement and coagulation cascades Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway was found significantly up-regulated under nanoparticle exposure. The quantitative real-Time polymerase chain reaction using twelve genes confirmed the RNA-seq results. We identified several candidate genes commonly regulated in liver, which may serve as gene indicators when exposed to the nanoparticles. Hepatic inflammation was further confirmed by histological observation of pyknotic nuclei, and vacuole formation upon exposure. Tissue accumulation tests showed a 2.2 times higher iron concentration in the fish tissue upon exposure. This study provides preliminary mechanistic insights into potential toxic effects of organic matter stabilized FeS nanoparticles, which will improve our understanding of the genotoxicity caused by stabilized nanoparticles. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - In vivo EROD assays with the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as rapid screening tools for the detection of dioxin-like activity
AB  - The present study compares two alternative in vivo approaches for the measurement of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) following exposure to acetonic model sediment extracts: (1) the live-imaging EROD assay for the direct detection of EROD induction in individual livers via epifluorescence, and (2) the fish embryo EROD assay in subcellular fractions derived from entire zebrafish embryos after in vivo exposure. For toxicity assessment, each sediment extract was tested with the standard fish embryo test (FET). Upon completion of a functioning liver after 72 h, the embryos gave a distinct fluorescent signal in the liver, and a corresponding EROD activity could be detected in the fish embryo EROD assay. The exposure time in the live-imaging EROD assay was reduced to 3 h, which resulted in a stronger, less variable and more sensitive EROD response. Overall, the live-imaging and the fish embryo EROD assays showed the same tendencies and gave comparable results, e.g. a concentration-dependent increase in EROD activity at concentrations one order of magnitude below concentrations producing macroscopically visible abnormalities. At higher concentrations, however, a decrease of EROD activity was observed in either test. Both tests ranked the three model sediment extracts in the same order. Results indicate that both test systems complement each other and together provide a rapid and reliable in vivo tool to investigate the presence of dioxin-like substances in environmental samples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Embryotoxic and genotoxic effects of sewage effluents in zebrafish embryo using multiple endpoint testing
AB  - Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are often complex mixtures of various organic and inorganic substances. Quality control of wastewaters and sludges has been regulated with measuring several physico-chemical parameters and sometimes using biological methods with non-specific responses, while synergistic action mechanisms of contaminants in such complex mixtures is still unknown. Toxic effects of wastewaters within and downstream of the WWTP in City of Virovitica, Croatia, were tested on zebrafish Danio rerio using a set of biomarkers that enabled an insight in wastewaters toxic potential on embryos at the cellular, tissue and the whole organism level during an early ontogenesis (24 and 48 hpf). Exposure of embryos to the wastewater samples from WWTP Virovitica increased mortality and abnormality rate. Heart rate, spontaneous movements and pigmentation formation were also markedly affected. Biochemical markers confirmed the presence of MXR inhibitors in all tested wastewater samples, indicating the increase of pollutant accumulation in the cell/organism. Also, a tendency of DNA damage decrease measured with Comet assay was evident in wastewater samples downstream from WWTP although control levels were not reached in any environmental sample. Histopathological analysis showed that exposure to tested samples resulted in impaired muscle organization, notochord malformation and retardation in eye and brain development at embryos 48 hpf. Furthermore, semi-quantitative histopathology assessment indicated increased percentage of embryo defects in river water sampled several kilometers downstream from the WWTP, confirming toxic potential of WWTP effluents. Extension of the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) with biochemical and histopathological biomarkers could serve as a guiding principle in biomonitoring of wastewater contamination. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The classification of motor neuron defects in the zebrafish embryo toxicity test (ZFET) as an animal alternative approach to assess developmental neurotoxicity
AB  - Rodents are widely used to test the developmental neurotoxicity potential of chemical substances. The regulatory test procedures are elaborate and the requirement of numerous animals is ethically disputable. Therefore, non-animal alternatives are highly desirable, but appropriate test systems that meet regulatory demands are not yet available. Hence, we have developed a new developmental neurotoxicity assay based on specific whole-mount immunostainings of primary and secondary motor neurons (using the monoclonal antibodies znp1 and zn8) in zebrafish embryos. By classifying the motor neuron defects, we evaluated the severity of the neurotoxic damage to individual primary and secondary motor neurons caused by chemical exposure and determined the corresponding effect concentration values (EC50). In a proof-of-principle study, we investigated the effects of three model compounds thiocyclam, cartap and disulfiram, which show some neurotoxicity-indicating effects in vertebrates, and the positive controls ethanol and nicotine and the negative controls 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and triclosan. As a quantitative measure of the neurotoxic potential of the test compounds, we calculated the ratios of the EC50 values for motor neuron defects and the cumulative malformations, as determined in a zebrafish embryo toxicity test (zFET). Based on this index, disulfiram was classified as the most potent and thiocyclam as the least potent developmental neurotoxin. The index also confirmed the control compounds as positive and negative neurotoxicants. Our findings demonstrate that this index can be used to reliably distinguish between neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic chemicals and provide a sound estimate for the neurodevelopmental hazard potential of a chemical. The demonstrated method can be a feasible approach to reduce the number of animals used in developmental neurotoxicity evaluation procedures. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Simulation of the chemical fate and bioavailability of liquid elemental mercury drops from gold mining in Amazonian freshwater systems
AB  - Elemental mercury (Hg°) for gold amalgamation is the main process applied by artisanal gold miners in South America, leading to important discharges into freshwater ecosystems. Through a 28-day experimental approach based on indoor microcosms, we simulated the chemical fate and bioavailability of Hg° droplets in the presence or absence of sediment collected from a typical forest creek that is unaffected by gold mining activities. Our results clearly showed significant mercury transfers in the water column in both the dissolved gaseous Hg° and oxidized (Hg(II)) forms, with a marked effect of the presence of sediment. After 28 days, Hg total (HgT) concentration in the water column was 25 times higher in sediment-free units (108 ± 17 vs 4 ± 0.4 nM). Methylmercury (MeHg) determinations in the dissolved fraction showed a significant increase only in the presence of sediment after 7 and 14 days. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used as indicators for mercury bioavailability. The HgT determinations in four organs revealed significant accumulation levels as early as 7 days exposure, with marked differences in favor of fish collected from the sediment-free units. Significant MeHg increases were observed in the four organs only when sediment was present. Genomic tools applied to estimate sulfate-reducing bacteria communities showed mercury impacts on their diversity and distribution in the different compartments (water, sediment, biofilm, fish gut). © 2007 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Influence of sediment composition on PAH toxicity using zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryo-larval assays
AB  - Due to hydrophobic and persistent properties, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have a high capacity to accumulate in sediment. Sediment quality criteria, for the assessment of habitat quality and risk for aquatic life, include understanding the fate and effects of PAHs. In the context of European regulation (REACH and Water Framework Directive), the first objective was to assess the influence of sediment composition on the toxicity of two model PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene using 10-day zebrafish embryo-larval assay. This procedure was undertaken with an artificial sediment in order to limit natural sediment variability. A suitable sediment composition might be then validated for zebrafish and proposed in a new OECD guideline for chemicals testing. Second, a comparative study of toxicity responses from this exposure protocol was then performed using another OECD species, the Japanese medaka. The potential toxicity of both PAHs was assessed through lethal (e.g., survival, hatching success) and sublethal endpoints (e.g., abnormalities, PMR, and EROD) measured at different developmental stages, adapted to the embryonic development time of both species. Regarding effects observed for both species, a suitable artificial sediment composition for PAH toxicity testing was set at 92.5 % dry weight (dw) silica of 0.2–0.5-mm grain size, 5 % dw kaolin clay without organic matter for zebrafish, and 2.5 % dw blond peat in more only for Japanese medaka. PAH bioavailability and toxicity were highly dependent on the fraction of organic matter in sediment and of the Kow coefficients of the tested compounds. The biological responses observed were also dependent of the species under consideration. Japanese medaka embryos appeared more robust than zebrafish embryos for understanding the toxicity of PAHs following a sediment contact test, due to the longer exposure duration and lower sensitivity of sediment physical properties. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - A combined DNA-microarray and mechanism-specific toxicity approach with zebrafish embryos to investigate the pollution of river sediments
AB  - The zebrafish embryo has repeatedly proved to be a useful model for the analysis of effects by environmental toxicants. This proof-of-concept study was performed to investigate if an approach combining mechanism-specific bioassays with microarray techniques can obtain more in-depth insights into the ecotoxicity of complex pollutant mixtures as present, e.g., in sediment extracts. For this end, altered gene expression was compared to data from established bioassays as well as to results from chemical analysis. Mechanism-specific biotests indicated a defined hazard potential of the sediment extracts, and microarray analysis revealed several classes of significantly regulated genes which could be related to the hazard potential. Results indicate that potential classes of contaminants can be assigned to sediment extracts by both classical biomarker genes and corresponding expression profile analyses of known substances. However, it is difficult to distinguish between specific responses and more universal detoxification of the organism. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

TI  - Incorporating zebrafish omics into chemical biology and toxicology
AB  - In this communication, we describe the general aspects of omics approaches for analyses of transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, and how they can be strategically incorporated into chemical screening and perturbation studies using the zebrafish system. Pharmacological efficacy and selectivity of chemicals can be evaluated based on chemical-induced phenotypic effects; however, phenotypic observation has limitations in identifying mechanistic action of chemicals. We suggest adapting gene-expression-based high-throughput screening as a complementary strategy to zebrafish-phenotype-based screening for mechanistic insights about the mode of action and toxicity of a chemical, large-scale predictive applications and comparative analysis of chemical-induced omics signatures, which are useful to identify conserved biological responses, signaling pathways, and biomarkers. The potential mechanistic, predictive, and comparative applications of omics approaches can be implemented in the zebrafish system. Examples of these using the omics approaches in zebrafish, including data of ours and others, are presented and discussed. Omics also facilitates the translatability of zebrafish studies across species through comparison of conserved chemical-induced responses. This review is intended to update interested readers with the current omics approaches that have been applied in chemical studies on zebrafish and their potential in enhancing discovery in chemical biology. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Trophic transfer of Cd from larval chironomids (Chironomus riparius) exposed via sediment or waterborne routes, to zebrafish (Danio rerio): Tissue-specific and subcellular comparisons
AB  - Zebrafish were fed chironomid larvae (8% wet weight daily ration) for 7 days, followed by 3 days of gut clearance in a static-renewal system. Regardless of whether the chironomids had been loaded with Cd via a waterborne exposure or sediment exposure, they had similar subcellular distributions of Cd, with the largest areas of storage being metal rich granules (MRG) > organelles (ORG) > enzymes (ENZ) except that sediment-exposed chironomids had significantly more Cd in the metallothionein-like protein (MTLP) fraction, and significantly less Cd in the cellular debris (CD) fraction. When zebrafish fed sediment-exposed chironomids (153 ± 11 μg Cd/g dry weight) were compared directly to zebrafish fed waterborne exposed chironomids (288 ± 12 μg Cd/g dry weight), identical whole-body Cd levels were observed, despite the difference in the concentration in the food source. Thus trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) of Cd was significantly greater from sediment-exposed chironomids (2.0 ± 0.5%) than from waterborne-exposed chironomids (0.7 ± 0.2%). Subsequent tests with waterborne exposed chironomids loaded to comparable Cd concentrations, as well as with Cd-spiked manufactured pellets, demonstrated that TTEs were concentration-independent. In all treatments, zebrafish exhibited similar subcellular storage of Cd, with the greatest uptake occurring in the ORG fraction followed by the ENZ fraction. However, neither trophically available metal (TAM) nor metabolically available fractions (MAF) were good predictors for the TTEs found in this study. Tissue Cd concentrations were highest in the kidney and gut tissue, then liver, but lower in the gill, and carcass. Overall, the gut and carcass contributed ≥71% to total body burdens on a mass-weighted basis. This study presents evidence that Cd may be acquired by fish from natural diets at levels of environmental relevance for contaminated sites, and that the exposure route of the prey influences the TTE. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The transcriptome of the zebrafish embryo after chemical exposure: A meta-analysis
AB  - Numerous studies have been published in the past years investigating the transcriptome of the zebrafish embryo (ZFE) upon being subjected to chemical stress. Aiming at a more mechanistic understanding of the results of such studies, knowledge about commonalities of transcript regulation in response to chemical stress is needed. Thus, our goal in this study was to identify and interpret genes and gene sets constituting a general response to chemical exposure. Therefore, we aggregated and reanalyzed published toxicogenomics data obtained with the ZFE. We found that overlap of differentially transcribed genes in response to chemical stress across independent studies is generally low and the most commonly differentially transcribed genes appear in less than 50% of all treatments across studies. However, effect size analysis revealed several genes showing a common trend of differential expression, among which genes related to calcium homeostasis emerged as key, especially in exposure settings up to 24h post-fertilization. Additionally, we found that these and other downregulated genes are often linked to anatomical regions developing during the respective exposure period. Genes showing a trend of increased expression were, among others, linked to signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt, Fgf) as well as lysosomal structures and apoptosis. The findings of this study help to increase the understanding of chemical stress responses in the developing zebrafish embryo and provide a starting point to improve experimental designs for this model system. In future, improved time- and concentration-resolved experiments should offer better understanding of stress response patterns and access to mechanistic information. © The Author 2017.

TI  - Toxicity testing of pesticides in zebrafish—a systematic review on chemicals and associated toxicological endpoints
AB  - The use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) has arisen as a promising biological platform for toxicity testing of pesticides such as herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. Therefore, it is relevant to assess the use of zebrafish in models of exposure to investigate the diversity of pesticide-associated toxicity endpoints which have been reported. Thus, this review aimed to assess the recent literature on the use of zebrafish in pesticide toxicity studies to capture data on the types of pesticide used, classes of pesticides, and zebrafish life stages associated with toxicity endpoints and phenotypic observations. A total of 352 articles published between September 2012 and May 2019 were curated. The results show an increased trend in the use of zebrafish for testing the toxicity of pesticides, with a great diversity of pesticides (203) and chemical classes (58) with different applications (41) being used. Furthermore, experimental outcomes could be clustered in 13 toxicity endpoints, mainly developmental toxicity, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. Organophosphorus, pyrethroid, azole, and triazine were the most studied classes of pesticides and associated with various toxicity endpoints. Studies frequently opted for early life stages (embryos and larvae). Although there is an evident lack of standardization of nomenclatures and phenotypic alterations, the information gathered here highlights associations between (classes of) pesticides and endpoints, which can be used to relate mechanisms of action specific to certain classes of chemicals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Distribution and fate of nonylphenol in an aquatic microcosm
AB  - An aquatic microcosm consisting of four compartments, namely surface microlayer (SM), water sediment and biota (zebra fish), was developed to investigate the distribution and fate of nonylphenol (NP) in an aquatic environment. Level III and level IV fugacity-based multimedia models were used to calculate the distribution and fate of NP. Data obtained from model calculations were in good agreement with those of the experiments. Results of the model calculations showed that 86.50% of all NP input was removed by advective outflow, while 61.99% of the remainder was distributed to the sediment phase, 34.89% to the water phase, 2.50×10-2% to SM and 3.13% to the biotic phase. This finding demonstrates that sediment plays a key role in the fate of NP and acts as a sink in the aquatic environment. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) of NP in the zebra fish was high and varied in different parts of the fish. The highest BCF was 1440 in the viscera. After the uptake experiment, depuration of NP in clean water indicated that, the concentration of residue NP in the zebra fish was still high. This implies that NP in fish can pose a potential threat to human health due to its bioaccumulation in the food chain. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bioaccumulation and molecular effects of sediment-bound metals in zebrafish embryos
AB  - Predicting the bioavailability and effects of metals in sediments is of major concern in context with sediment risk assessment. This study aimed to investigate the bioavailability and molecular effects of metals spiked into riverine sediments to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Embryos were exposed to a natural and an artificial sediment spiked with cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) individually or as a mixture at concentrations ranging from 150 to 3000 mg/kg dry weight (dw) over 48 h, and uptake of metals was determined. Furthermore, transcript abundances of the metallothioneins MT1 and MT2, the metal-responsive element-binding transcription factor (MTF) and the genes sod1, hsp70 and hsp90α1 were measured as indicators of metal-induced or general cellular stress. D. rerio embryos accumulated metals from sediments at concentrations up to 100 times greater than those spiked to the sediment with the greatest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) for Cu from artificial sediment (275.4 ± 41.9 (SD)). Embryos accumulated greater concentrations of all metals from artificial than from natural sediment, and accumulation was greater when embryos were exposed to individual metals than when they were exposed to the mixture. Exposure of embryos to Zn or the mixture exhibited up to 30-fold greater transcript abundances of MT1, MT2 and hsp70 compared to controls which is related to significant uptake of Zn from the sediment. Further changes in transcript abundances could not be related to a significant uptake of metals from sediments. These studies reveal that metals from spiked sediments are bioavailable to D. rerio embryos directly exposed to sediments and that the induction of specific genes can be used as biomarkers for the exposure of early life stages of zebrafish to metal-contaminated sediments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Investigations on sediment toxicity of German rivers applying a standardized bioassay battery
AB  - River sediments may contain a huge variety of environmental contaminants and play a key role in the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Contaminants adsorbed to sediments and suspended solids may contribute directly or after remobilization to an adverse ecological and chemical status of surface water. In this subproject of the joint research project DanTox, acetonic Soxhlet extracts from three German river sediments from the River Rhine (Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein with moderate contamination) and River Elbe (Veringkanal Hamburg heavily contaminated) were prepared and redissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These extracts were analyzed with a standard bioassay battery with organisms from different trophic levels (bacteria, algae, Daphnia, fish) as well as in the Ames test and the umuC test for bacterial mutagenicity and genotoxicity according to the respective OECD and ISO guidelines. In total, 0.01 % (standard) up to 0.25 % (only fish embryo test) of the DMSO sediment extract was dosed to the test systems resulting in maximum sediment equivalent concentrations (SEQ) of 2 up to 50 g l−1. The sediment of Veringkanal near Hamburg harbor was significantly more toxic in most tests compared to the sediment extracts from Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein from the River Rhine. The most toxic effect found for Veringkanal was in the algae test with an ErC50 (72 h) of 0.00226 g l−1 SEQ. Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples were about factor 1,000 less toxic. In the Daphnia, Lemna, and acute fish toxicity tests, no toxicity at all was found at 2 g l−1 SEQ. corresponding to 0.01 % DMSO. Only when increasing the DMSO concentration the fish embryo test showed a 22-fold higher toxicity for Veringkanal than for Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples, while the toxicity difference was less evident for the Daphnia test due to the overlaying solvent toxicity above 0.05 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The higher toxicities observed with the Veringkanal sample are supported by the PAH and PCB concentrations analyzed in the sediments. The sediment extracts of Altrip and Veringkanal were mutagenic in the Ames tester strain TA98 with metabolic activation (S9-mix). The findings allow a better ecotoxicological characterization of the sediments extensively analyzed in all subprojects of the DanTox project (e.g., Garcia-Kaeufer et al. Environ Sci Pollut Res. doi:10.1007/s11356-014-3894-4, 2014; Schiwy et al. Environ Sci Pollut Res. doi:10.1007/s11356-014-3185-0, 2014; Hollert and Keiter 2015). In the absence of agreed limit values for sediment extracts in standard tests, further data with unpolluted reference sediments are required for a quantitative risk assessment of the investigated polluted sediments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - The importance of sediments in ecological quality assessment of stream headwaters: embryotoxicity along the Nidda River and its tributaries in Central Hesse, Germany
AB  - Background: Although the crucial importance of sediments in aquatic systems is well-known, sediments are often neglected as a factor in the evaluation of water quality assessment. To support and extend previous work in that field, this study was conducted to assess the impact of surface water and sediment on fish embryos in the case of a highly anthropogenically influenced river catchment in Central Hesse, Germany. Results: The results of 96 h post fertilisation fish embryo toxicity test with Danio rerio (according to OECD Guideline 236) revealed that river samples comprising both water and sediment exert pivotal effects in embryos, whereas surface water alone did not. The most prominent reactions were developmental delays and, to some extent, malformations of embryos. Developmental delays occurred at rates up to 100% in single runs. Malformation rates ranged mainly below 10% and never exceeded 25%. Conclusion: A clear relationship between anthropogenic point sources and detected effects could not be established. However, the study illustrates the critical condition of the entire river system with respect to embryotoxic potentials present even at the most upstream test sites. In addition, the study stresses the necessity to take into account sediments for the evaluation of ecosystem health in industrialised areas. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Assessment of sediment quality of Yangtze river estuary using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - Yangtze River estuary is one of the largest estuaries worldwide. In this study, the sediment quality of Yangtze River estuary was evaluated using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Freshly fertilized zebrafish eggs (2 h after fertilization) were exposed to the whole sediment and its organic phase of extract, respectively. The parameters, including survival rate, abnormality, hatching rate, and heart rate of the zebrafish embryos, were recorded during the 96-h exposure. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni, Cr, and As) and low-molecular weight PAHs (Fluorene) in the sediment of Yangtze River estuary exceeded their corresponding effects range low values. The maximum concentrations of Zn and Fluorene in the sediment samples were 239.6 lg/g and 45.9 ng/g, respectively. In both whole sediment test and organic extract test, the survival rate and heart rate of zebrafish embryos were reduced, as well as abnormalities and delayed hatching were induced. For example, the highest mortality of the embryos was 39% in the whole sediment exposure. Overall, the occurrence of toxic compounds in the sediment of Yangtze River estuary may have potentially teratogenic effect on biota. The sediment from the upstream of Yangtze River estuary have more observed toxic effects on zebrafish embryos than that form the downstream. Therefore, more attention should be paid to control these pollutants, especially heavy metals in the Yangtze River estuary. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Differences in biomarker and behavioral responses to native and chemically dispersed crude and refined fossil oils in zebrafish early life stages
AB  - Petroleum products including crude oils and refined distillates are unique environmental pollutants consisting of thousands of compounds with varying physical-chemical properties and resulting toxicity for aquatic biota. Hence, for a reliable risk assessment individual petroleum product toxicity profiles are needed. Furthermore, the influence of oil spill response strategies like the application of chemical dispersants has to be implemented. The present study addressed the toxicity of water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of two different oil types on fish early life stages on different biological organization levels in the laboratory model species Danio rerio. Experiments with a 3rd generation dispersant used in loading rated resembling the exposure in experiments with chemically dispersed oils were included, enabling a direct comparability of results. This approach is of high importance as especially the investigation of dispersant toxicity in relevant exposure concentrations is rather scarce. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different WAFs shortly after and up to 120 hour post fertilization (hpf). Besides phenotypic effects including edema and spine deformations, reduced responses to dark stimuli, increased CYP1A activity and marginal AChE inhibition were observed in sublethal effect concentrations. Both oil types had varying strength of toxicity, which did not correlate with corresponding chemical analysis of target PAHs. Chemically dispersed oils induced stronger acute toxicity in zebrafish embryos compared to native (initial) oil exposure, which was further reflected by very low exposure concentrations for biomarker endpoints. Based on a comparison to the dispersant alone, a higher toxicity of dispersed oils was related to a combination of dispersant toxicity and an elevated crude oil compound bioavailability, due to dispersion-related partitioning kinetics. In contrast to LEWAF and CEWAF neither typical morphological effects nor mechanism-specific toxicity were observed for the dispersant alone, indicating narcosis as the responsible cause of effects. © 2019

There is significant conservation of genetics and other cellular networks among zebrafish and other vertebrate models, including humans. Here we discuss the recent work and efforts made in different fields of biology to explore the potential of zebrafish. Along with this, we also reviewed the concept of systems biology. A biological system is made up of a large number of components that interact in a huge variety of combinations. To understand completely the behavior of a system, it is important to know its components and interactions, and this can be achieved through a systems biology approach.

TI  - Zinc and cadmium accumulation in single zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos - A total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry application
AB  - Trace metals such as Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) are known to exhibit adverse effects on many aquatic organisms including early life stages of fish. In contact with contaminated sediment, fish eggs and embryos may be exposed to metals via the water phase as well as via direct contact with contaminated particles. This may result in body burdens that are difficult to predict and may vary according to individual micro scale exposure conditions. The highly sensitive total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) may provide a tool to analyse individual embryos for internal contaminant concentrations and thus helps to develop a better understanding of dose-response relationships. To test this hypothesis, embryos of Danio rerio were exposed to Cd and Zn spiked sediment in different treatments applying an ion exchange resin for modification of bioavailable concentrations. The TXRF analysis indicated individual embryos with dramatically enhanced exposure compared to other individuals despite uniform exposure conditions on a macro scale. Ion exchanger reduced embryo Zn concentrations to values close to control value with a comparably low standard deviation. Cadmium concentrations in embryos were in the range of 4000 to 7000 μg/g with a median of 5740 μg/g. A commercial ion exchanger reduced individual body burdens by a factor 50 to 100. Individual peak body burdens of up to 3160 μg/g were accompanied by reduced weight of the fish eggs due to early death i.e. coagulation. The investigation of exposure and effects on an individual-based scale may significantly help to reduce uncertainty and inconsistencies occurring in conventional analysis of pooled fish embryo samples. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Embryotoxic and proteotoxic effects of water and sediment from the neckar river (southern germany) to zebrafish (danio rerio) embryos
AB  - Background: The Neckar River (Southern Germany) represents an aquatic system strongly affected by numerous anthropogenic activities. Thus, it is an excellent model for ecotoxicological investigations. The present study aims to assess time and spatial variations of embryo- and proteotoxic effects in surface water and sediment. For this end, embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to Neckar River samples collected in the Tübingen region in different seasons over 2 years. Additionally, quantification of the heat shock (stress) protein Hsp70 was carried out in newly hatched larvae; furthermore, physico-chemical water parameters were measured in order to gain baseline information about the limnologic conditions. Results: Nearly all of the investigated Neckar River sites caused elevated mortality, developmental retardation and failures, modified heart rate and reduced hatching success in zebrafish embryos and larvae. Additionally, exposure to Neckar River water and sediment led to changes in larval Hsp70 level. During the 2 years of investigation, seasonal differences of embryo- and proteotoxic effects occurred. Along these lines, physico-chemical measurements delivered basic information for the interpretation of in vivo test data. Conclusions: Our study suggests a changing toxic burden in the whole investigated study area. Consequently, for ecotoxicological field studies, time and spatial variations on small scale must be dealt with. The lethal and sublethal endpoints of the fish embryo test combined with Hsp70 level measurements proved to be effective tools for toxicity assessment of environmental samples. © 2014 Vincze et al.

TI  - Evaluation of the hazard potentials of river suspended particulate matter and floodplain soils in the Rhine basin using chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess the hazard potentials of contaminated suspended particulate matter (SPM) sampled during a flood event for floodplain soils using in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis. Sediment-contact tests were performed to evaluate the direct exposure of organisms to native soils and SPM at two different trophic levels. For comparison, acetonic extracts were tested using both contact tests and additionally two cell-based biotests for cytotoxicity and Ah receptor-mediated activity (EROD-Assay). The sediment-contact tests were carried out with the dehydrogenase assay with Arthrobacter globiformis and the fish embryo assay with Danio rerio. The results of this study clearly document that native samples may well be significantly more effective than corresponding extracts in the bacteria contact assay or the fish embryo test. These results question the commonly accepted concept that acetonic extracts are likely to overestimate the toxicity of soil and SPM samples. Likewise, the priority organic compounds analyzed failed to fully explain the toxic potential of the samples. The outcomes of this study revealed the insufficient knowledge regarding the relationship between the different exposure pathways. Finally, there is concern about adverse effects by settling suspended particulate matter and remobilized sediments in frequently inundated floodplain soils due to an increase of the hazard potential, if compared with infrequently inundated floodplain soils. We showed that the settling of SPM and sediments revealed a significant impact on the dioxin-like potencies of riparian soils. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Ecotoxicological assessment of effluents from Brazilian wastewater treatment plants using zebrafish embryotoxicity test: A multi-biomarker approach
AB  - Effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) remains one of the major pollutants of aquatic environments; however, knowledge about its ecotoxic effects at fish early life stages is limited. The ecotoxicity of effluent from Brazilian WWTPs was herein analyzed based on responses of multiple biomarkers in the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET). Ecotoxicity was analyzed based on mortality rate, hatching rate, spontaneous movement rate (neurotoxicity), heart rate (cardiotoxicity), frequency of morphological changes and morphometric parameters during 144 h exposure time. Results showed that embryos exposed to affluent and effluent presented high mortality rate and delayed hatching rate, as well as changes in morphometric parameters. Exposed embryos also showed physiological, sensory, skeletal and muscular changes, which confirms that the ecotoxic effect of WWTPs effluent is systemic and associated with the presence of several pollutants, even at low concentrations (mixture toxicity). The present study is pioneer in using responses of multiple biomarkers in ZET as suitable approach to assess the ecotoxicity of WWTPs effluent in developing countries, as well as to add value and contribute to studies on WWTPs worldwide. Zebrafish is a suitable vertebrate model to assess the ecotoxicity of WWTP effluent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rapid well-plate assays for motor and social behaviors in larval zebrafish
AB  - Behavior phenotypes are a powerful means of uncovering subtle xenobiotic chemical impacts on vertebrate nervous system development. Rodents manifest complex and informative behavior phenotypes but are generally not practical models in which to screen large numbers of chemicals. Zebrafish recapitulate much of the behavioral complexity of higher vertebrates, develop externally and are amenable to assay automation. Short duration automated assays can be leveraged to screen large numbers of chemicals or comprehensive dose-response for fewer chemicals. Here we describe a series of mostly automated assays including larval photomotor response, strobe light response, blue color avoidance, shoaling and mirror stimulus-response performed on the ZebraBox (ViewPoint Behavior Technologies) instrument platform. To explore the sensitivity and uniqueness of each assay endpoint, larval cohorts from 5 to 28 days post fertilization were acutely exposed to several chemicals broadly understood to impact different neuro-activities. We highlight the throughput advantages of using the same instrument platform for multiple assays and the ability of different assays to detect unique phenotypes among different chemicals. © 2020

TI  - Comparative live-imaging of in vivo EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) induction in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos after exposure to PAHs and river sediment extracts
AB  - The measurement of EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) activity to determine the induction of CYP1A after exposure to dioxin-like substances is a well-established biomarker in fish. For reasons of animal welfare and implementations of new chemicals regulations (REACh), in vivo methods using zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos have recently been developed to quantify CYP1A induction, which is visualized as mean intensity of the autofluorescent resorufin formed in living anaesthetized embryos. In the present study, concentration ranges of three PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene, β-naphthoflavone, benzo[k]fluoranthene) as examples of known CYP1A inducers as well as extracts of two well-characterized sediment samples of the lower Neckar river (Southern Germany) were used to determine the suitability of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryo for the in vivo EROD assay. Data for zebrafish embryos were generated for comparison. Fathead minnow embryos were principally suitable to show in vivo EROD induction via live-imaging. Since in fathead minnow embryos both signal area and fluorescence intensities are lower than in zebrafish embryos, the induction potentials of the three model PAHs and the environmental samples proved to be species-dependent. Among the three PAHs tested, benzo[k]fluoranthene lead to the strongest EROD signal followed by β-naphthoflavone and benzo[a]pyrene in comparison to the positive control. Whereas benzo[k]fluoranthene and β-naphthoflavone showed a dose-response relationship for the EROD induction, benzo[a]pyrene failed to induce a significant signal in fathead minnow embryos. If compared to the model PAHs, the extracts of both sediments from the lower Neckar River induced stronger EROD signals in both fathead minnow and zebrafish embryos. Observations thus documented fathead minnow embryos to be as suitable for biomonitoring purposes as are zebrafish embryos. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Genotoxic and teratogenic effect of freshwater sediment samples from the Rhine and Elbe River (Germany) in zebrafish embryo using a multi-endpoint testing strategy
AB  - The embryotoxic potential of three model sediment samples with a distinct and well-characterized pollutant burden from the main German river basins Rhine and Elbe was investigated. The Fish Embryo Contact Test (FECT) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) was applied and submitted to further development to allow for a comprehensive risk assessment of such complex environmental samples. As particulate pollutants are constructive constituents of sediments, they underlay episodic source-sink dynamics, becoming available to benthic organisms. As bioavailability of xenobiotics is a crucial factor for ecotoxicological hazard, we focused on the direct particle-exposure pathway, evaluating throughput-capable endpoints and considering toxicokinetics. Fish embryo and larvae were exposed toward reconstituted (freeze-dried) sediment samples on a microcosm-scale experimental approach. A range of different developmental embryonic stages were considered to gain knowledge of potential correlations with metabolic competence during the early embryogenesis. Morphological, physiological, and molecular endpoints were investigated to elucidate induced adverse effects, placing particular emphasis on genomic instability, assessed by the in vivo comet assay. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the extent of induced cell death, since cytotoxicity can lead to confounding effects. The implementation of relative toxicity indices further provides inter-comparability between samples and related studies. All of the investigated sediments represent a significant ecotoxicological hazard by disrupting embryogenesis in zebrafish. Beside the induction of acute toxicity, morphological and physiological embryotoxic effects could be identified in a concentration-response manner. Increased DNA strand break frequency was detected after sediment contact in characteristic non-monotonic dose–response behavior due to overlapping cytotoxic effects. The embryonic zebrafish toxicity model along with the in vivo comet assay and molecular biomarker analysis should prospectively be considered to assess the ecotoxicological potential of sediments allowing for a comprehensive hazard ranking. In order to elucidate mode of action, novel techniques such as flow cytometry have been adopted and proved to be valuable tools for advanced risk assessment and management. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Use of biological detection methods to assess dioxin-like compounds in sediments of Bohai Bay, China
AB  - Bohai Bay, in the western region of northeastern China's Bohai Sea, receives water from large rivers containing various pollutants including dioxin-like compounds (DLCs). This study used the established zebrafish (Danio rerio) model, its known developmental toxicity endpoints and sensitive molecular analyses to evaluate sediments near and around an industrial effluent site in Bohai Bay. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of rapid biological detection methods as an addition to chemical analyses. Embryos were exposed to various concentrations of sediment extracts as well as a 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) positive control. Exposure to sediment extract nearest the discharge site (P1) resulted in the most severe- and highest rates of change in embryos and larvae, suggesting that DLC contaminated sediment probably did not occur much beyond it. P1 extract resulted in concentration dependent increases in mortality and pericardial edema. Its highest concentration caused up-regulation of P-450 (CYP)-1A1(CYP1A) mRNA expression at 72 h post fertilization (hpf), an increase in its expression in gill arches as observed by whole mount in situ hybridization, and an increased signal in the Tg(cyp1a: mCherry) transgenic line. The pattern and magnitude of response was very similar to that of TCDD and supported the presence of DLCs in these sediment samples. Follow-up chemical analysis confirmed this presence and identified H7CDF, O8CDF and O8CDD as the main components in P1 extract. This study validates the use of biological assays as a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method to evaluate DLCs and their effects in sediment samples. Additionally, it provides support for the conclusion that DLCs have limited remobilization capacity in marine sediments. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Embryo/larval toxicity and transcriptional effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to endocrine active riverbed sediments
AB  - Sediment toxicity plays a fundamental role in the health of inland fish communities; however, the assessment of the hazard potential of contaminated sediments is not a common objective in environmental diagnostics or remediation. This study examined the potential of transcriptional endpoints investigated in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to riverbed sediments in ecotoxicity testing. Embryo-larval 10-day tests were conducted on sediment samples collected from five sites (one upstream and four downstream of the city of Milan) along a polluted tributary of the Po River, the Lambro River. Sediment chemistry showed a progressive downstream deterioration in river quality, so that the final sampling site showed up to eight times higher concentrations of, for example, triclosan, galaxolide, PAH, PCB, BPA, Ni, and Pb, compared with the uppermost site. The embryo/larval tests showed widespread toxicity although the middle river sections evidenced worse effects, as evidenced by delayed embryo development, hatching rate, larval survival, and growth. At the mRNA transcript level, the genes encoding biotransformation enzymes (cyp1a, gst, ugt) showed increasing upregulations after exposure to sediment from further downstream sites. The genes involved in antioxidant responses (sod, gpx) suggested that more critical conditions may be present at downstream sites, but even upstream of Milan there seemed to be some level of oxidative stress. Indirect evidences of potential apoptotic activity (bcl2/bax < 1) in turn suggested the possibility of genotoxic effects. The genes encoding for estrogen receptors (erα, erβ1, erβ2) showed exposure to (xeno)estrogens with a progressive increase after exposure to sediments from downstream sites, paralleled by a corresponding downregulation of the ar gene, likely related to antiandrogenic compounds. Multiple levels of thyroid disruption were also evident particularly in downstream zebrafish, as for thyroid growth (nkx2.1), hormone synthesis and transport (tg, ttr, d2), and signal transduction (trα, trβ). The inhibition of the igf2 gene reasonably reflected larval growth inhibitions. Although none of the sediment chemicals could singly explain fish responses, principal component analysis suggested a good correlation between gene transcripts and the overall trend of contamination. Thus, the combined impacts from known and unknown covarying chemicals were proposed as the most probable explanation of fish responses. In summary, transcriptional endpoints applied to zebrafish embryo/larval test can provide sensitive, comprehensive, and timeliness information which may greatly enable the assessment of the hazard potential of sediments to fish, complementing morphological endpoints and being potentially predictive of longer studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - State of the art and advances in the impact assessment of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds
AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic and persistent organic pollutants that are able to enter the food chain, accumulate in the fat tissues of animals, and consequently pose a serious risk for human health. Consolidated tools for exposure assessment have been implemented during the last decades and widely used, both in the environmental monitoring and in modeling activities. Although the emissive trend and the concentrations in the environment have gradually decreased during the last 20 years, some situations are still underrated and not adequately controlled by the environmental legislation. On the other hand, a complete monitoring of all the pathways of exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs is technically and economically unfeasible. Therefore, this paper aims at providing an overview of the traditional approaches used to assess the impacts of PCDD/Fs and PCBs and presenting the novelties introduced during the last years. After an initial characterization of their toxicity and their effects on health, this paper focuses on activities and situations that can result in critical releases of PCDD/Fs and PCBs into the atmosphere and that can represent a hidden threat for the population. In the final part, this study presents the current methodologies for exposure assessment, summarizes the food chain models in a unified way, and puts the light on new methods that can help environmental scientists, risk assessors, and decision makers to estimate the risk related to exposure to PCDD/Fs in different contexts. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Sex steroids in the female zebrafish (Danio rerio). Effects of cyproterone acetate and leachate-contaminated sediment extract
AB  - In Molnbyggen, a leachate-contaminated lake in Sweden, effects on the reproductive system of perch included a decreased frequency of sexually mature female perch, reduced gonadosomatic index and decreased plasma levels of androstenedione and testosterone, but the contaminants responsible for these effects have not yet been identified. A biomarker-directed fractionation approach could be used to narrow the search for the compound(s) responsible for the adverse effects in Molnbyggen female perch. Thus, it is important to develop and test a suitable biomarker, which can be used in this type of approach. We evaluated if decreased concentrations of sex steroids could work as an in vivo end-point in female zebrafish fed an organic extract of bottom sediments from Molnbyggen. The responsiveness of zebrafish to endocrine alteration was evaluated using a positive control substance, cyproterone acetate (CA), which is known to inhibit steroid biosynthesis. After the 21-day exposure period the concentrations of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) were successfully determined by HRGC/HRMS in whole-body homogenates of individual fish. Median T concentrations were 1.7 pmol/g fish in controls and were decreased after exposure both to CA (0.55 pmol/g fish) and Molnbyggen sediment extract (1.2-1.3 pmol/g fish). Median E2 concentrations were 5.3 pmol/g fish in controls and were decreased after CA exposure (2.3 pmol/g fish) and after exposure to Molnbyggen sediment extract (4.0-4.5 pmol/g fish). This suggests that sex steroid concentrations in zebrafish are responsive to endocrine alteration and indicates that compounds with endocrine altering potency are present in Molnbyggen sediments. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) using as model for genotoxicity and DNA repair assessments: Historical review, current status and trends
AB  - Genotoxic pollutants lead to both DNA damage and changes in cell repair mechanisms. Selecting suitable biomonitors is a fundamental step in genotoxicity studies. Thus, zebrafish have become a popular model used to assess the genotoxicity of different pollutants in recent years. They have orthologous genes with humans and hold almost all genes involved in different repair pathways. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to summarize the existing literature on zebrafish using as model system to assess the genotoxicity of different pollutants. Revised data have shown that comet assay is the main technique adopted in these studies. However, it is necessary standardizing the technique applied to zebrafish in order to enable better result interpretation and comparisons. Overall, pollutants lead to single-strand breaks (SSB), double-strand breaks (DSB), adduct formation, as well as to changes in the expression of genes involved in repair mechanisms. Although analyzing repair mechanisms is essential to better understand the genotoxic effects caused by pollutants, few studies have analyzed repair capacity. The current review reinforces the need of conducting further studies on the role played by repair pathways in zebrafish subjected to DNA damage. Revised data have shown that zebrafish are a suitable model to assess pollutant-induced genotoxicity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Zebrafish as an Emerging Model System in the Global South: Two Decades of Research in Brazil
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emerging model system in several research areas worldwide, especially in the Global South. In this context, the present study revised the historical use and trends of zebrafish as experimental models in Brazil. The data concerning the bibliometric parameters, research areas, geographic distribution, experimental design, zebrafish strain, and reporter lines, as well as recent advances were revised. In addition, the comparative trends of Brazilian and global research were discussed. Revised data showed the rapid growth of Brazilian scientific production using zebrafish as a model, especially in three main research areas (Neuroscience &and Behavior, Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Environment/Ecology). Studies were conducted in 19 Brazilian states (70.37%), confirming the wide geographic distribution and importance of zebrafish research. Results indicated that research related to toxicological approaches are widespread in Global South countries such as Brazil. Studies were performed mainly using in vivo tests (89.58%) with adult fish (59.75%) and embryos (30.67%). Moreover, significant research gaps and recommendations for future research are presented. The present study shows that the zebrafish is a suitable vertebrate model system in the Global South. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Immunotoxicological effects of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls extracted from Zhanjiang Bay sediments in zebrafish
AB  - Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants spread all over the world. They can cause disorders in the reproductive, nervous, gut, and immune systems. We investigated the effects of DL-PCB extracted from Zhanjiang (Guangdong Province, China) offshore area on the immune functions of adult zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to different levels of DL-PCBs, i.e., control, positive control (PCB77 at 16.0 μg/L), low (LD; PCB81 + PCB118 at 0.32 μg/L), and high-dose (HD; PCB81 + PCB118 at 16.0 μg/L) groups for 28 days. Compared with the control group, positive control and HD group showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the number of red blood cells (RBC) on day 7 and the same decrease was observed in the LD group (P < 0.05) on day 21. The results of white blood cell (WBC) profiles were opposite to that of RBCs. Moreover, the serum lysozyme activity was significantly lower in positive control and HD group (P < 0.05) on day 21 but no significant effect was observed in the LD group. The mucus lysozyme activity and immunoglobulin concentration in positive control and HD group decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from day 14. A similar effect was observed in the LD group but was significant (P < 0.05) only on day 28. Additionally, histopathological examination showed accumulation of hemosiderin in the spleen of experimental animals, which was significant in positive control and HD group. Further, renal tubular epithelial cells of head kidney were swollen in the positive control and HD group while the expansion of lumen and renal interstitial edema was observed in the LD group on day 21 and with significant presence on 28 days. Therefore, these findings suggest that the exposure of zebrafish to DL-PCBs at > 16.0 μg/L can impair their immune functions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Assessment of environmentally contaminated sediment using a contact assay with early life stage zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Lake Saint-Louis, a shallow fluvial lake near the western tip of the island of Montreal, QC, Canada is an important spawning ground for many species of fish. Sediments in certain areas of the lake are known to be contaminated with high levels of metals and legacy organic chemicals. To improve our understanding of risk to native fish populations, we conducted a study evaluating levels of sediment contamination and potential effects on early life stage fish. Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs were several orders of magnitude higher at two industrial sites (B1 and B2) than at a nearby reference site (IP). Concentrations of 32 metals and metalloids were at least 5-fold higher at B1 and B2 than at IP. Moreover, all available interim sediment quality guidelines (ISQGs) were exceeded at the two contaminated sites, while none were exceeded at the reference site. Biological effects were evaluated using a sediment contact assay. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to clean water (control), or to sediment from IP, B1, and B2 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Mortality was significantly elevated in fish exposed to the B1, but not the B2 sediment. The frequency of deformities increased with increasing contamination, but this trend was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Genes that are implicated in the response to PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and furans (cyp1a, cyp1b1, ahr2) were significantly elevated in the 120 hpf larvae exposed to the B1 and B2 sediments. Global DNA methylation, and mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress (maft, cat, hmox1, sod2), embryonic development (bmp2b, baf60c), metal exposure (mt2), and DNA repair (gadd45b) were unaffected. Our results suggest that the Beauharnois sector of Lake Saint-Louis is poor quality spawning habitat due to high levels of contamination, and the potential for harmful effects on early life stage fish. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hazard assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water and sediment in the vicinity of coalmines
AB  - Purpose: Rivers feeding into the Loskop Dam, South Africa, pass through coal mining and heavily industrialised areas. Previous studies investigating mass mortalities of crocodile and fish in the river system, revealed the presence of organic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in their tissues. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from nine sites within the dam in winter and summer. Liquid-liquid and microwave-assisted extraction was used for preconcentrating PAHs from water and sediment samples, respectively. Extracts were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode to determine the presence and levels of the 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)-priority PAHs. Results and discussion: Significant levels of PAHs were found in both water and sediment samples. Concentrations were higher in sediments than in water, as well as in samples collected in winter. Levels of PAHs in sediments were generally higher than those reported by many researchers for other water bodies in industrialised areas. Zebrafish embryos were used to assess potential risks associated with the water and sediment, and to determine the effects of PAHs on aquatic life. Embryos, exposed to intact water and sediment samples, as well as to diluted sediment extracts, were monitored for 120 h post fertilisation. Sediment proved more toxic to zebrafish embryos than water, causing delayed embryo development and malformations. Conclusions: These findings are alarming as they indicate that this water system is under stress. These findings can be typical of any water system situated in a coal mining and industrial region. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Embryotoxicity and genotoxicity evaluation of sediments from Yangtze River estuary using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - Sediments function both as a sink and a source of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems and may impose serious effects on benthic organisms and human health. As one of the largest estuaries in the world, the Yangtze River estuary suffers from abundant wastewater from the coastal cities. In this study, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were employed in the fish embryo test and a comet assay to evaluate the embryotoxicity and genotoxicity of the sediments from the Yangtze River estuary, respectively. Results showed that the sediments from the Yangtze River estuary significantly increased mortality, induced development abnormalities, and reduced hatching rate and heart rate of zebrafish embryos after 96 h of exposure. Significant genotoxicity was observed in the samples relative to the controls. Relatively low-level embryotoxicity and genotoxicity of sediments were found in the Yangtze River compared with other river systems. Toxic responses were also discussed in relation to the analyzed organic contaminants in sediments. More attention should be paid to non-priority pollutant monitoring in the Yangtze River estuary. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Toxicity of sediment cores from Yangtze River estuary to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AB  - Toxicity evaluation is an important segment in sediment quality monitoring in order to protect aquatic organisms and human health. The purpose of this study is to assess the toxicity of sediments from three sediment cores in Yangtze River Estuary, China, using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo tests. Fertilized zebrafish eggs were exposed to both whole sediments and sediment organic extracts prepared from collected sediments, in order to provide a comprehensive and realistic insight into the bioavailable toxicity potential of the sediments. As end points, development parameters (mortality, hatching rate, and abnormality) in the developing embryos were recorded during the 96-h exposure. The results showed that some samples increased mortality, inhibited the hatching of embryos, and induced morphological abnormalities. The embryonic toxicities presented serrated changes and irregular distribution with depth, which may be related to hydrodynamic effect and unstable environmental input. However, lethal and sub-lethal effects were more significant at the sub-surface sediments (10∼40 cm), which indicated that the pollution is more serious in recent decades. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Dietary exposure to non-dioxin-like PCBs of the Hong Kong adult population from a total diet study
AB  - Dietary exposure of Hong Kong adults to the sum of the six indicator PCBs (Σ6 PCBs; PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, and 180) was estimated in this study using the Total Diet Study (TDS) approach. Seventy one commonly-consumed food items of animal origin were sampled in four seasons and prepared as consumed in 2010–2011. The results showed that the main dietary source of Σ6 PCBs to the adult population was ‘fish, seafood and their products’ which accounted for 84.3% of the total exposure. About 50% of the total exposure was contributed by four fish species: salmon (cooked salmon and salmon sashimi, 19.9%), mandarin fish (14.7%), pomfret fish (8.5%) and yellow croaker (7.5%). Salmon was found to contain the highest mean level of Σ6 PCBs of 5.7 ng g−1 fresh weight at upper bound estimation, ranging from 4.4 to 6.3 ng g−1. The lower bound and upper bound exposure estimates of Ʃ6 PCBs to the average consumer of the population were found to be 0.68 and 1.38 ng kg−1 body weight day−1 respectively while for high consumers, the lower bound and upper bound exposure estimates were 3.08 and 3.84 ng kg−1 body weight day−1 respectively. In addition, the dietary exposures to individual indicator PCB congeners were also estimated. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Histopathological changes in zebrafish embryos exposed to DLPCBs extract from Zhanjiang coastal sediment
AB  - Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs) are ubiquitous persistent pollutants that cause adverse effects in many environmental organisms. DLPCBs in marine sediments can be absorbed by benthic organisms, bioaccumulate, and biomagnify through the food chain and threaten animal and human health. There are no reports of DLPCBs concentrations in the Zhanjiang Gulf seabed. This study was designed to investigate the concentration of DLPCBs in the Zhanjiang coastal sediment and histopathological changes in zebrafish (Diano rerio) embryos exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of DLPCBs. Of the five sites selected, two sites TS and JSW contained DLPCBs at concentrations of 0.08 and 22.54 ng/g dry sediment, respectively. Two groups of zebrafish embryos were used. One group was exposed to 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 mg/ml of DLPCBs extracted from the sediments sampled from the TS site and the second group to 4.375, 8.75, 17.5, 35, and 70 mg/ml of DLPCBs from JSW site from 0.75 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf. The zebrafish exposed to 60 and 70 mg/ml of DLPCBs at 96 hpf displayed gross histopathological changes with cardiac lesions including pericardial edema being the most deleterious. Other changes observed were hydropic degeneration of gill filaments and hepatocytes, loss of intestinal folds, and uninflated swim bladder. It appears that only a few sites of the Zhanjiang gulf are contaminated with DLPCBs. This is the first report of histopathological changes in the gills, hepatocytes, intestines, heart, and the swim bladder in zebrafish embryos exposed to DLPCBs from a coastal sediment. Further studies with sampling at different stages of development are required to identify which organ/tissue is most sensitive to DLPCBs. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - How to Improve Toxicity Assessment? From Single-Species Tests to Mesocosms and Field Studies
AB  - The relationship between the concentration of a chemical substance in the medium and its effects on organisms must be quantified as well as possible because it is at the basis of the determination of the predicted no effect concentration that is a key parameter for environmental risk assessment. Thus, designing the procedures aiming at the determination of toxicological parameters must mobilize the most recent scientific knowledge. The present chapter provides a literature review allowing advances in biotesting practices, considering both the improvement of exposure scenarios (increasing the realism of the doses tested and of the ways of exposure), and the choice of more sensitive endpoints (growth, reproduction, behavior, and also subindividual effects linked to the success of reproduction). The quality of bioassays lies also on the relevant choice of biological models (Chapter 10) and the use of the best available statistic treatments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of fish DNA biomarkers as a molecular-level approach for ecological health assessments in an Urban Stream
AB  - This study was performed to determine the ecosystem health of an urban stream using DNA damage biomarkers of sentinel fish species along with chemical analyses of water and sediments in the impacted and reference zones. The results based on single-cell gel electrophoresis showed that the extent of DNA damage was significantly elevated in the polluted zone. The severity of DNA damage in the impacted zone was largely attributed to high levels of heavy metals, such as As, Zn, Pb, and Ni. The DNA damage biomarker in benthic fish was sensitive to habitat change, which suggested that this fish species and biomarker are excellent tools for risk assessment. The acute toxicity tests demonstrated that SCGE was sufficient to reflect the different genotypes and pollution statuses and to propose the possibility of zebrafish erythrocytes as competitive materials. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Effects of tubificid bioturbation on bioaccumulation of Cu and Zn released from sediment by aquatic organisms
AB  - To investigate the effects of bioturbation on absorption and enrichment of pollutants from sediments by aquatic organisms, microcosm systems similar to natural aquatic environment were established, and the release of Cu and Zn from the sediment, and their accumulation in some typical aquatic organisms, including submerged plants, floating plants and fish, with the presence of tubificids of different densities were measured. The results of this pilot study showed that the presence of tubificids promoted the migration of the trace metals from sediment to overlying water, especially when there were more worms and especially for Cu which is not easily released from the sediment. During the experiment, Cu in overlying water was mainly in particulate fraction. While for Zn, it was mainly in dissolved form in the early stage of the experiment, and then the dominant fraction gradually changed to particulate fraction. The bioturbation of tubificids also promoted the accumulation of both Cu and Zn in the aquatic organisms. In one system, different types of aquatic organisms showed different features for the accumulation of Cu and Zn. Meanwhile, with the presence of different intensity of bioturbation, the concentration of Cu or Zn in the same kind of organism was different. After a 30-day experiment, trace metal concentration in the aquatic organisms generally decreased in the order of floating plants (lesser duckweed) > submerged plants (Amazon sword) > small fish (zebrafish), and the concentration of Zn in the organisms was usually significantly higher than that of Cu in the same organism, especially in duckweed and zebrafish. However, the presence of tubificids and the density of them had more considerable effects on the uptake of Cu by the organisms, than on the uptake of Zn. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Omics in zebrafish teratogenesis
AB  - The genome revolution represents a complete change on our view of biological systems. The quantitative determination of changes in all major molecular components of the living cells, the “omics” approach, opened whole new fields for all health sciences. Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and others, together with appropriate prediction and modeling tools, will mark the future of developmental toxicity assessment both for wildlife and humans. This is especially true for disciplines, like teratology, which rely on studies in model organisms, as studies at lower levels of organization are difficult to implement. Rodents and frogs have been the favorite models for studying human reproductive and developmental disorders for decades. Recently, the study of the development of zebrafish embryos (ZE) is becoming a major alternative tool to adult animal testing. ZE intrinsic characteristics makes this model a unique system to analyze in vivo developmental alterations that only can be studied applying in toto approaches. Moreover, under actual legislations, ZE is considered as a replacement model (and therefore, excluded from animal welfare regulations) during the first 5 days after fertilization. Here we review the most important components of the zebrafish toolbox available for analyzing early stages of embryotoxic events that could eventually lead to teratogenesis. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Biomarkers of toxicity in zebrafish
AB  - Given that zebrafish have now become an accepted model for toxicological studies in both the human health and ecological communities, this chapter takes stock of the status of biomarkers of toxicity that have been proposed for the zebrafish model. Most of what is discussed here are biomarkers of effect, but the line between biomarkers of effect and exposure is often not well defined. Generally the chapter strives to present examples of many different types of biomarkers for many classes of toxicological "icities," but the chapter is not a comprehensive survey of all the zebrafish biomarker literature. Rather, it is a critical appraisal of the state of the effort to develop and identify biomarkers of toxicity in zebrafish. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Use of artificial sediment to assess toxicity of chromium on Chironomus xanthus, Danio rerio and Poecilia reticulata [Utilização de sedimento artificial na avaliação da toxicidade do cromo sobre Chironomus xanthus, Danio rerio e Poecilia reticulata]
AB  - Aim: Artificial sediments with simple formulations were used to assess the toxicity of Cr to C. xanthus, D. rerio and P. reticulata. Methods: The organisms were exposed to two sediment formulations: one without organic matter (S0) and one with 1% organic matter (SIII), both contaminated with Cr at concentrations of 90, 180, 360, 720 and 1440 mg/kg for the assays with C. xanthus, and 375, 750, 1500 and 3000 mg/kg for those with the two fish species. Chromium was obtained from the potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7). Results: The results of the acute toxicity tests demonstrated a reduction of up to four times in toxicity with the presence of OM, consisting of biodegradable detritus, even at the low concentration used (1%), and that C. xanthus was most sensitive to the metal. The reduction in the chromium toxicity was indicated by the LC50 values, which were higher in SIII (1234.43 mg/kg; 2263.54 m/kg; 2244.48 mg/kg) than in S0 (340.56 mg/kg; 1731.04 mg/kg; 1733.55 mg/kg) for C. xanthus, D. rerio and P. reticulata, respectively. Conclusions: Because of the repeatability of the results obtained, the artificial sediments with simple formulations were satisfactory to assess toxicity and can thus provide reliable results in ecotoxicological studies.

TI  - Effects of suspended dredged material on aquatic animals.
AB  - This report describes laboratory research designed to evaluate the impact of suspensions of relatively uncontaminated and contaminated harbour sediments on juvenile and adult marine, estuarine and freshwater fish and invertebrates. Studies of survival and tissue accumulation of contaminants were conducted for 21 days exposure to suspended sediments in a flow-through aquarium system. Even the most sensitive fish survived days of continuous exposure to suspensions of relatively uncontaminated sediment on the order of grams per litre, and the invertebrates generally survived similar exposures to tens of grams per litre of relatively uncontaminated sediment. Exposure to suspensions of contaminated sediment decreased survival substantially, but, even so, mortality occurred only after exposure to higher concentrations for longer time periods than are created in the water column by the typical dredging operation. Only fingerling striped bass Moronesaxatilis showed a sensitivity great enough to indicate a potential cause for concern from continuous pipeline discharge of highly contaminated dredged material. While water column impacts generally appeared to warrant little concern, the data indicate the potential for impact of contaminated fluid mud on benthic infauna and relatively immobile epifauna. Fluid muds with suspended sediment concentrations of tens of grams per litre can be created on the bottom by pipeline, and perhaps hopper, disposal of hydraulically dredged fine grained sediment. These can persist for sufficient periods to have a potential for impact on relatively immobile bottom dwellers, particularly if highly contaminated sediments are involved. Tissue uptake of contaminants from suspensions of highly contaminated sediment was limited. Of 100 species salinity contaminant combinations where uptake might have been measured, it actually occurred in less than one fourth of the cases. (A)

TI  - Dopamine receptors: From structure to function
AB  - The diverse physiological actions of dopamine are mediated by at least five district G protein-coupled receptor subtypes. Two D1-like receptor subtypes (D1 and D5) couple to the G protein G3 and activate adenylyl cyclase. The other receptor subtypes belong to the D2-like subfamily (D2, D3, D4) and are prototypic of G protein-coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate K+ channels. The genes for the D1 and D5 receptors are intronless, but pseudogenes of the D5 exist. The D2 and D3 receptors vary in certain tissues and species as a result of alternative splicing, and the human D4 receptor gene exhibits extensive polymorphic variation. In the central nervous system, dopamine receptors are widely expressed because they are involved in the control of locomotion, cognition, emotion, and affect as well as neuroendocrine secretion. In the periphery, dopamine receptors are present more prominently in kidney, vasculature, and pituitary, where they affect mainly sodium homeostasis, vascular tone, and hormone secretion. Numerous genetic linkage analysis studies have failed so far to reveal unequivocal evidence for the involvement of one of these receptors in the etiology of various central nervous system disorders. However, targeted deletion of several of these dopamine receptor genes in mice should provide valuable information about their physiological functions.

TI  - Phosphorus flame retardants: Properties, production, environmental occurrence, toxicity and analysis
AB  - Since the ban on some brominated flame retardants (BFRs), phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs), which were responsible for 20% of the flame retardant (FR) consumption in 2006 in Europe, are often proposed as alternatives for BFRs. PFRs can be divided in three main groups, inorganic, organic and halogen containing PFRs. Most of the PFRs have a mechanism of action in the solid phase of burning materials (char formation), but some may also be active in the gas phase. Some PFRs are reactive FRs, which means they are chemically bound to a polymer, whereas others are additive and mixed into the polymer. The focus of this report is limited to the PFRs mentioned in the literature as potential substitutes for BFRs. The physico-chemical properties, applications and production volumes of PFRs are given. Non-halogenated PFRs are often used as plasticisers as well. Limited information is available on the occurrence of PFRs in the environment. For triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), tricresylphosphate (TCP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(chloropropyl)phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), and tetrekis(2-chlorethyl)dichloroisopentyldiphosphate (V6) a number of studies have been performed on their occurrence in air, water and sediment, but limited data were found on their occurrence in biota. Concentrations found for these PFRs in air were up to 47μgm-3, in sediment levels up to 24mgkg-1 were found, and in surface water concentrations up to 379ngL-1. In all these matrices TCPP was dominant. Concentrations found in dust were up to 67mgkg-1, with TDCPP being the dominant PFR. PFR concentrations reported were often higher than polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) concentrations, and the human exposure due to PFR concentrations in indoor air appears to be higher than exposure due to PBDE concentrations in indoor air.Only the Cl-containing PFRs are carcinogenic. Other negative human health effects were found for Cl-containing PFRs as well as for TCP, which suggest that those PFRs would not be suitable alternatives for BFRs. TPhP, diphenylcresylphosphate (DCP) and TCP would not be suitable alternatives either, because they are considered to be toxic to (aquatic) organisms. Diethylphosphinic acid is, just like TCEP, considered to be very persistent. From an environmental perspective, resorcinol-bis(diphenylphosphate) (RDP), bisphenol-A diphenyl phosphate (BADP) and melamine polyphosphate, may be suitable good substitutes for BFRs.Information on PFR analysis in air, water and sediment is limited to TCEP, TCPP, TPhP, TCP and some other organophosphate esters. For air sampling passive samplers have been used as well as solid phase extraction (SPE) membranes, SPE cartridges, and solid phase micro-extraction (SPME).For extraction of PFRs from water SPE is recommended, because this method gives good recoveries (67-105%) and acceptable relative standard deviations (RSDs) (&lt;20%), and offers the option of on-line coupling with a detection system. For the extraction of PFRs from sediment microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is recommended. The recoveries (78-105%) and RSDs (3-8%) are good and the method is faster and requires less solvent compared to other methods.For the final instrumental analysis of PFRs, gas chromatography-flame photometric detection (GC-FPD), GC-nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD), GC-atomic emission detection (AED), GC-mass spectrometry (MS) as well as liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS and GC-Inductively-coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS) are used. GC-ICP-MS is a promising method, because it provides much less complex chromatograms while offering the same recoveries and limits of detection (LOD) (instrumental LOD is 5-10ngmL-1) compared to GC-NPD and GC-MS, which are frequently used methods for PFR analysis. GC-MS offers a higher selectivity than GC-NPD and the possibility of using isotopically labeled compounds for quantification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: Pharmacology and toxicology
AB  - Acetylcholinesterase is involved in the termination of impulse transmission by rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in numerous cholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The enzyme inactivation, induced by various inhibitors, leads to acetylcholine accumulation, hyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and disrupted neurotransmission. Hence, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, interacting with the enzyme as their primary target, are applied as relevant drugs and toxins. This review presents an overview of toxicology and pharmacology of reversible and irreversible acetylcholinesterase inactivating compounds. In the case of reversible inhibitors being commonly applied in neurodegenerative disorders treatment, special attention is paid to currently approved drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease, and toxic carbamates used as pesticides. Subsequently, mechanism of irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition induced by organophosphorus compounds (insecticides and nerve agents), and their specific and nonspecific toxic effects are described, as well as irreversible inhibitors having pharmacological implementation. In addition, the pharmacological treatment of intoxication caused by organophosphates is presented, with emphasis on oxime reactivators of the inhibited enzyme activity administering as causal drugs after the poisoning. Besides, organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides can be detoxified in mammals through enzymatic hydrolysis before they reach targets in the nervous system. Carboxylesterases most effectively decompose carbamates, whereas the most successful route of organophosphates detoxification is their degradation by corresponding phosphotriesterases. ©2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase — new roles for an old actor
AB  - The discovery of the first neurotransmitter — acetylcholine — was soon followed by the discovery of its hydrolysing enzyme, acetylcholinesterase. The role of acetylcholinesterase in terminating acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission made it the focus of intense research for much of the past century. But the complexity of acetylcholinesterase gene regulation and recent evidence for some of the long-suspected 'non-classical' actions of this enzyme have more recently driven a profound revolution in acetylcholinesterase research. Although our understanding of the additional roles of acetylcholinesterase is incomplete, the time is ripe to summarize the evidence on a remarkable diversity of acetylcholinesterase functions. © 2001, Macmillan Magazines Ltd.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
AB  - Acetylcholine, the first neurotransmitter to be identified, exerts many of its physiological actions via activation of a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Although the five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) share a high degree of sequence homology, they show pronounced differences in G-protein coupling preference and the physiological responses they mediate. Unfortunately, despite decades of effort, no therapeutic agents endowed with clear mAChR subtype selectivity have been developed to exploit these differences. We describe here the structure of the G q/11-coupled M3 mAChR ( M3 receptor', from rat) bound to the bronchodilator drug tiotropium and identify the binding mode for this clinically important drug. This structure, together with that of the G i/o-coupled M2 receptor, offers possibilities for the design of mAChR subtype-selective ligands. Importantly, the M3 receptor structure allows a structural comparison between two members of a mammalian GPCR subfamily displaying different G-protein coupling selectivities. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tiotropium binds transiently to an allosteric site en route to the binding pocket of both receptors. These simulations offer a structural view of an allosteric binding mode for an orthosteric GPCR ligand and provide additional opportunities for the design of ligands with different affinities or binding kinetics for different mAChR subtypes. Our findings not only offer insights into the structure and function of one of the most important GPCR families, but may also facilitate the design of improved therapeutics targeting these critical receptors. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Endocrine disruptors: From endocrine to metabolic disruption
AB  - Synthetic chemicals currently used in a variety of industrial and agricultural applications are leading to widespread contamination of the environment. Even though the intended uses of pesticides, plasticizers, antimicrobials, and flame retardants are beneficial, effects on human health are a global concern. These so-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can disrupt hormonal balance and result in developmental and reproductive abnormalities. New in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies link human EDC exposure with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Here we review themain chemical compounds that may contribute to metabolic disruption. We then present their demonstrated or suggested mechanisms of action with respect to nuclear receptor signaling. Finally, we discuss the difficulties of fairly assessing the risks linked to EDC exposure, including developmental exposure, problems of high- and low-dose exposure, and the complexity of current chemical environments. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

TI  - The neurobiological basis of spontaneous alternation
AB  - When placed in a T-maze, rats or mice possess a strong tendency of alternating arm choices on successive trials. The exploration of novel environmental stimuli is dependent on the integrity of limbic and non-limbic pathways, including the basal forebrain, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex, and the dorsal striatum, as well as the vestibular system and cerebellum. Neurochemical pathways using acetylcholine, gamma-amino-butyric acid, and dopamine in the septum and hippocampus have been implicated in the exploration of novel maze arms. In addition to the delineation of interactions between neurotransmitters, the spontaneous alternation test is sensitive to the consequences of normal and pathological aging. Copyright © 2002 .

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibition in estuarine fish and invertebrates as an indicator of organophosphorus insecticide exposure and effects
AB  - The majority of insecticides currently in use are organophosphorus, carbamate, and synthetic pyrethroid compounds. Organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) produce toxicity by inhibiting the cholinesterase enzymes in the nervous system. Monitoring of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been widely used in terrestrial and freshwater aquatic systems as an indicator of OP exposure and effects. This review describes the use of AChE inhibition as a biomarker in the estuarine environment, discusses the relationship between AChE inhibition and other manifestations of OP toxicity, and highlights areas where additional research is needed. A variety of studies with estuarine fish have suggested that brain AChE inhibition levels of >70% are associated with mortality in most species. Selected species, however, appear capable of tolerating much higher levels (>90%) of brain inhibition. Sublethal effects on stamina have been reported for some estuarine fish in association with brain AChE inhibition levels as low as 50%. Most studies suggest, however, that these effects are observed only when brain AChE inhibition is at near-lethal levels. A number of field studies have successfully used AChE inhibition in fish as a biomarker in the estuarine environment. The use of AChE inhibition as a biomarker in estuarine invertebrates has been less well studied. Although AChE inhibition has been measured in the tissues of a variety of invertebrate species following OP exposure, the relationship between AChE inhibition and lethality is less distinct. Additional work is needed in both fish and invertebrates to better explain species-specific differences in the relationship between AChE inhibition and mortality and to investigate other physiological perturbations associated with AChE inhibition.

TI  - Oxidative stress and the central nervous system
AB  - Biochemical integrity of the brain is vital for normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). One of the factors contributing to cerebral biochemical impairment is a chemical process called oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs upon excessive free radical production resulting from an insufficiency of the counteracting antioxidant response system. The brain, with its high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich content, is highly susceptible to oxidative stress. Therefore, oxidative stress-induced damage to the brain has a strong potential to negatively impact normal CNS functions. Although oxidative stress has historically been considered to be involved mainly in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease, its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression, is beginning to be recognized. This review is a discussion of the relevance of cerebral oxidative stress to impairment of emotional and mental well-being.

TI  - Anxiolytic effects of nicotine in zebrafish
AB  - Anxiolytic effects of nicotine have been documented in studies with rodents and humans. Understanding the neural basis of nicotine-induced anxiolysis can help both with developing better aids for smoking cessation as well as with the potential development of novel nicotinic ligands for treating anxiety. Complementary non-mammalian models may be useful for determining the molecular bases of nicotine effects on neurobehavioral function. The current project examined whether a zebrafish model of anxiety would be sensitive to nicotine. When zebrafish are placed in a novel environment, they dive to the bottom of the tank. In the wild, diving could help to escape predation. We tested the anxiolytic effect of nicotine on the novelty-elicited diving response and subsequent habituation. Zebrafish placed in a novel tank spent the majority of time at the bottom third of the tank during the first minute of a 5-min session and then show a gradual decrease in time spent at the tank bottom. Nicotine treatment at 100 mg/l for 3 min by immersion before testing caused a significant decrease in diving throughout the session, while 50 mg/l was effective during the first minute when the greatest bottom dwelling was seen in controls. Nicotine effects were reversed by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine given together with nicotine, but not when administered shortly before the test session after prior nicotine dosing. This implies that the effect of nicotine on diving was due to net stimulation at nicotinic receptors, an effect that is blocked by mecamylamine; and that once invoked, this effect is no longer dependent on continuing activation of nicotinic receptors. The effect of nicotine on diving did not seem to be the result of a general disorientation of the fish. The 100 mg/ml nicotine dose was shown in our earlier study to significantly improve spatial-discrimination learning in zebrafish. Nicotine-induced anxiolytic effects can be modeled in the zebrafish. This preparation will help in the investigation of the molecular bases of this effect. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - In vivo regulation of axon extension and pathfinding by growth-cone calcium transients
AB  - Growth cones at the tips of extending neurites migrate through complex environments in the developing nervous system and guide axons to appropriate target regions using local cues. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) of growth cones correlates with motility in vitro, but the physiological links between environmental cues and axon growth in vivo are unknown. Here we report that growth cones generate transient elevations of [Ca2+](i) as they migrate within the embryonic spinal cord and that the rate of axon outgrowth is inversely proportional to the frequency of transients. Suppressing Ca2+ transients by photorelease of a Ca2+ chelator accelerates axon extension, whereas mimicking transients with photorelease of Ca2+ slows otherwise rapid axonal growth. The frequency of Ca2+ transients is cell-type specific and depends on the position of growth cones along their pathway. Furthermore, growth-cone stalling and axon retraction, which are two important aspects of pathfinding, are associated with high frequencies of Ca2+ transients. Our results indicate that environmentally regulated growth-cone Ca2+ transients control axon growth in the developing spinal cord.

TI  - Occurrence of steroid estrogens, endocrine-disrupting phenols, and acid pharmaceutical residues in urban riverine water of the Pearl River Delta, South China
AB  - A scoping study was conducted to investigate the residues of nineteen pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), including 4 natural and 3 synthetic steroid estrogens, 7 endocrine-disrupting phenols, and 5 acid pharmaceuticals in three urban streams and the Major Pearl River at Guangzhou, a megapolis in the Pearl River Delta, South China. Estrone was detected in &gt; 60% water samples with a maximum concentration of 65 ng L- 1. Endocrine-disrupting phenols (nonylphenol, bisphenol A, triclosan, 2-phenylphenol, methyparaben, and propylparaben) were found to be widely present at rather high concentrations in the urban riverine water of Guangzhou. Salicylic acid, clofibric acid and ibuprofen were detected in most water samples with maximum concentrations of 2098, 248 and 1417 ng L- 1 respectively, whereas naproxen was less frequently detected and also at lower concentration. Both the detection frequencies and median concentrations of the PPCPs appeared higher during the low-flow season than during the high-flow season. The seasonal difference in PPCPs occurrence was probably attributed to the dilution effect caused by the rainfall. PPCPs in the urban riverine water of Guangzhou originated mainly from random discharge and/or leakage of municipal wastewater. PPCPs contamination in the Major Pearl River may be of a potential environmental issue, especially during the low-flow season. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bisphenol A and other bisphenol analogues including BPS and BPF in surface water samples from Japan, China, Korea and India
AB  - Concentrations of eight bisphenol analogues (BPs) including BPA, BPS, and BPF were determined in surface waters collected from select rivers in Japan, Korea, China, and India. BPA was found at a concentration in the range of several tens to several hundreds of nanograms per liter in most of the rivers surveyed and some of the highest concentrations (54-1950. ng/L) were found in rivers in Chennai, India. Concentrations of BPF were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of BPA in river and sea waters collected from Japan, Korea and China, which suggested that BPF is a major contaminant in surface waters in several Southeast Asian countries. BPF concentrations as high as 2850 ng/L were found in the Tamagawa River in Japan. The flux of BPs through riverine discharges into Tokyo Bay was calculated to be approximately 5.5. t per year. Based on the flux estimates and the mass of BPF found in water column and sediment in Tokyo Bay, it was found that BPF degrades faster than BPA in the environment. Elevated concentrations of BPF found in surface waters suggest the need for further studies to determine the fate and toxicity of this compound. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Complexity of dopamine metabolism
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) coincides with a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. A key player in the loss of dopaminergic neurons is oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) metabolism itself is strongly linked to oxidative stress as its degradation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DA oxidation can lead to endogenous neurotoxins whereas some DA derivatives show antioxidative effects. Therefore, DA metabolism is of special importance for neuronal redox-homeostasis and viability.In this review we highlight different aspects of dopamine metabolism in the context of PD and neurodegeneration. Since most reviews focus only on single aspects of the DA system, we will give a broader overview by looking at DA biosynthesis, sequestration, degradation and oxidation chemistry at the metabolic level, as well as at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational regulation of all enzymes involved. This is followed by a short overview of cellular models currently used in PD research. Finally, we will address the topic from a medical point of view which directly aims to encounter PD. © 2013 Meiser et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Alarm substance induced behavioral responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Zebrafish (zebra danio) are becoming increasingly popular in behavioral neuroscience and behavior genetics. This small vertebrate may be utilized in modeling human brain disorders. One of the major neuropsychiatric conditions still not well understood is abnormally increased fear and anxiety. Zebrafish may be an appropriate organism with which these human diseases can be modeled and their biological mechanisms investigated. Predator induced anxiety paradigms have been suggested as useful methods in translational research. Shoaling fish, such as zebrafish, are known to respond to alarm substances with antipredatory or alarm reactions. However, these responses are not well characterized in zebrafish. In the current paper, we investigate the behavioral responses of zebrafish elicited by its alarm substance. Using observation-based as well as video-tracking aided behavior quantification methods we demonstrate significant alarm substance-induced behavioral changes that are independent of the presence of a predatory fish stimulus. The results suggest that, once refined, the use of alarm substance with zebrafish will allow the development of high throughput behavioral paradigms for drug and mutation screening aimed at the analysis of the biological mechanisms of fear in vertebrates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam effects in a zebrafish model of anxiety
AB  - Zebrafish are becoming more widely used to study neurobehavioral pharmacology. We have developed a method to assess novel environment diving behavior of zebrafish as a model of stress response and anxiolytic drug effects. In a novel tank, zebrafish dwell in the bottom of the tank initially and then increase their swimming exploration to higher levels over time. We previously found that nicotine, which has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans, significantly lessens the novel tank diving response in zebrafish. The specificity of the diving effect was validated with a novel vs. non-novel test tank. The novel tank diving response of zebrafish was tested when given three anxiolytic drugs from two different chemical and pharmacological classes: buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. When the test tank was novel the diving response was clearly seen whereas it was significantly reduced when the test tank was not novel. Buspirone, a serotonergic (5HT1A receptor agonist) anxiolytic drug with some D2 dopaminergic effect, had a pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the zebrafish diving model at doses that did not have sedative effects. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, which is an effective agonist at GABA-A receptors, did not produce signs of anxiolysis in zebrafish over a broad dose range up to those that caused sedation. Diazepam another benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug did produce an anxiolytic effect at doses that did not cause sedation. The zebrafish novel tank diving task can be useful in discriminating anxiolytic drugs of several classes (serotonergic, benzodiazepines and nicotinic). © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase is required for neuronal and muscular development in the zebrafish embryo
AB  - The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) has a crucial role in central and neuromuscular synapses of the cholinergic system. After release into the synaptic cleft, ACh is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). We have identified a mutation in the ache gene of the zebrafish, which abolishes ACh hydrolysis in homozygous animals completely. Embryos are initially motile but subsequently develop paralysis. Mutant embryos show defects in muscle fiber formation and innervation, and primary sensory neurons die prematurely. The neuromuscular phenotype in ache mutants is suppressed by a homozygous loss-of-function allele of the α-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), indicating that the impairment of neuromuscular development is mediated by activation of nAChR in the mutant. Here we provide genetic evidence for non-classical functions of AChE in vertebrate development. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Adult zebrafish as a model organism for behavioural genetics
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated the suitability of adult zebrafish to model some aspects of complex behaviour. Studies of reward behaviour, learning and memory, aggression, anxiety and sleep strongly suggest that conserved regulatory processes underlie behaviour in zebrafish and mammals. The isolation and molecular analysis of zebrafish behavioural mutants is now starting, allowing the identification of novel behavioural control genes. As a result of this, studies of adult zebrafish are now helping to uncover the genetic pathways and neural circuits that control vertebrate behaviour. © 2010 Norton and Bally-Cuif; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Abnormal behaviours induced by chemical pollution: A review of the evidence and new challenges
AB  - Many chemical pollutants have become ubiquitous in the environment, including some that interfere with hormones and other physiological mechanisms. These 'endocrine-disrupting chemicals' (EDCs) have harmful effects on development and physiology. We reviewed published evidence and found that EDCs also have adverse effects on a wide range of behaviours, including sexual and other reproductive behaviours, activity, motivation, communication, aggression, dominance and other social behaviours, and learning and other cognitive abilities. We also reviewed recent findings that challenge common assumptions in toxicology. For example, EDCs have several unanticipated properties, such as nonmonotonic dose effects and synergy. Furthermore, harmful effects of EDCs sometimes become apparent only when tested in natural ecological conditions, such as social stress and infection. These findings raise questions about the practicality and feasibility of testing chemical pollutants adequately. Finally, we discuss the implications of EDC research for species conservation and human health, and how toxicology and behavioural research might be better integrated. Behaviour might provide a useful indicator or biomarker for detecting harmful chemical contaminants; however, more integration between toxicology and behavioural ecology is needed to determine whether and how EDCs affect humans and other vertebrates outside of the laboratory. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Aggression and vasotocin are associated with dominant-subordinate relationships in zebrafish
AB  - Agonistic interactions are present throughout the animal kingdom as well as in humans. In this report, we present a model system to study neurological correlates of dominant-subordinate relationships. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been used as a model system for developmental biology for decades. We propose here that it is also an excellent model for studying social behavior. Adult male zebrafish were separated for 5 days and then pairs were formed and allowed to interact for 5 days. Under these conditions, aggression is prevalent and dominant-subordinate relationships are quickly established. Dominant behavior is characterized by a repeated pattern of chasing and biting, whereas subordinates engage in retreats. By day 5, the dominant-subordinate relationship was firmly established and there were differences in behavior over time. Chases, bites and retreats were all less frequent on day 5 of the social interaction than on day 1. Arginine vasotocin is the teleostean homologue of arginine vasopressin, a neuropeptide whose expression has been linked to aggression and social position in mammals. Immunohistochemistry indicated differences in vasotocin staining between dominant and subordinate individuals. Dominant individuals express vasotocin in one to three pairs of large cells in the magnocellular preoptic area whereas subordinate individuals express vasotocin in 7-11 pairs of small cells in the parvocellular preoptic area. These results suggest that the vasotocinergic system may play a role in shaping dominant-subordinate relationships and agonistic behavior in this model organism. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Measuring thigmotaxis in larval zebrafish
AB  - One of the most commonly used behavioral endpoints measured in preclinical studies using rodent models is thigmotaxis (or "wall-hugging"). Thigmotaxis is a well-validated index of anxiety in animals and humans. While assays measuring thigmotaxis in adult zebrafish have been developed, a thigmotaxis assay has not yet been validated in larval zebrafish. Here we present a novel assay for measurement of thigmotaxis in zebrafish larvae that is triggered by a sudden change in illumination (i.e. sudden light-to-darkness transition) and performed in a standard 24-well plate. We show that zebrafish larvae as young as 5 days post fertilization respond to this challenge by engaging in thigmotaxis. Thigmotaxis was significantly attenuated by anxiolytic (diazepam) and significantly enhanced by anxiogenic (caffeine) drugs, thus representing the first validated thigmotaxis assay for larval zebrafish. We also show that exposure to sudden darkness per se may represent an anxiogenic situation for larval zebrafish since less contrasting light-to-darkness transitions (achieved by lowering darkness degrees) significantly decreased thigmotaxis levels in a manner similar to what was achieved with diazepam. These findings suggest that stimuli such as exposure to sudden darkness could be used proficiently to trigger the expression of anxiety-like behaviors in laboratory settings. In sum, this is a versatile protocol allowing testing of both anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs in a cost-effective manner (only 10. min). This assay is also amenable to medium to high-throughput capacity while constituting a valuable tool for stress and central nervous system research as well as for preclinical drug screening and discovery. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Relationship between environmental phthalate exposure and the intelligence of school-age children
AB  - Background: Concern over phthalates has emerged because of their potential toxicity to humans. Objective: We investigated the relationship between the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and children's intellectual functioning. Methods: This study enrolled 667 children at nine elementary schools in five South Korean cities. A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on neuropsychological tests were obtained from both the children and their mothers. Results: We measured mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), both metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), in urine samples. The geometric mean (ln) concentrations of MEHP, MEOHP, and MBP were 21.3 μg/L [geometric SD (GSD) = 2.2 μg/L; range, 0.5-445.4], 18.0 μg/L (GSD = 2.4; range, 0.07-291.1), and 48.9 μg/L (GSD = 2.2; range, 2.1-1645.5), respectively. After adjusting for demographic and developmental covariates, the Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ scores were negatively associated with DEHP metabolites but not with DBP metabolites. We also found a significant negative relationship between the urine concentrations of the metabolites of DEHP and DBP and children's vocabulary subscores. After controlling for maternal IQ, a significant inverse relationship between DEHP metabolites and vocabulary subscale score remained. Among boys, we found a negative association between increasing MEHP phthalate concentrations and the sum of DEHP metabolite concentrations and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children vocabulary score; however, among girls, we found no significant association between these variables. Conclusion: Controlling for maternal IQ and other covariates, the results show an inverse relationship between phthalate metabolites and IQ scores; however, given the limitations in cross-sectional epidemiology, prospective studies are needed to fully explore these associations.

TI  - Toxicity, uptake kinetics and behavior assessment in zebrafish embryos following exposure to perfluorooctanesulphonicacid (PFOS)
AB  - Perfluorooctanesulphonicacid (PFOS), a persistent organic contaminant, has been widely detected in the environment, wildlife and humans, but few studies have assessed its effect on aquatic organisms. The present study evaluated the effect of PFOS on zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish embryos exhibited developmental toxicity of bent spine, uninflated swim bladder, decreased heart rate and affected spontaneous movement after exposure to various PFOS concentrations (0-8mg/L) from 6 to 120h post-fertilization (hpf). The LC50 at 120hpf was 2.20mg/L and the EC50 at 120hpf was 1.12mg/L. Continuous exposure to PFOS from 1 to 121hpf resulted in a steady accumulation with no evidence of elimination. PFOS induced cell death at 24hpf was consistently found in the brain, eye, and tail region of embryos. PFOS exposure induced lesions in the muscle fibers with histological examination. Behavior assessment of PFOS in zebrafish embryos elevated the basal rate of swimming after 4 days of exposure, and larvae exposed to PFOS (0.25-4mg/L) for only 1h at 6dpf swam faster with increasing PFOS concentration. Embryos/larvae exposed to 8mg/L PFOS for 24h periods from 1 to 121hpf showed the highest incidence of malformations in the 97-121hpf window. This is the first study to define uptake kinetics and to focus on behavioral consequences following PFOS exposure in zebrafish. Our results further the understanding of the toxicity of PFOS to aquatic organisms and suggest the need for additional research to identify the mode of PFOS toxicity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characterization of behavioral and endocrine effects of LSD on zebrafish
AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogenic drug that strongly affects animal and human behavior. Although adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a promising neurobehavioral model, the effects of LSD on zebrafish have not been investigated previously. Several behavioral paradigms (the novel tank, observation cylinder, light-dark box, open field, T-maze, social preference and shoaling tests), as well as modern video-tracking tools and whole-body cortisol assay were used to characterize the effects of acute LSD in zebrafish. While lower doses (5-100μg/L) did not affect zebrafish behavior, 250μg/L LSD increased top dwelling and reduced freezing in the novel tank and observation cylinder tests, also affecting spatiotemporal patterns of activity (as assessed by 3D reconstruction of zebrafish traces and ethograms). LSD evoked mild thigmotaxis in the open field test, increased light behavior in the light-dark test, reduced the number of arm entries and freezing in the T-maze and social preference test, without affecting social preference. In contrast, LSD affected zebrafish shoaling (increasing the inter-fish distance in a group), and elevated whole-body cortisol levels. Overall, our findings show sensitivity of zebrafish to LSD action, and support the use of zebrafish models to study hallucinogenic drugs of abuse. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Occurrence and partitioning of bisphenol analogues in water and sediment from Liaohe River Basin and Taihu Lake, China
AB  - Bisphenol analogues are widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, and the demand and production capacity of these compounds are growing rapidly in China. The occurrence and distribution of bisphenol analogues other than bisphenol A (BPA) in the aquatic environment is still poorly understood. In this study, nine bisphenol analogues were measured in water and sediment samples from Taihu Lake (TL), Liaohe River basin, including Liaohe River (LR) and Hunhe River (HR), China. Water samples from LR and HR contained much higher total bisphenols (∑BPs) concentrations. BPA and bisphenol S (BPS) were predominant with a summed contribution of 55, 75, and 75% to the ∑BPs in TL, LR, and HR waters, respectively. This suggests that BPA and BPS were the most widely used and manufactured bisphenols in these regions. In sediment, BPA was always predominant, with the next abundant compound bisphenol F (BPF) in TL and HR sediment, but BPS in LR sediment. The average field sediment–water partitioning coefficients (log K oc ) were calculated for the first time for certain bisphenols and were determined to be 4.7, 4.6, 3.8, 3.7, and 3.5 mL/g for BPF, BPAP, BPA, BPAF, and BPS, respectively. © 2016

TI  - The adverse health effects of bisphenol A and related toxicity mechanisms
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial component commonly used in synthesis of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resin and other polymer materials. Due to its mass productions and widespread applications, the presence of BPA is ubiquitous in the environment. BPA can enter the body via different ways such as digestive tract, respiratory tract and dermal tract. As an endocrine disruptor, BPA has estrogen-like and anti-androgen effects causing damages to different tissues and organs, including reproductive system, immune system and neuroendocrine system, etc. Recently, it has been shown that BPA could induce carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in animal models. Here, the underlying mechanisms of BPA-induced multi-organ toxicity were well summarized, involving the receptor pathways, disruption of neuroendocrine system, inhibition of enzymes, modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, as well as genotoxic and epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this review is to compile the available current research data regarding BPA and provide an overview of the current status of BPA exposure and relevant health effects covering reproductive, developmental, metabolic, immuno, respiratory, hepatic and renal toxicity and carcinogenesis of BPA. This review provides comprehensive data of BPA toxicity on human health and related mechanisms. We also identify any missing data which should be addressed by further studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Screening of currently used pesticides in water, sediments and biota of the Guadalquivir River Basin (Spain)
AB  - The occurrence of 50 currently used pesticides and their transformation products in surface and waste waters, sediment and fish in the Guadalquivir River Basin was determined in 2010 and 2011. After selective sample extraction, pesticides were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The contamination profile in water and sediments is marked by the presence of organophosphorus and triazines. Transformation products were even at higher concentrations than parent pesticides. A wider range of pesticides was present in water than in sediments but none of them were detected in fish. The mean concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 13.0. ng/L in water and from 0.1 to 13.2. ng/g d.w. in sediment. The spatial distribution of most pesticides was consistent with the agricultural activities of the area or their urban applications. The waste water treatment plant effluents that impact the river are minor sources for few pesticides but for most of them run-off would be the most important contribution. The temporal distribution showed differences between both sampling campaigns related to the river flow. The low-flow produced a pesticide concentration effect, generating higher levels in water and accumulation in sediments. This forecasts a hazard in future scenarios if the current situation of the climate change and water scarcity evolves to more critical conditions highlighting the need of these monitoring studies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Shoal choice in zebrafish, Danio rerio: The influence of shoal size and activity
AB  - Shoaling fish are expected, in many cases, to gain fitness benefits from being in a larger shoal and previous experiments have shown that fish are indeed capable of choosing between shoals of different sizes. We investigated the influence of shoal activity on shoal size preference in the zebrafish. We gave test fish the choice between shoals of one to four stimulus fish, presented at two different water temperatures, and so differing in their activity levels. Where all stimulus fish were in water of the same temperature, test fish generally preferred the larger shoal. However, this preference could be reduced by presenting the larger shoal in colder water and so reducing its activity. We discuss these findings with reference to the factors that may influence shoal activity, the effect of temperature on shoaling behaviour and the mechanisms that may be used by fish to discriminate shoal size. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Development of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for high throughput determination of organophosphorus flame retardants in environmental water
AB  - Widely used as flame retardants, organophosphate esters (OPEs) are now broadly present in the indoor and outdoor environments. Currently available liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods share some drawbacks with gas chromatography (GC) methods, including time consuming, limited target OPEs, incomplete separation capability for some OPEs and low throughput. In this study, a fast and high throughput LC-MS/MS method was developed. For the first time, all the twelve OPEs that have been studied in literature, ranging from the very polar and volatile trimethyl phosphate to the very hydrophobic and non-volatile tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, were separated within 11. min. Different from previous studies, we found that the blank contamination was mainly from organic mobile phase rather than the enrichment process, and it can be efficiently eliminated by using acetonitrile rather than methanol as the organic phase of the mobile phase. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) was significantly improved by using 0.1% formic acid as an organic modifier. The method exhibited high throughput and sensitivity and can baseline separate 11 of the 12 OPEs studied within 11. min with LOQs ranging from 2 to 6. ng/L. The relative standard deviations were in the range of 2-10%. For both reagent water and river water, the spiked recoveries of OPEs ranged from 70 to 110%, except for the very polar and volatile trimethyl phosphate that has recovery below 10%. The developed procedure was successfully applied to study the OPE contamination of the Songhua River, and it was found that all the target OPEs were detected with total concentrations of around 1 μg/L in the river waters. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Timing and plasticity of shoaling behaviour in the zebrafish, Danio rerio
AB  - The zebrafish has become a major model system for biomedical research and is an emerging model for the study of behaviour. Although adult zebrafish express a visually mediated shoaling preference, the onset of shoaling behaviour and of this preference is unknown. To assess the onset of these behaviours, we first manipulated the early social environment of larval zebrafish subjects, giving them three model shoaling partners of the same pigment phenotype. We then assayed the subjects' preferences using binary preference tests in which we presented subjects with two shoals, one shoal of fish showing the same pigment pattern phenotype as their models and another shoal with a radically different pigment pattern. To determine whether the visually mediated preference could be altered once it was established, we further manipulated the social environment of a number of subjects, rearing them with one model shoal and testing them, then changing their social consorts and retesting them. Our results show that larval zebrafish shoal early in their development, but do not show a shoaling preference until they are juveniles. Moreover, we found that the shoaling preference was stable, as changing the social environment of fish after they had acquired a preference did not change their preference. These findings will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms underlying social behaviour in this vertebrate model system. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates and infant neurobehavior
AB  - Objective: To examine the association of prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and select common phthalates with infant neurobehavior measured at 5. weeks. Methods: We compared the concentration of maternal urinary metabolites of bisphenol A and phthalates at two distinct time points in pregnancy (16w, 26w) with scores on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 5. weeks of age in a cohort of 350 mother/infant pairs. Results: Prenatal exposure to BPA was not significantly associated with neurobehavioral outcomes at 5. weeks. Significant associations between prenatal exposure to measured phthalates and infant neurobehavioral outcomes differed by type of phthalate and were only seen with exposure measured at 26. weeks. Higher total di-butyl phthalate (DBP) metabolites at 26w were associated with improved behavioral organization evidenced by decreased arousal (p = .04), increased self-regulation (p = .052), and decreased handling (p = .02). In males, higher total di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites at 26w were associated with more nonoptimal reflexes (p = .02). Conclusion: The association between prenatal phthalate exposure and infant neurobehavior differed by type of phthalate and was evident only with exposure measured at 26w. Prenatal exposure to DBP was associated with improved behavioral organization in 5-week-old infants. Prenatal exposure to DEHP was associated with nonoptimal reflexes in male infants. There was no evidence of an association between prenatal BPA exposure and infant neurobehavior. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Shoaling develops with age in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - The biological mechanisms of human social behavior are complex. Animal models may facilitate the understanding of these mechanisms and may help one to develop treatment strategies for abnormal human social behavior, a core symptom in numerous clinical conditions. The zebrafish is perhaps the most social vertebrate among commonly used laboratory species. Given its practical features and the numerous genetic tools developed for it, it should be a promising tool. Zebrafish shoal, i.e. from a tight multimember groups, but the ontogenesis of this behavior has not been described. Analyzing the development of shoaling is a step towards discovering the mechanisms of this behavior. Here we study age-dependent changes of shoaling in zebrafish from day 7 post fertilization to over 5. months of age by measuring the distance between all pairs of fish in freely swimming groups of ten subjects. Our longitudinal (repeated measure within subject) and cross sectional (non-repeated measure between subject) analyses both demonstrated a significant increase of shoaling with age (decreased distance between shoal members). Given the sophisticated genetic and developmental biology methods already available for zebrafish, we argue that our behavioral results open a new avenue towards the understanding of the development of vertebrate social behavior and of its mechanisms and abnormalities. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Contamination levels of selected organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides in the Selangor River, Malaysia between 2002 and 2003
AB  - In Malaysia, rivers are the main source of public water supplies. This study was conducted from 2002 to 2003 to determine the levels of selected organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides in the Selangor River in Malaysia. Surface water samples have been collected seasonally from nine sites along the river. A liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was used to determine the trace levels of these pesticide residues. The organochlorine pesticides detected were lindane, heptachlor, endosulfan, dieldrin, endosulfan sulfate, o,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDE whereas for organophosphate pesticides, they were chlorpyrifos and diazinon. At the river upstream where a dam is located for public water supply, incidents of pesticide levels exceeding the European Economic Community Directive of water quality standards have occurred. Furthermore, the wetland ecosystems located at the downstream of the river which houses the fireflies community is being threatened by occasional pesticide levels above EPA limits for freshwater aquatic organisms. The occurrence of these residual pesticides in the Selangor River can be attributed to the intense agriculture and urban activity. © 2006.

TI  - The effects of environmental neurotoxicants on the dopaminergic system: A possible role in drug addiction
AB  - Humans are routinely exposed to a vast array of environmental neurotoxicants, including pesticides, endocrine disrupters, and heavy metals. The long-term consequences of exposure have become a major human health concern as research has indicated strong associations between neurotoxicants and a variety of dopamine-related neurological disorders. Developmental exposure to pesticides including paraquat, organochlorines, and rotenone produce alterations in the dopaminergic system and has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Endocrine disrupters such as Bisphenol A, mimic estrogenic activity and impact various dopaminergic processes to enhance mesolimbic dopamine activity resulting in hyperactivity, attention deficits, and a heightened sensitivity to drugs of abuse. A second class of endocrine disrupters, the polychlorinated biphenyls, may act directly on dopaminergic processes to disrupt the dopamine system and produce Parkinson-like symptoms. Exposure to the heavy metal lead enhances dopaminergic activity and has been associated with attention deficits, Alzheimer's disease, and increased drug sensitivity. Manganese exposure, in contrast, results in dopamine deficiencies and Parkinson-like symptoms. Therefore, this commentary will discuss the effects and consequences that exposure to these three classes of environmental neurotoxicants have on the dopamine system and related behaviors and disorders. Finally, the recent hypothesis that exposure to environmental compounds which have effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Bisphenol A, and multiple heavy metals, may potentiate drug-induced behaviors and increase the brain's vulnerability to drug addiction will be discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Behavioural biologists do not agree on what constitutes behaviour
AB  - Behavioural biology is a major discipline within biology, centred on the key concept of 'behaviour'. But how is 'behaviour' defined, and how should it be defined? We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Locomotor behaviors in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae
AB  - Locomotor behaviors were examined in two experiments using zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae at 4, 5, 6 and 7 days post fertilization (dpf). Larvae were observed in individual wells of a 12-well plate for 1. h a day. In Experiment 1, the same larvae were observed for four consecutive days beginning on post-fertilization day 4; in Experiment 2, different groups of larvae from the same egg collection were observed at 4, 5, 6 and 7. dpf. Automated images collected every 6. s were analyzed for information about larval location, orientation and general activity. In both experiments, 4. dpf larvae rested significantly more, used a smaller area of the well more frequently, and were generally less active than older larvae. All larvae exhibited a preference for facing away from the center of the well and for the edge of the well. However, prolonged exposure to the well influenced overall activity, orientation, and preference for the edge region. The implications of these results for understanding the development of larval behavior and for the design of procedures to measure the effects of experience in zebrafish larvae are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Occurrence and sources of selected phenolic endocrine disruptors in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal
AB  - Background, aim and scope: Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) is a shallow coastal lagoon of high economic and ecological importance. Hardly any data on its chemical pollution by polar organic pollutants are available in literature. This study focused on the presence and sources of a series of phenolic endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in this area, including parabens, alkylphenolic compounds and bisphenol-A (BPA). A number of possible sources of pollution are present in the area, including the large harbours present in the lagoon, the city of Aveiro and the rivers discharging into the area. A recently constructed submarine wastewater outfall, located a few kilometres from the lagoon inlet has also been suggested as a possible source of pollution to Ria de Aveiro in several publications. The aim of the current field study was to investigate the occurrence and main sources of phenolic endocrine disruptors in Ria de Aveiro. Materials and methods: An extensive sampling campaign was performed, with surface water and wastewater grab samples taken at over 50 locations, in duplicate on different days. Samples were treated using solid phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results and discussion: Concentrations in lagoon water were generally low: not exceeding 20 ng/L for most analytes. Levels in river water exceeded those in the lagoon by a factor 3 to 500 (o-phenylphenol (PhP) and nonylphenoxy ethoxy acetic acids (A9PEC), respectively), with concentrations up to 700 ng/L for BPA and 7,300 ng/L for A9PEC. Samples from the harbours showed EDC levels similar to those in the rest of the lagoon, but in the city of Aveiro, elevated concentrations were observed for alkylphenol ethoxylates (A9PEO), A9PEC, PhP and BPA. Wastewater effluents showed low levels for parabens, whilst alkylphenolic compounds reached several micrograms per litre. The effluents are discharged into the ocean via a submarine outfall, but as marine water near the outfall showed slightly elevated concentrations only for A9PEO, it does not seem to be a significant source of these EDCs for the area. Conclusions: All the studied phenolic EDCs were detected in the study area, with high levels found in some of the rivers discharging into the lagoon, and generally low concentrations in the lagoon itself. The main sources for all investigated EDCs were the rivers Caster and Antuã which discharge into the lagoon. The city of Aveiro was identified as a secondary source. As the tidal water exchange volume is much larger than the freshwater input from the rivers, concentrations of phenolic EDCs remained low in the lagoon. © 2009 The Author(s).

This discussion paper provides an overview of the field of combined effects in aquatic ecotoxicology and addresses some of the major challenges related to assessment of combined effects in connection with environmental risk assessment (ERA) and regulation. Potentials and obstacles related to different experimental, modelling and predictive ERA approaches are described. On-going ERA guideline and manual developments in Europe aiming to incorporate combined effects of contaminants, the use of different experimental approaches for providing combined effect data, the involvement of biomarkers to characterize Mode of Action and toxicity pathways and efforts to identify relevant risk scenarios related to combined effects are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Behavioral and physiological effects of acute ketamine exposure in adult zebrafish
AB  - Ketamine is a non-competitive glutamatergic antagonist used to induce sedation and analgesia. In sub-anesthetic doses, it induces hyperlocomotion, impairs memory and evokes stereotypic circling in rodents. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) emerged as a promising new animal model to screen the effects of psychotropic compounds. Here, we investigated the effects of sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine on anxiety, locomotion, habituation and social behavior of adult zebrafish. Acute 20-min exposure to 20 and 40. mg/L (but not 2. mg/L) of ketamine reduced anxiety, impaired intra-session habituation, evoked circular swimming and disrupted zebrafish shoaling. Additionally, ketamine reduced whole-body cortisol levels and elevated brain c-fos expression in zebrafish. Our findings demonstrate the sensitivity of zebrafish to behavioral and physiological effects of sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine, further supporting the utility of this species as a model for neuropharmacological research, including testing ketamine and related drugs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Endocrine disruptors leading to obesity and related diseases
AB  - The review aims to comprehensively present the impact of exposure to endocrine disruptors (EDs) in relation to the clinical manifestation of obesity and related diseases, including diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, carcinogenesis and infertility. EDs are strong participants in the obesity epidemic scenery by interfering with cellular morphological and biochemical processes, by inducing inﬂammatory responses, and by presenting transcriptional and oncogenic activity. Obesity and lipotoxicity enhancement occur through reprogramming and/or remodeling of germline epigenome by exposure to EDs. Specific population groups are vulnerable to ED exposure due to current dietary and environmental conditions. Obesity, morbidity and carcinogenicity induced by ED exposure are an evolving reality. Therefore, a new collective strategic approach is deemed essential, for the reappraisal of current global conditions pertaining to energy management. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Early embryonic ethanol exposure impairs shoaling and the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems in adult zebrafish
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a devastating disorder accompanied by numerous morphological and behavioral abnormalities. Human FAS has been modeled in laboratory animals including the zebrafish. Recently, embryonic exposure to low doses of ethanol has been shown to impair behavior without any gross morphological alterations in zebrafish. The exposed zebrafish showed reduced responses to animated conspecific images. The effect of embryonic ethanol exposure, however, has not been investigated in a real shoal and the potential mechanisms underlying the behavioral impairment are also unknown. Here we show that a 2. h long immersion in 0.25% and 0.50% (vol/vol) alcohol at 24. h post fertilization significantly increases the distance among members of freely swimming groups of zebrafish when measured at 70. days post fertilization. We also show that this impaired behavior is accompanied by reduced levels of dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin and 5HIAA as quantified by HPLC from whole brain extracts. Our results demonstrate that even very low concentrations of alcohol applied for a short period of time during the development of zebrafish can impair behavior and brain function. We argue that the observed behavioral impairment is not likely to be due to altered performance capabilities, e.g. motor function or perception, but possibly to social behavior itself. We also argue that our neurochemical data represent the first step towards understanding the mechanisms of this abnormality in zebrafish, which may lead to better modeling of, and ultimately perhaps better therapies for human FAS. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Prenatal transfer of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) results in developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae
AB  - Parental exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in animals has been found to be transferred to the offspring. The environmental health risk and toxicity to the offspring are still unclear. The objective of the present study was to identify environmentally relevant concentrations of PBDEs for parental exposure that would cause developmental neurotoxicity in the offspring. Adult zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of DE-71 (0.16, 0.8, 4.0 μg/L) via water. The results showed that PBDE exposure did not affect larvae hatching, malformation, or survival. The residue of PBDEs was detected in F1 eggs upon parental exposure. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was significantly inhibited in F1 larvae. Genes of central nervous system development (e.g., myelin basic protein, synapsin IIa, α1-tubulin) were significantly downregulated in larvae. Protein levels of α1-tubulin and synapsin IIa were also reduced. Decreased locomotion activity was observed in the larvae. This study provides the first evidence that parental exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PBDEs could cause adverse effects on neurodevelopment in zebrafish offspring. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Shoaling in zebrafish: What we don't know
AB  - Zebrafish have been gaining increasing popularity in behavioral neuroscience. However, the number of behavioral test paradigms specifically designed for zebrafish, and in general the amount of information available on the behavior of this species, is relatively small when compared with classical laboratory model organisms such as the mouse, the rat, and the fruit fly. A particularly typical behavioral feature of zebrafish is shoaling, i.e., group formation. Given the importance of social behavior in our own species and the fact that zebrafish possess several characteristics similar to those of other vertebrates, including humans, at many levels of biological organization (e.g., neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, biochemical processes, and amino acid sequence of proteins or nucleotide sequence of genes), the zebrafish is expected to be an excellent tool not only for basic research but perhaps also for translational research. Briefly, we propose that once social behavior of the zebrafish is better characterized and once appropriate behavioral methods have been developed, this species can be utilized for the analysis of the mechanisms of social behavior of other vertebrates including our own. In this review, we discuss general principles of shoaling and highlight what we know and what we do not know about this behavior as it pertains to zebrafish. Copyright © by Walter de Gruyter.

TI  - Exposure analysis of bisphenol A in surface water systems in North America and Europe
AB  - This study was conducted to develop a statistical understanding of exposures to bisphenol A (BPA) in aquatic environments in North America and Europe. Concentrations of BPA have been reported by 89 investigations published between 1997 and 2007. On the basis of an analysis of weighted observations (n = 1068 and 848 for North America and Europe, respectively), BPA was reported at concentrations above the detection limit in 20-51% of freshwater samples. Median BPA concentrations for fresh surface waters for North America and Europe were 0.081 and 0.01 μg/L, respectively, while 95th percentiles were 0.47 and 0.35 μg/L, respectively. In contrast to fresh surface waters, only limited data are available for sediments and less for marine ecosystems. For freshwater sediments in North America (n = 71), the median and 90th percentile concentration (the 95th percentile was not calculable) were 0.6 and 3.4 ng/g-dw, respectively, while the median and 95th percentile concentration in Europe (n = 249) were 16 and 256 ng/g-dw, respectively. To assess the potential ecological significance, we compared exposure concentrations with available regulatory criteria. The results suggest the frequency of locations in which concentrations are likely to cause adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems is low, with the exception of sediments collected from some highly urbanized and industrial locations. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Distribution of phthalate esters in air, water, sediments, and fish in the Asan Lake of Korea
AB  - Phthalate esters (PEs) are the most commonly used plasticizers and one of the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which are extensively present in various environment. Therefore, it is important to examine the levels and distribution of phthalates in multimedia environment. This study investigated the seasonal and spatial variation of 14 PEs in air, water, sediments, and fish in the Asan Lake. Asan Lake is one of the largest artificial lakes in Korea, and is surrounded by industrial complex and farmlands. The PEs were found to be present throughout the study area. The mean concentration of total PEs (∑14 PEs) was 3.92–33.09 ng/m3 in air, not detected (n.d.)-2.29 μg/L in water, 3.6–8973 μg/kg dry weight (dw) in sediment, and n.d.-1081 μg/kg dw in fish, respectively. The most frequently detected phthalate in the samples was di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and followed by di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). The concentrations of PEs in water and sediment samples tended to decrease moving downstream of Asan Lake. Bioaccumulation of PEs showed that benthic feeding fish such as crucian carp or skygager contained higher levels of DEHP. Partitioning of DEHP and DBP between water and sediment was calculated using paired sediment/water samples and fugacity fraction (ff). High ff value (ff = 0.89 ± 0.1) of DBP and low ff value of DEHP (ff = 0.24 ± 0.1) confirmed that DEHP is the most abundant PEs in the sediment, and DBP is the second most abundant PEs except DEHP in water. Our results can provide important information of the distribution and behavior of PEs in the lake environment. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Measuring emissions of organophosphate flame retardants using a passive flux sampler
AB  - Flame retardants are used in polymers to reduce the flammability of building materials, electric appliances, fabric and papers. In recent years, organophosphate flame retardants have been used as substitutes for polybrominated flame retardants (BFRs). In Japan, the amount of organophosphate flame retardants used in 2001 was about five times more than in 2000. Recently, several studies have shown the health concerns for some organophosphate flame retardants. Little research has been performed on the emission of organophosphate flame retardants, especially the relationship between content and emissions. In this study, a new type of passive sampler was developed to measure emissions of organophosphate flame retardants from plastic materials. With this sampler, emissions from polyvinyl chloride wallpaper samples with different content of tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCPP) at different temperatures were examined. The observed maximum emissions of TCPP from 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 w/w% content wallpaper materials were 262.3, 452.6, 644.8, 1119.1 and 2166.8 μg m-2 h-1, respectively. Emissions from 5% TCPP content materials at 40 and 60 °C were 1135.7 and 2841.2 μg m-2 h-1, respectively. A significantly positive correlation between the flux of TCPP and the TCPP content of the wallpaper samples was observed. A linear relationship was found between the inverse of temperature and the logarithm of TCPP emission. The results imply that the use of materials with a high organophosphate flame retardant content can lead to high emission rates in high-temperature indoor environments. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The effects of early and adult social environment on zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior
AB  - Because early social experience can have a profound effect on later mate and social choices, the availability of options and decisions made early in development can have major effects on adult behavior. Herein, we use strain differences among zebrafish, Danio rerio, as an experimental tool to test the effects of social experience on behavior. By manipulating the strain composition of groups in which the subject fish are housed at different ages, we tested (1) whether mixing with dissimilar individuals influenced subsequent behavior, (2) whether prolonged mixing during the juvenile stage had a more pronounced effect than a shorter period of mixing during adulthood and (3) whether mixing had a lasting effect after animals were resorted into groups of same strain animals. We found that social experience had a profound impact on social behavior. Both Nadia and TM1 individuals engaged in more frequent biting after having been in mixed strain groups compared to pure strain groups. This was true of groups mixed as juveniles, as well as adults, indicating that this response was not dependent on exposure during a critical developmental period. Also, TM1 fish (but not Nadia) having recently been housed in mixed-strain groups were more willing to leave the immediate vicinity of a shoal than were TM1 fish raised in pure strain groups. This change was more pronounced in groups mixed as juveniles than as adults. In addition, the observed changes persisted after mixed groups were separated into pure strain groups for a month. Other behavioral measures including Activity Level, Predator Response and Stress Recovery were unaffected by previous social experience. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibition and altered locomotor behavior in the carabid beetle Pterostichus cupreus. A linkage between biomarkers at two levels of biological complexity
AB  - The establishment of cause-effect relationships is fundamental for the interpretation and the predictive value of biomarker responses measured at all levels of biological complexity. In the present study, the biochemical exposure biomarker acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) inhibition was related to locomotor behavior, representing a general effect biomarker at the organismal level. Both sexes of the carabid beetle Pterostichus cupreus were intoxicated with three doses of the organophosphorous insecticide dimethoate. Five elements of their locomotor behavior were measured for 4 h employing computer-aided video tracking, whereupon the whole body AChE activity was measured in the individual beetle. AChE inhibition was strongly correlated with dimethoate dose in both sexes. Alterations in the locomotor behavior were directly correlated with AChE inhibition in male beetles, which responded by reducing the time in locomotion, average velocity, and path length and by increasing the turning rate and frequency of stops. Females responded similarly at the two highest doses, whereas their locomotor behavior was not significantly different from the control group at the lowest dimethoate dose, suggesting a sex-dependent difference in behavioral sensitivity to minor AChE depressions. The results demonstrate that automated measurements of locomotor behavior is at least as sensitive an endpoint to organophosphate poisoning as the AChE assay. Further, the correlation between the molecular and behavioral responses in individual beetles indicates a mechanistic relationship between the two biomarkers.

TI  - Pesticide and trace metal occurrence and aquatic benchmark exceedances in surface waters and sediments of urban wetlands and retention ponds in Melbourne, Australia
AB  - Samples of water and sediments were collected from 24 urban wetlands in Melbourne, Australia, in April 2010, and tested for more than 90 pesticides using a range of gas chromatographic (GC) and liquid chromatographic (LC) techniques, sample ‘hormonal’ activity using yeast-based recombinant receptor-reporter gene bioassays, and trace metals using spectroscopic techniques. At the time of sampling, there was almost no estrogenic activity in the water column. Twenty-three different pesticide residues were observed in one or more water samples from the 24 wetlands; chemicals observed at more than 40 % of sites were simazine (100 %), atrazine (79 %), and metalaxyl and terbutryn (46 %). Using the toxicity unit (TU) concept, less than 15 % of the detected pesticides were considered to pose an individual, short-term risk to fish or zooplankton in the ponds and wetlands. However, one pesticide (fenvalerate) may have posed a possible short-term risk to fish (log10TUf &gt; −3), and three pesticides (azoxystrobin, fenamiphos and fenvalerate) may have posed a risk to zooplankton (logTUzp between −2 and −3); all the photosystem II (PSII) inhibiting herbicides may have posed a risk to primary producers in the ponds and wetlands (log10TUap and/or log10TUalg &gt; -3). The wetland sediments were contaminated with 16 different pesticides; no chemicals were observed at more than one third of sites, but based on frequency of detection and concentrations, bifenthrin (33 %, maximum 59 μg/kg) is the priority insecticide of concern for the sediments studied. Five sites returned a TU greater than the possible effect threshold (i.e. log10TU &gt; 1) as a result of bifenthrin contamination of their sediments. Most sediments did not exceed Australian sediment quality guideline levels for trace metals. However, more than half of the sites had threshold effect concentration quotients (TECQ) values &gt;1 for Cu (58 %), Pb (50 %), Ni (67 %) and Zn (63 %), and 75 % of sites had mean probable effect concentration quotients (PECQ) &gt;0.2, suggesting that the collected sediments may have been having some impact on sediment-dwelling organisms. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - The effect of sex and shoal size on shoaling behaviour in Danio rerio
AB  - Male and female zebra fish Danio rerio were given choices of shoals that differed in sex and size. Male zebra fish preferred to associate with female shoals over male shoals, but had no preference when given a choice between a mixed-sex shoal and either a male or female shoal. Female zebra fish showed no significant preference when given a choice between male and females shoals, nor between mixed-sex shoals and either male or female shoals. When given choices between shoals of differing size, females preferred to associate with the larger shoal, whether or not they were composed of males or females. Males, however, had no preference for larger shoals over smaller shoals, whether or not they were composed of males or females. These results showed that male zebra fish were capable of distinguishing between males and females solely on the basis of visual cues. Furthermore, these results demonstrated a significant difference between the shoaling choices of male and female zebra fish, which may indicate a difference in the function of shoaling for the two sexes. © The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, 2005.

TI  - Early expression of acetylcholinesterase activity in functionally distinct neurons of the zebrafish
AB  - The first expression and distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was studied among a distinct population of early neurons in embryonic zebrafish by using histochemical and retrograde labeling techniques. AChE first appeared in the nervous system in the primary motoneurons of the rostral spinal cord when the embryo had nine somites, approximately 14 hours postfertilization. Subsequent expression of AChE activity in the spinal cord proceeded in a rostral‐to‐caudal sequence. Cranial neurons expressed AChE activity shortly after it appeared in the rostral spinal cord. Several hours later, near the end of the first day, primary neurons in the hindbrain and spinal cord all contained AChE, including sensory neurons, reticulospinal interneurons, and primary motoneurons. AChE activity was also detected in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Presumptive cranial ganglia transiently expressed AChE activity between 14 and 24 hours of development. These results, combined with previous observations that examined the time of origin and axogenesis of primary neurons, suggest that primary neurons in the embryonic zebrafish contain AChE before they sprout axons. The primary neurons appear to follow a common sequence of development consisting of a withdrawal from the cell division cycle, the expression of AChE, and axogenesis. Although this sequence is followed by all primary neurons, lack of a rostral‐to‐caudal sequence in the time of birth and variability in the time of axon outgrowth demonstrate that the relative timing of these three events is not rigidly programmed in individual neurons. Moreover, the very early expression of AChE in such diverse cell types suggests that it may have a developmental role in addition to its function in transmitter metabolism. Copyright © 1989 Alan R.

TI  - Antioxidant enzymes as redox-based biomarkers: A brief review
AB  - The field of redox proteomics focuses to a large extent on analyzing cysteine oxidation in proteins under different experimental conditions and states of diseases. The identification and localization of oxidized cysteines within the cellular milieu is critical for understanding the redox regulation of proteins under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and it will in turn provide important information that are potentially useful for the development of novel strategies in the treatment and prevention of diseases associated with oxidative stress. Antioxidant enzymes that catalyze oxidation/reduction processes are able to serve as redox biomarkers in various human diseases, and they are key regulators controlling the redox state of functional proteins. Redox regulators with antioxidant properties related to active mediators, cellular organelles, and the surrounding environments are all connected within a network and are involved in diseases related to redox imbalance including cancer, ischemia/reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative diseases, as well as normal aging. In this review, we will briefly look at the selected aspects of oxidative thiol modification in antioxidant enzymes and thiol oxidation in proteins affected by redox control of antioxidant enzymes and their relation to disease. © 2015 by the The Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

TI  - Immunotoxicity of bisphenol S and F are similar to that of bisphenol A during zebrafish early development
AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) have been increasingly used as alternatives to bisphenol A (BPA) owing to health concerns. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of these two BPA analogs on oxidative stress and the immune system during zebrafish embryonic and larval development. Environmentally relevant levels of BPS and BPF exposure could increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, nitric oxide (NO) content, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, and the expression of immunity-related genes in concentration dependent manners during the early developmental stages in zebrafish. At a concentration of 100 μg/L, BPS and BPF showed similar effects on the immune toxicity of zebrafish as that of BPA. Moreover, BPS and BPF induced both erα and nf-κb expression, and antagonists of estrogen receptor and NF-κB blocked the effects on immunity-related gene expression, providing evidence that the two pathways mediate the actions of BPS and BPF on fish immune response and functions. Thus we conclude that the presence of BPS and BPF in the environment, similar to BPA, may also pose risks to ecosystem and human health and cannot be widely used without limitations and precautions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Joint toxicity of permethrin and cypermethrin at sublethal concentrations to the embryo-larval zebrafish
AB  - Pyrethroids, the widely used pesticides, are highly toxic to aquatic organisms. However, little information is so far available regarding the joint toxicity of type I and type II pyrethroids to fish. Zebrafish is a well-accepted aquatic vertebrate model for toxicity assessment due to small size, easy husbandry, high fecundity and transparent embryos. In this study, we utilized embryo-larval zebrafish to elucidate the combined effects of sublethal concentrations of permethrin (PM) and cypermethrin (CP), which are the most frequently used type I and type II pyrethroids, respectively. Fish were exposed from 3h postfertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf to binary mixtures of nominal concentrations of 100, 200, 300μgL-1 PM (PM100, PM200, PM300) and 10, 20, 30μgL-1 CP (CP10, CP20, CP30). Analytical data of the real concentrations of the chemicals showed a significant degradation of the pyrethroids but an obvious recovery after the renewal of the exposure solution. Defect rates of embryos exposed to these low concentrations of single PM or CP exhibited no statistically significant difference from the control, while the application of combination of PM and CP resulted in deleterious effects on zebrafish embryonic development. In all PM200 and PM300 exposure groups, increasing CP concentrations acted additively to the action of PM in terms of all sublethal endpoints. Co-treatment of embryos with the specific sodium channel blocker MS-222 and pyrethroids (individuals or the mixture) caused a decline in the incidences of body axis curvature and spasms compared to treatment of animals with pyrethroids alone, suggesting that the developmental toxicity of PM and CP to zebrafish was related to disruption of ion channels. We further revealed that mixture of the two pyrethroids caused greater down-regulation in the mRNA levels of proneural genes. The individual pesticides had no effect on the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), while the mixture exposure caused significant induction. Treatment with CP or the mixture increased the activity of catalase (CAT). Taken together, our data indicated that the mixture of PM and CP caused higher incidence of morphological defects, greater inhibition in proneural gene expression and more oxidative stress, compared to the single chemical at the corresponding doses. Our findings suggest that the combination of type I and type II pyrethroids poses a greater risk to fish in the water column. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Developmental neurotoxicity of succeeding generations of insecticides
AB  - Insecticides are by design toxic. They must be toxic to effectively kill target species of insects. Unfortunately, they also have off-target toxic effects that can harm other species, including humans. Developmental neurotoxicity is one of the most prominent off-target toxic risks of insecticides. Over the past seven decades several classes of insecticides have been developed, each with their own mechanisms of effect and toxic side effects. This review covers the developmental neurotoxicity of the succeeding generations of insecticides including organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates and neonicotinoids. The goal of new insecticide development is to more effectively kill target species with fewer toxic side effects on non-target species. From the experience with the developmental neurotoxicity caused by the generations of insecticides developed in the past advice is offered how to proceed with future insecticide development to decrease neurotoxic risk. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Where Is Dopamine and how do Immune Cells See it?: Dopamine-Mediated Immune Cell Function in Health and Disease
AB  - Dopamine is well recognized as a neurotransmitter in the brain, and regulates critical functions in a variety of peripheral systems. Growing research has also shown that dopamine acts as an important regulator of immune function. Many immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopamine related proteins, enabling them to actively respond to dopamine and suggesting that dopaminergic immunoregulation is an important part of proper immune function. A detailed understanding of the physiological concentrations of dopamine in specific regions of the human body, particularly in peripheral systems, is critical to the development of hypotheses and experiments examining the effects of physiologically relevant dopamine concentrations on immune cells. Unfortunately, the dopamine concentrations to which these immune cells would be exposed in different anatomical regions are not clear. To address this issue, this comprehensive review details the current information regarding concentrations of dopamine found in both the central nervous system and in many regions of the periphery. In addition, we discuss the immune cells present in each region, and how these could interact with dopamine in each compartment described. Finally, the review briefly addresses how changes in these dopamine concentrations could influence immune cell dysfunction in several disease states including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as the collection of pathologies, cognitive and motor symptoms associated with HIV infection in the central nervous system, known as NeuroHIV. These data will improve our understanding of the interactions between the dopaminergic and immune systems during both homeostatic function and in disease, clarify the effects of existing dopaminergic drugs and promote the creation of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulating immune function through dopaminergic signaling.

TI  - Occurrence and partitioning of endocrine-disrupting compounds in the marine environment of Thermaikos Gulf, Northern Aegean Sea, Greece
AB  - An integrated study was conducted to determine the presence of phenolic and steroid endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), in the marine environment of Thermaikos Gulf, Northern Aegean Sea, Greece. Seawater, suspended particulate matter, sediments and biota were examined for nonylphenol, octylphenol, their mono- and diethoxylate oligomers, bisphenol A, estrone, 17α-estradiol, 17β-estradiol, estriol, mestranol and 17 α -ethynylestradiol. Phenolic compounds were detected in all of the compartments, with nonylphenol and its ethoxylates being the dominant pollutants. The occurrence of nonylphenol in sediments presents a significant risk to the biota. Mussels exhibited relatively low concentrations and low bioconcentration factors for NP and OP. The effect of terrestrial sources of the EDCs on the marine environment is discussed. The influence of suspended particulate matter and organic carbon in the partition of the EDCs between the dissolved and the particulate phase was investigated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles alter hatching and larval locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP) are extensively used in various consumer products such as sunscreens and cosmetics, with high potential of being released into aquatic environments. In this study, fertilized zebrafish (Danio rerio) eggs were exposed to various concentrations of ZnO NP suspensions (control, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10. mg/L) or their respective centrifuged supernatants (0.03, 0.01, 0.08, 0.17, 0.75, and 1.21. mg/L dissolved Zn ions measured) until reaching free swimming stage. Exposure to ZnO NP suspensions and their respective centrifuged supernatants caused similar hatching delay, but did not cause larval mortality or malformation. Larval activity level, mean velocity, and maximum velocity were altered in the groups exposed to high concentrations of ZnO NP (5-10. mg/L) but not in the larvae exposed to the supernatants. To evaluate possible mechanism of observed effects caused by ZnO NP, we also manipulated the antioxidant environment by co-exposure to an antioxidant compound (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) or an antioxidant molecule suppressor (buthionine sulfoximine, BSO) with 5. mg/L ZnO NP. Co-exposure to NAC did not alter the effects of ZnO NP on hatchability, but co-exposure to BSO caused further hatching delay. For larval locomotor activity, co-exposure to NAC rescued the behavioral effect caused by ZnO NP, but co-exposure to BSO did not exacerbate the effect. Our data indicated that toxicity of ZnO NP cannot be solely explained by dissolved Zn ions, and oxidative stress may involve in ZnO NP toxicity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Zebrafish acetylcholinesterase is encoded by a single gene localized on linkage group 7. Gene structure and polymorphism; molecular forms and expression pattern during development
AB  - We cloned and sequenced the acetylcholinesterase gene and cDNA of zebrafish, Danio rerio. We found a single gene (ache) located on linkage group LG7. The relative organization of ache, eng2, and shh genes is conserved between zebrafish and mammals and defines a synteny. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was allowed to identify several allelic variations. We also identified two transposable elements in non-coding regions of the gene. Compared with other vertebrate acetylcholinesterase genes, ache gene contains no alternative splicing at 5′ or 3′ ends where only a T exon is present. The translated sequence is 60-80% identical to acetylcholinesterases of the vertebrates and exhibits an extra loop specific to teleosts. Analysis of molecular forms showed a transition, at the time of hatching, from the globular G4 form to asymmetric A12 form that becomes prominent in adults. In situ hybridization and enzymatic activity detection on whole embryos confirmed early expression of the acetylcholinesterase gene in nervous and muscular tissues. We found no butyrylcholinesterase gene or activity in Danio. These findings make zebrafish a promising model to study function of acetylcholinesterase during development and regulation of molecular forms assembly in vivo.

TI  - Effects of nicotine and alcohol on zebrafish (danio rerio) shoaling
AB  - The zebrafish has been used in the analysis of the effects of drugs of abuse, including alcohol and nicotine. In the current study, we investigate the effects of these drugs on shoaling, group-forming behavior, in zebrafish, using a newly developed set of behavioral measures. We expose our fish acutely to 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00% (% v/v) ethyl alcohol or 4 or 8. mg/L nicotine by immersing the fish in the corresponding solutions. The behavior of the exposed fish is compared to controls in a large (91. cm diameter) circular tank in which shoals of 8 subjects under the same treatment are allowed to swim freely. Several measures of shoaling are quantified including the nearest neighbour distance (NND), inter-individual distance (IID), swimming speed, polarization (a measure of the directional synchronization of the shoal), and the number and duration of excursions (departures from the shoal). Alcohol and nicotine were both found to exert significant effects on shoaling but impaired the behavior in different ways. For example, alcohol strongly disrupted polarization and only modestly reduced shoal cohesion, while nicotine had only a modest effect on polarization but robustly decreased shoal cohesion. Neither drug affected the number or the duration of excursions, but both reduced swimming speed. These results underscore the notion that using multiple measures of social behavior may allow one to characterize and distinguish different aspects of drug effects on behavior, which may facilitate discovery of novel drugs in drug screens and may also be utilized in the analysis of underlying mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Bisphenol A affects axonal growth, musculature and motor behavior in developing zebrafish
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous contaminant in environment and human body. The reproductive and developmental effects of BPA exposure in aquatic and laboratory animals have been extensively studied. However, BPA exposure on the nervous system and motor behavior development are not well understood. In this study, we utilized zebrafish embryo as a model system to investigate the effect of developmental BPA exposure on larval teratology, motor behaviors, axonal growth of spinal motoneurons and muscle structure at various developmental stages. Our findings revealed that BPA exposure altered spontaneous movement, significantly decreased touch response and swimming speed in response to light stimulation in developing zebrafish. These effects were observed at the concentrations that did not yield any significant teratogenic effects. Correlated with those changes in swimming activity, BPA-induced axial muscle damage occurred at the same concentration range (1-15. μM), but disruption of axonal growth of primary and secondary motoneuron occurred only at higher concentration (15. μM). BPA-induced apoptotic cell death subsequent to initial ROS formation and oxidative DNA damage may be the underlying mechanism for axial muscle damage, suggesting the functional relevance of muscle structural changes and the observed deficits in swimming activity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute developmental neurotoxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in zebrafish larvae. From 2 to 120h postfertilization zebrafish embryos were exposed to DE-71 (0, 31.0, 68.7, and 227.6μg/L). The authors studied the locomotor behavior of larvae, involvement of the cholinergic system, and selected gene and protein expressions in the central nervous system. The results showed that low DE-71 concentration caused hyperactivity, whereas higher concentrations decreased activity during the dark period. During the light period, larval activity was significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. In the cholinergic system, acetylcholinesterase activity significantly increased (10.7 and 12.4%) in the 68.7 and 227.6μg/L exposure groups, respectively, and acetylcholine concentration accordingly decreased (60.5%) in the 227.6μg/L exposure group. The mRNA expressions of genes encoding myelin basic protein, neuron microtubule protein (α1-tubulin), and sonic hedgehog a were significantly downregulated. Western blotting assay demonstrated that the protein concentration of α1-tubulin was also decreased. Overall, the present study demonstrated that acute exposure to PBDEs can disrupt the neurobehavior of zebrafish larvae and affect cholinergic neurotransmission and neuron development. © 2012 SETAC.

TI  - Evaluation of apoptosis, oxidative stress responses, AChE activity and body malformations in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to deltamethrin
AB  - In this study, we observed the zebrafish embryo/larvae (Danio rerio) exposed to Deltamethrin (DM) used as pesticide in agricultural fields. We determined respectively, changes in body morphology, cell apoptosis, antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT, GPx) activities, MDA and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels after 96h of DM exposure. The embryos were exposed to 2.5 μg/l - 10 μg/l - 25 μg/l - 50 μg/l of DM concentration for 96 h. Survival and hatching rates, and body malformations were determined under a stereo microscope for in 24, 48, 72 and 96th hours. DM caused the cellular apoptosis and an increase in MDA levels while inhibiting SOD, CAT, GPx enzyme activities and AChE level (P < 0.05). In addition, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, spinal cord curvature and body malformations were determined in the embryo by depending on the dose of pesticide. As conclusion it can be concluded that DM inhibits the antioxidant enzyme mechanism, increases the cellular apoptosis, malformations. This study may provide enable us for understanding toxic mechanisms of DM in zebrafish embryos. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Analysis of emerging organic contaminants in water, fish and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Joint Danube Survey using solid-phase extraction followed by UHPLC-MS-MS and GC–MS analysis
AB  - In the third Joint Danube Survey (JDS3), emerging organic contaminants were analysed in the dissolved water phase of samples from the Danube River and its major tributaries. Analyses were performed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The polar organic compounds analysed by UHPLC-MS-MS were 1H-benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazoles, carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethox-azole, 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid), metolachlor, cybutryne (irgarol), terbutryn, DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), and several perfluoroalkyl acids (C6–C9; C8 = perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) and perfluorooctansulfonic acid (PFOS). In addition, several organophosphorus flame retardants were analysed by GC-MS. The most relevant compounds identified in the 71 water samples, in terms of highest median and maximum concentrations, were 1H-benzotriazole, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP), methylbenzotriazoles, carbama-zepine and its metabolite, DEET, sulfamethoxazole, tris(isobutyl)phosphate (TiBP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), PFOA, PFOS and diclofenac. The concentrations of these compounds in the samples were generally below the environmental quality standard (EQS) threshold values, with the exception of PFOS, the concentration of which exceeded the annual average water EQS limit of 0.65 ng/L along the whole river, and also exceeded the fish biota EQS of 9.1 μg/kg. In addition, the proposed EQS for diclofenac, of 0.1 μg/L, was exceeded in the Arges River in Romania (255 ng/L). © 2017 The Author(s)

TI  - Oxidative injury caused by individual and combined exposure of neonicotinoid, organophosphate and herbicide in zebrafish
AB  - The greatest challenge in environmental toxicology is to understand the effects of mixture toxicity as environmental pollutants co-exist and exhibit combined effects. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the mixture toxicity associated with two or more co-existing compounds. Pesticides are widely used to control pest, they are ubiquitous in nature and present in all environmental components. Pesticide residue can be detected in almost all components of environment and food samples. Imidacloprid (IMD) (neonicotinoid), dichlorvos (DIC) (organophosphate) and atrazine (ATZ) are three widely used pesticides for commercial uses. Present work includes the assessment of effects of individual exposure of IMD (27.5 mg/L), DIC (15 mg/L), and ATZ (03 mg/L) and in combination of three (CMD) (13.75 + 7.5 + 1.5 mg/L IMD, DIC & ATZ, respectively) in terms of LPO, GSH content and antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) in zebrafish (Danio rerio), exposed for 24 h. CMD group exhibits highest lipid peroxidation than other individually exposed groups. Similarly, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were highest in CMD group with reduced GSH content. Results indicate that exposure to mixture of pesticides develops synergistic effects which were more toxic in compare to individual exposure and also produce toxicity in all examined tissues rather than selective organ toxicity. © 2017

TI  - Neuro-toxic and reproductive effects of BPA
AB  - Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide. It has recognized activity as an endocrine-disrupting chemical and has suspected roles as a neurological and reproductive toxicant. It interferes in steroid signaling, induces oxidative stress, and affects gene expression epigenetically. Gestational, perinatal and neonatal exposures to BPA affect developmental processes, including brain development and gametogenesis, with consequences on brain functions, behavior, and fertility. Methods: This review critically analyzes recent findings on the neuro-toxic and reproductive effects of BPA (and its analogues), with focus on neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, glia and microglia activity, cognitive functions, and the central and local control of reproduction. Results: BPA has potential human health hazard associated with gestational, peri- and neonatal exposure. Beginning with BPA’s disposition, this review summarizes recent findings on the neurotoxicity of BPA and its analogues, on neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, neuro-degeneration, and impairment of cognitive abilities. Furthermore, it reports the recent findings on the activity of BPA along the HPG axis, effects on the hypothalamic Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), and the associated effects on reproduction in both sexes and successful pregnancy. Conclusion: BPA and its analogues impair neuronal activity, HPG axis function, reproduction, and fertility. Contrasting results have emerged in animal models and human. Thus, further studies are needed to better define their safety levels. This review offers new insights on these issues with the aim to find the “fil rouge”, if any, that characterize BPA’s mechanism of action with outcomes on neuronal function and reproduction. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Sources and environmental behaviors of Dechlorane Plus and related compounds - A review
AB  - Although Dechlorane Plus (DP) has been used as a polychlorinated flame retardant for almost half a century, its detection in the environment was not reported until 2006. The subsequent intensive research has confirmed its global ubiquity. A few reviews have presented the properties, analytical methods and environmental occurrence of DP and related compounds in the past several years. The present review emphasizes on the environmental behavior of DP isomers which is assessed by the variation of the isomer ratio of DP in various matrices. Other aspects including the analytical methods, emission sources, general environmental occurrence and bioaccumulation of DP are also summarized.In this review, three typical emission sources in the environment are categorized after introducing the measurement method of DP. The temporal-spatial distribution is then evaluated at the global scale, which provides an integrated representation of the environmental occurrence of DP and potential impact on the human health and ecosystems. The variations of DP isomer ratio in various matrices reinforce its source related distribution and their stereoselective bioaccumulation. Thereafter, DP related compounds and dechlorinated analogs are briefly summarized in regards to their occurrence in various matrices, suggesting their ubiquity in the environment and bioavailability. Further studies are required to better assess the exposures and toxicological effects of DP and its analogs. A special concern is the serious contamination in e-waste recycling areas in developing countries, where long-term monitoring data on the association of DP exposure and adverse effects to human health and ecosystems is urgently needed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effects of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) on sex-dependent alterations of thyroid hormones in adult zebrafish
AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been widely used as alternatives to polybrominated diphenyl ethers for fire prevention. OPFRs are suspected of causing potential thyroid disruption in humans. In fish, their thyroid hormone modulation is reported but the mechanisms of this modulation are less understood. Thyroid-disturbing effects of OPFRs were evaluated using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) following 14d exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) or triphenyl phosphate (TPP). Plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones were measured and transcriptions of several genes involved in thyroid function were quantified in brain, thyroid, and liver. Exposure to TDCPP or TPP led to significant decreases in plasma triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations in the male fish, while the increases were observed in the female fish. Exposure to the OPFRs also altered the transcription of regulatory genes and receptors in hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid of the fish in sex-dependent manner. In the male fish, transcriptions of corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) in the brain were significantly up-regulated, probably as a compensation for hypothyroidism, but thyroglobulin (tg) and deiodinase 2 (dio2) were down-regulated in thyroid or liver. In contrast, in the females, transcriptions of crh and tsh genes were significantly down-regulated. These observations show that TDCPP and TPP exposure can lead to sex-dependent disruptions of thyroid hormone balances in the adult zebrafish through alterations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Activation of autophagic flux against xenoestrogen bisphenol-A-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration via AMP kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways
AB  - The human health hazards related to persisting use of bisphenol-A (BPA) are well documented. BPA-induced neurotoxicity occurs with the generation of oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and cognitive dysfunctions. However, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of the effects of BPA on autophagy and association with oxidative stress and apoptosis are still elusive. We observed that BPA exposure during the early postnatal period enhanced the expression and the levels of autophagy genes/proteins. BPA treatment in the presence of bafilomycin A1 increased the levels of LC3-II and SQSTM1 and also potentiated GFP-LC3 puncta index in GFP-LC3-transfected hippocampal neural stem cell-derived neurons. BPA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were mitigated by a pharmacological activator of autophagy (rapamycin). Pharmacological (wortmannin and bafilomycin A1) and genetic (beclin siRNA) inhibition of autophagy aggravated BPA neurotoxicity. Activation of autophagy against BPA resulted in intracellular energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) activation, increased phosphorylation of raptor and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and decreased phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser-757), and silencing of AMPK exacerbated BPA neurotoxicity. Conversely, BPA exposure down-regulated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by phosphorylation of raptor as a transient cell's compensatory mechanism to preserve cellular energy pool. Moreover, silencing of mTOR enhanced autophagy, which further alleviated BPA-induced reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis. BPA-mediated neurotoxicity also resulted in mitochondrial loss, bioenergetic deficits, and increased PARKIN mitochondrial translocation, suggesting enhanced mitophagy. These results suggest implication of autophagy against BPA-mediated neurodegeneration through involvement of AMPK and mTOR pathways. Hence, autophagy, which arbitrates cell survival and demise during stress conditions, requires further assessment to be established as a biomarker of xenoestrogen exposure. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

TI  - The role of taurine on anxiety-like behaviors in zebrafish: A comparative study using the novel tank and the light-dark tasks
AB  - Taurine (TAU) is an amino sulfonic acid with several functions in central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggests that it acts in osmoregulation, neuromodulation and also as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, the effects of TAU on behavioral functions, especially on anxiety-related parameters, are limited. The adult zebrafish is a suitable model organism to examine anxiety-like behaviors since it presents neurotransmitter systems and behavioral functions evolutionary conserved. Anxiety in zebrafish can be measured by different tasks, analyzing the habituation to novelty, as well as the response to brightly lit environments. The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute TAU treatment alters anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish using the novel tank and the light-dark tests. Fish were individually treated with TAU (42, 150, and 400. mg/L) for 1. h and the behaviors were further analyzed for 6. min in the novel tank or in the light-dark test. Control fish were handled in a similar manner, but kept only in home tank water. Although TAU did not alter locomotor and vertical activities, all concentrations significantly increased shuttling and time spent in lit compartment. Moreover, TAU 150 group showed a significant decrease in the number of risk assessment episodes. Overall, these data suggest that TAU exerts an anxiolytic-like effect in zebrafish and the comparative analysis of behavior using different tasks is an interesting strategy for neuropsychiatric studies related to anxiety in this species. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Dopaminergic effects on in vitro osteogenesis
AB  - Multiple growth factors (e.g., BMP2, TGF-β1, FGF2) and isolated genes have been shown to improve osteoblastic proliferation and mineralization, advancing bone tissue engineering. Among these factors, both polydopamine (PDA) and dopamine (DA) monomer have recently been reported to increase osteoblast proliferation and mineralization in vitro. Although a well-characterized neurotransmitter, DA’s role in the bone is unknown. We hypothesize that DA can directly act on osteoblasts, and examined whether osteoblasts express DA receptors that respond to exogenous DA. mRNAs and protein cell lysates were obtained from MC3T3-E1 cells during osteogenic differentiation phase. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of DA receptors, D1–D5. Dose-response effect and time course of DA treatment on cell proliferation, mineralization, and osteogenic differentiation were investigated at pre-determined days. Real-time PCR was performed to investigate whether DA affects osteogenic gene expression (ALP, BSP, OC, OSX, RUNX2, and Collagen1a2) with or without receptor antagonists (SCH233390 and GR103691). Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. All five DA receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) mRNAs and proteins were expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. DA treatment increased cell proliferation for up to 7 days (P < 0.05). Osteogenic mineralization was significantly greater in the DA-treated group than control group (P < 0.05). Finally, expression of all the osteogenic genes was inhibited by DA receptor antagonists for D1, D3, and D5. Our findings suggest that MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts express functional DA receptors that enhance proliferation and mineralization. PDA is not biologically inert and has important implications in orthopedic applications. Furthermore, osteoblast differentiation might be regulated by the nervous system, presumably during bone development, remodeling, or repair. © 2015 Sichuan University All rights reserved.

TI  - Toxicity of dyes to zebrafish at the biochemical level: Cellular energy allocation and neurotoxicity
AB  - Dyes are widely distributed worldwide, and can be found in wastewaters resulting from industrial or urban effluents. Dyes are of particular concern as contaminants of the aquatic environment, since their toxicity remain poorly understood. Thus, the current study was designed to assess the effects induced by the synthetic azo dye Basic Red 51 (BR51) and by the natural naphthoquinone dye erythrostominone (ERY) on zebrafish early life stages (Danio rerio) at different biological organization levels, i.e., studying how changes in biochemical parameters of important physiological functions (neurotransmission and cellular energy allocation) may be associated with behavior alterations (swimming activity). This approach was also used to assess the effects of ERY after its photodegradation resulting in a colorless product(s) (DERY). Results showed that after 96 h exposure to BR51 and Ery, zebrafish embryos consumed less energy (LOEC = 7.5 mg/L), despite the unaltered levels of available energy (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins). Hence, cellular energy allocation (CEA) was significantly increased. On the other hand, only ERY decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity (LOEC = 15 mg/L). Despite that, zebrafish larvae exposed to both dyes until 144 h were less active. In contrast, DERY did not affect any parameter measured. These results indicate an association between a decrease consumption of energy and decrease swimming activity resulting from an environmental stress condition, independently of the neurotoxicity of the dyes. Degradation of ERY by light prevented all toxic effects previously observed, suggesting a cheap, fast and easy alternative treatment of effluents containing this natural dye. All tools assessed in our current study were sensitive as early-warning endpoints of dyes toxicity on zebrafish early life stages, and suggest that the CEA assay might be useful to predict effects on locomotor activity when cholinergic damage is absent. Energy balance is associated with locomotor activity of zebrafish early life stages: dyes decreased the energy consumption, compromising energy allocation to swimming activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Zebrafish as a model for epilepsy-induced cognitive dysfunction: A pharmacological, biochemical and behavioral approach
AB  - Epilepsy is a neuronal disorder allied with distinct neurological and behavioral alterations characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. Impairment of the cognitive performances such as learning and memory is frequently observed in epileptic patients. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are efficient to the majority of patients. However, 30% of this population seems to be refractory to the drug treatment. These patients are not seizure-free and frequently they show impaired cognitive functions. Unfortunately, as a side effect, some AEDs could contribute to such impairment. The major problem associated with conducting studies on epilepsy-related cognitive function is the lack of easy, rapid, specific and sensitive in vivo testing models. However, by using a number of different techniques and parameters in the zebrafish, we can incorporate the unique feature of specific disorder to study the molecular and behavior basis of this disease. In the view of current literature, the goal of the study was to develop a zebrafish model of epilepsy induced cognitive dysfunction. In this study, the effect of AEDs on locomotor activity and seizure-like behavior was tested against the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced seizures in zebrafish and epilepsy associated cognitive dysfunction was determined using T-maze test followed by neurotransmitter estimation and gene expression analysis. It was observed that all the AEDs significantly reversed PTZ induced seizure in zebrafish, but had a negative impact on cognitive functions of zebrafish. AEDs were found to modulate neurotransmitter levels, especially GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine and gene expression in the drug treated zebrafish brains. Therefore, combination of behavioral, neurochemical and genenetic information, makes this model a useful tool for future research and discovery of newer and safer AEDs. © 2017 Kundap, Kumari, Othman and Shaikh.

TI  - Partitioning of endocrine disrupting compounds in inland waters and wastewaters discharged into the coastal area of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece
AB  - Background, aim, and scope: In the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, environmental objectives for the proper quality of inland, surface, transitional, coastal, and ground waters have been set. Member states are required to identify chemical pollutants of significance in the water bodies, to establish emission control measures, and to achieve quality standards. A specific category of pollutants are the compounds that may possess endocrine-related functions known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). This means that member states have the obligation to take action in order to prevent human exposure to these compounds via aquatic environment. The objective of this research was to study the occurrence and distribution of phenolic and steroid EDCs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged in the area of Thermaikos Gulf, Thessaloniki, Northern Greece. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from three rivers, four streams, and four municipal and industrial wastewaters from the area of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece, during the period 2005-2006. The samples were analyzed for 14 EDCs (nonylphenol, octylphenol, their mono- and di-ethoxylate oligomers, bisphenol A, estrone, 17α-estradiol, 17β-estradiol, estriol, mestranol, and 17α-ethynylestradiol). The compounds were recovered by solid phase extraction and ultrasonic extraction from the dissolved phase and particulate phase, respectively, and determined by employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Results revealed the presence of phenolic EDCs (NP, NP1EO, NP2EO, tOP, OP1EO, OP2EO, and BPA) in all water and wastewater samples. Steroid EDCs were not found at detectable concentrations. The relationships between field partition coefficients of EDCs and concentration of total suspended solids, dissolved, and particulate organic carbon were investigated. Discussion: Rivers exhibited concentrations of EDCs similar to minimally impacted surface waters worldwide. The concentrations of NP and OP occasionally exceeded the environmental quality criteria proposed for inland waters. The concentrations of EDCs in streams exhibited wide variations due to low flow rate in these systems and the impact of wastewaters from various pollution sources. Wastewater from tannery activities showed extremely high concentrations of NP, whereas relatively high concentrations of EDCs were determined in effluents from the industrial wastewater treatment plant. Field partition coefficients of EDCs are negatively correlated with concentrations of total suspended solids and dissolved organic carbon and positively correlated with particulate organic carbon. Conclusions: The examined rivers (Aliakmon, Axios, and Loudias) exhibited concentrations of EDCs similar to minimally impacted surface waters worldwide. However, special attention should be paid to these systems since the concentrations for NP and OP occasionally were above the proposed quality standards, revealing the impact of urban, industrial, and agricultural activities. High concentrations of EDCs were determined in streams, urban, and industrial wastewater posing significant risk to the aquatic environment they discharged. Recommendations and perspectives: The occurrence of EDCs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged to Thermaikos Gulf results in an increased risk to the marine environment. Thus, these systems should be regularly monitored, especially for NP, OP, and BPA that are considered as priority hazardous compounds in the Water Framework Directive. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

TI  - Behavioural toxicity assessment of silver ions and nanoparticles on zebrafish using a locomotion profiling approach
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is not only a widely used species in the Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test but also an emerging model in behavioural ecotoxicology. By using automatic behaviour tracking technology, locomotion of developing zebrafish (ZF) larvae can be accurately recorded and potentially used in an ecotoxicological context to detect toxicant-induced behavioural alterations. In this study, we explored if and how quantitative locomotion data can be used for sub-lethal toxicity testing within the FET framework. We exposed ZF embryos to silver ions and nanoparticles, which previously have been reported to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity and behavioural retardation in early-life stages of ZF. Exposure to a broad range of silver (Ag+ and AgNPs) concentrations was conducted, and developmental toxicity was assessed using FET criteria. For behavioural toxicity assessment, locomotion of exposed ZF eleutheroembryos (120 hpf) was quantified according to a customised behavioural assay in an automatic video tracking system. A set of repeated episodes of dark/light stimulation were used to artificially stress ZF and evoke photo-motor responses, which were consequently utilized for locomotion profiling. Our locomotion-based behaviour profiling approach consisted of (1) dose-response ranking for multiple and single locomotion variables; (2) quantitative assessment of locomotion structure; and (3) analysis of ZF responsiveness to darkness stimulation. We documented that both silver forms caused adverse effects on development and inhibited hatchability and, most importantly, altered locomotion. High Ag+ and AgNPs exposures significantly suppressed locomotion and a clear shift in locomotion towards inactivity was reported. Additionally, we noted that low, environmentally relevant Ag+ concentrations may cause subordinate locomotive changes (hyperactivity) in developing fish. Overall, it was concluded that our locomotion-based behaviour-testing scheme can be used jointly with FET and can provide endpoints for sub-lethal toxicity. When combined with multivariate data analysis, this approach facilitated new insights for handling and analysis of data generated by automatized behavioural tracking systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Directional and color preference in adult zebrafish: Implications in behavioral and learning assays in neurotoxicology studies
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a useful vertebrate model organism for neurological studies. While a number of behavior and learning assays are recently reported in the literature for zebrafish, many of these assays are still being refined. The initial purpose of this study was to apply a published T-maze assay for adult zebrafish that measures how quickly an organism can discriminate between different color stimuli after receiving reinforcement to measure learning in a study investigating the later life impacts of developmental Pb exposure. The original results were inconclusive as the control group showed a directional and color preference. To assess directional preference further, a three-chambered testing apparatus was constructed and rotated in several directions. The directional preference observed in males was alleviated by rotating the arms pointing west and east. In addition, color preference was investigated using all combinations of five different colors (orange, yellow, green, blue and purple). With directional preference alleviated results showed that both male and female zebrafish preferred colors of shorter wavelengths. An additional experiment tested changes in color preference due to developmental exposure to Pb in adult male zebrafish. Results revealed that Pb-exposed males gained and lost certain color preferences compared to control males and the preference for short wavelengths was decreased. Overall, these results show that consideration and pretesting should be completed before applying behavioral and learning assays involving adult zebrafish to avoid innate preferences and confounding changes in neurotoxicology studies and that developmental Pb exposure alters color preferences in adult male zebrafish. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Effects of chronic exposure to nonylphenol on locomotor activity and social behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Nonylphenol (NP), a xenoestrogen ubiquitously found in aquatic ecosystems, is of high environmental concern. The present work assessed the effects of exposure to NP on locomotor activity and social behavior in male and female zebrafish (Danio rerio), to evaluate the possible hazard of NP to fish behavior and to pursue a potential biomarker of NP contamination. Fish were randomly divided into six groups. Five groups were receiving 0.1, 1, 10, 50 and 100 μg/L nominal concentrations of NP for 60 days, respectively. A sixth control group was given the same treatment as the other five groups, but no NP. Locomotor activity, aggressive behavior, group preference and leaving shoal were examined. NP exposure showed marked influence on locomotor activity of the male zebrafish, whereas that of the female was not significantly affected by NP. Aggressive behavior and group preference were significantly affected by NP exposure in both male and female groups. Locomotor activity and aggressive behavior of the male and group preference of both male and female zebrafish were clearly inhibited at 100 μg/L NP. No significant alteration in leaving shoal was observed under NP exposure. The results suggested that changes in locomotor activity and aggressive behavior of the male and group preference of both male and female may be used as an ecologically relevant integrative biomarker of NP contamination. © 2010 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Carbendazim has the potential to induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, immunotoxicity and endocrine disruption during zebrafish larvae development
AB  - Increasing evidence have suggested deleterious effects of carbendazim on reproduction, apoptosis, immunotoxicity and endocrine disruption in mice and rats, however, the developmental toxicity of carbendazim to aquatic organisms remains obscure. In the present study, we utilized zebrafish as an environmental monitoring model to characterize the effects of carbendazim on expression of genes related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, immunotoxicity and endocrine disruption during larval development. Different trends in gene expression were observed upon exposing the larvae to 4, 20, 100, and 500 μg/L carbendazim for 4 and 8 d. The mRNA levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and manganese superoxide dismutase (CAT, GPX, and Mn/SOD) were up-regulated after exposure to different concentrations of carbendazim for 4 or 8 d. The up-regulation of p53, Apaf1, Cas8 and the down-regulation of Bcl2, Mdm2, Cas3 in the apoptosis pathway, as well as the increased expression of cytokines and chemokines, including CXCL-C1C, CCL1, IL-1b, IFN, IL-8, and TNFα, suggested carbendazim might trigger apoptosis and immune response during zebrafish larval development. In addition, the alteration of mRNA expression of VTG, ERα, ERβ1, ERβ2, TRα, TRβ, Dio1, and Dio2 indicated the potential of carbendazim to induce endocrine disruption in zebrafish larvae. These data suggested that carbendazim could simultaneously induce multiple responses during zebrafish larval development, and bidirectional interactions among oxidative stress, apoptosis pathway, immune and endocrine systems might be present. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Toxicity assessment of combined fluoroquinolone and tetracycline exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Fluoroquinolones (FQs) and tetracyclines (TCs), the two β-diketone antibiotics (DKAs), are two frequently detected pollutants in the environment; however, little data are available on their combined toxicity to zebrafish (Danio rerio). This study reports that toxicologic effects of combined DKA (FQs-TCs) exposure on zebrafish were comparable with or slightly less than those of TCs alone, showing that TCs played a major toxicologic role in the mixtures. The effects of FQs, TCs, and DKAs on malformation rates of zebrafish were dose dependent, with EC50 values of 481.3, 16.4, and 135.1 mg/L, respectively. According to the combined effects of DKAs on zebrafish hatching, mortality, and malformation rates, the interaction between FQs and TCs was shown to be antagonistic based on three assessment methods: Toxic Unit, Additional Index, and Mixture Toxic Index. The 1.56 mg/L TC and 9.38 mg/L DKA treatments resulted in higher zebrafish basal swimming rate compared with the control group at 120 hours postfertilization (hpf). in both light and light-to-dark photoperiod experiments. Under conditions of no obvious abnormality in cardiac development, the heart beats were decreased significantly because of DKA exposure, such as decreasing by ∼20% at 150 mg/L DKAs. Transmission electron microscopy observation of myocytes from DKA-exposed hearts displayed prominent interruptions and myofibrillar disorganization of the normal parallel alignment of thick and thin filaments, and partial edematous and dissolved membranes of cell nuclear tissues. At 90 mg/L DKAs, the transcriptional levels of the acta1a, myl7, and gle1b genes, related to heart development and skeletal muscle formation, were significantly changed. This is consistent with the swimming behavior and histopathologic results obtained by transmission electron microscopy. In summary, the toxicity of the combined DKAs to zebrafish was comparable with or less than that of TCs alone and had the ability to impair individual behaviors that are of great importance in the assessment of their ecologic fitness. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Effects of piracetam on behavior and memory in adult zebrafish
AB  - Piracetam, a derivative of γ-aminobutyric acid, exerts memory-enhancing and mild anxiolytic effects in human and rodent studies. To examine the drug's behavioral profile further, we assessed its effects on behavioral and endocrine (cortisol) responses of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) - a novel model species rapidly gaining popularity in neurobehavioral research. Overall, acute piracetam did not affect zebrafish novel tank and light-dark box behavior at mild doses (25-400. mg/L), but produced nonspecific behavioral inhibition at 700. mg/L. No effects on cortisol levels or inter-/intra-session habituation in the novel tank test were observed for acute or chronic mild non-sedative dose of 200. mg/L. In contrast, fish exposed to chronic piracetam at this dose performed significantly better in the cued learning plus-maze test. This observation parallels clinical and rodent literature on the behavioral profile of piracetam, supporting the utility of zebrafish paradigms for testing nootropic agents. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry direct injection analysis of organophosphorus flame retardants in Ontario surface water and wastewater effluent
AB  - Organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) started to be used in plastics, electronics and furnishings back in the 1960s and became popular again last decade. They are now widely present in the environment and regarded as “new” emerging organic pollutants. An effective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) direct injection analysis (DIA) method was developed to monitor OPFR levels in aquatic environment. The removal of sample extraction and concentration steps not only improved operation efficiency, but also reduced the potential contamination commonly observed during the sample preparation process before. Positive background signals from the analytical instrument were eliminated by employing a “trap” column in front of the sample injector while an ACE C18 and an ACE C18-PFP column were compared for the separation of OPFRs. Nineteen OPFR related compounds were evaluated and rapid signal drops were observed for seven of them including TOTP, TMTP, TPTP, TEHP, T35DMPP, T2iPPP and EHDP, due to their low water solubility. The other twelve compounds, TMP, TEP, TPrP, TiPP, TBP, TCEP, TCPP, TDCPP, TPP, TBEP, BDCP and BEHP, were included for the measurement of OPFRs in drinking water, surface water, ground water and wastewater effluent samples. The instrumental detection limits of these twelve OPFRs at signal-to-noise ≥3 were in the 1.5–30 ng/L range. The method was applied for the determination of OPFRs in surface water and wastewater samples in Ontario, Canada, and BEHP, TBEP, TBP, TCEP, TCPP, TDCPP, and TEP were commonly detected. © 2017

TI  - Highly Sensitive and High-Throughput Method for the Analysis of Bisphenol Analogues and Their Halogenated Derivatives in Breast Milk
AB  - The structural analogs of bisphenol A (BPA) and their halogenated derivatives (together termed BPs) have been found in the environment, food, and even the human body. Limited research showed that some of them exhibited toxicities that were similar to or even greater than that of BPA. Therefore, adverse health effects for BPs were expected for humans with low-dose exposure in early life. Breast milk is an excellent matrix and could reflect fetuses' and babies' exposure to contaminants. Some of the emerging BPs may present with trace or ultratrace levels in humans. However, existing analytical methods for breast milk cannot quantify these BPs simultaneously with high sensitivity using a small sampling weight, which is important for human biomonitoring studies. In this paper, a method based on Bond Elut Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid purification, pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride derivatization, and liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed. The method requires only a small quantity of sample (200 μL) and allowed for the simultaneous determination of 24 BPs in breast milk with ultrahigh sensitivity. The limits of quantitation of the proposed method were 0.001-0.200 μg L-1, which were 1-6.7 times lower than the only study for the simultaneous analysis of bisphenol analogs in breast milk based on a 3 g sample weight. The mean recoveries ranged from 86.11% to 119.05% with relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 19.5% (n = 6). Matrix effects were within 20% with RSD &lt; 10% for six different lots of samples. The proposed method was successfully applied to 20 breast milk samples. BPA, bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol AF (BPAF) were detected. BPA was still the dominant BP, followed by BPF. This is the first report describing the occurrence of BPF and BPAF in breast milk. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Quercetin, a natural product supplement, impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Quercetin is a natural product that is sold as a supplement in health food stores. While there are reported benefits for this flavonoid as a dietary supplement due to antioxidant properties, the full scope of its biological interactions has not been fully addressed. To learn more about the mechanisms of action related to quercetin, we exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to 1 and 10 μg/L quercetin for 96 h starting at 3 h post fertilization. Quercetin up to 10 μg/L did not induce significant mortality in developing fish, but did increase prevalence of an upward-curved dorsal plane in hatched larvae. To determine whether this developmental defect was potentially related to mitochondrial bioenergetics during development, we measured oxygen consumption rate in whole embryos following a 24-hour exposure to quercetin. Basal mitochondrial and ATP-linked respiration were decreased at 1 and 10 μg/L quercetin, and maximal respiration was decreased at 10 μg/L quercetin, suggesting that quercetin impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics. This is proposed to be related to the deformities observed during development. Due to the fact that ATP production was affected by quercetin, larval behaviors related to locomotion were investigated, as well as transcriptional responses of six myogenesis transcripts. Quercetin at 10 μg/L significantly reduced the swimming velocity of zebrafish larvae. The expression levels of both myostatin A (mstna) and myogenic differentiation (myoD) were also altered by quercetin. Mstna, an inhibitory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 1 μg/L quercetin exposure, while myoD, a stimulatory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 10 μg/L quercetin exposure. There were no changes in transcripts related to apoptosis (bcl2, bax, casp3, casp7), but we did observe a decrease in mRNA levels for catalase (cat) in fish exposed to each dose, supporting an oxidative stress response. Our data support the hypothesis that quercetin may affect locomotion and induce deformities in zebrafish larvae by diminishing ATP production and by altering the expression of transcripts related to muscle formation and activity. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Long-term exposure to triphenylphosphate alters hormone balance and HPG, HPI, and HPT gene expression in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - With the global decline in the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, the demand for alternative flame retardants, such as triphenylphosphate (TPP), has increased substantially. Triphenylphosphate is now detected in various environments including aquatic ecosystems worldwide. However, studies on the toxicological consequences of chronic TPP exposure on aquatic organisms are scarce. The zebrafish model was used to investigate the effects of long-term TPP exposure on the endocrine system. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 5 µg/L, 50 µg/L, or 500 µg/L TPP for 120 d, and hormonal and transcriptional responses were measured along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Exposure to TPP significantly increased plasma 17β-estradiol, but decreased 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Gene expression data support these changes. In the HPI axis, plasma cortisol and proopiomelanocortin (pomc) and mineralocorticoid receptor transcripts increased in females, but in males cortisol decreased whereas pomc increased (p < 0.05). Thyroxine and triiodothyronine increased, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (trhr2) and trh expression were affected only in females (p < 0.05). In summary, long-term exposure to TPP enhanced estrogenicity in both males and females, potentially through influencing the HPG axis, but modulated the HPI, and HPT axes differently by sex, suggesting that both genomic and nongenomic responses might be involved.

TI  - Ecotoxicity of chlorpyrifos to aquatic organisms: A review
AB  - Pesticides play an important role in promoting agricultural development, while their unreasonable use has led to environmental problems. Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a typical organophosphate pesticide, is used globally as an insecticide in agriculture. The extensive application of CPF has resulted in water contamination, and CPF has been detected in rivers, lakes, seawater, and even in rain. In the present review, CPF was selected due to its extensive use in agriculture and higher detection rate in surface waters. In this review we summarised the evidence related to CPF pollution and focused on discussing the ecotoxicity of CPF to aquatic systems and revealed the mechanism of action of CPF. The aim of this literature review was to summarise the knowledge of the toxicity to marine and freshwater organisms of CPF as well as try to select a series of sensitive biomarkers, which are suitable for ecotoxicological assessment and environmental monitoring in aquatic systems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is a potent psychedelic drug inducing euphoria and hypersociability in humans, as well as hyperactivity and anxiety in rodents. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become a widely used species in neurobehavioral research. Here, we explore the effects of a wide range (0.25-120 mg/l) of acute MDMA doses on zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Although MDMA was inactive at lower doses (0.25-10 mg/l), higher doses reduced bottom swimming and immobility (40-120 mg/l) and impaired intrasession habituation (10-120 mg/l). MDMA also elevated brain c-fos expression, collectively confirming the usage of zebrafish models for screening of hallucinogenic compounds. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TI  - Modulatory action of taurine on ethanol-induced aggressive behavior in zebrafish
AB  - Alcohol is a potent agent for eliciting aggression in vertebrates. Taurine (TAU) is an amino sulfonic acid with pleiotropic actions on brain function. It is one of the most abundant molecules present in energy drinks frequently used as mixers for alcoholic beverages. However, the combined effects of TAU and ethanol (EtOH) on behavioral parameters such as aggression are poorly understood. Considering that zebrafish is a suitable vertebrate to assess agonistic behaviors using noninvasive protocols, we investigate whether TAU modulates EtOH-induced aggression in zebrafish using the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test. Since body color can be altered by pharmacological agents and may be indicative of emotional state, we also evaluated the actions of EtOH and TAU on pigment response. Fish were acutely exposed to TAU (42, 150, and 400 mg/L), EtOH (0.25%), or cotreated with both molecules for 1 h and then placed in the test apparatus for 6 min. EtOH, TAU 42, TAU 400, TAU 42/EtOH and TAU 400/EtOH showed increased aggression, while 150 mg/L TAU only increased the latency to attack the mirror. This same concentration also prevented EtOH-induced aggression, suggesting that it antagonizes the effects of acute alcohol exposure. Representative ethograms revealed the existence of different aggressive patterns and our results were confirmed by an index used to estimate aggression in the MIA test. TAU did not alter pigment intensity, while EtOH and all cotreated groups presented a substantial increase in body color. Overall, these data show a biphasic effect of TAU on EtOH-induced aggression of zebrafish, which is not necessarily associated with changes in body color. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental monitoring and risk assessment of organophosphate pesticides in aquatic ecosystems of north-west Bangladesh
AB  - The use of organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) to protect a variety of crops has increased in Bangladesh. OPPs may contaminate surrounding aquatic environments through several routes including spray drift, surface runoff and groundwater leaching. Since it is unknown how much OPP end ups in aquatic environment in Bangladesh, the objectives of the present study were to quantify the residues of ten most commonly used OPPs in water and sediment of water bodies of north-west Bangladesh and to assess their ecological risks for aquatic organisms. The risks of the pesticides in surface water and sediment were assessed using a first-tier risk quotient (RQ) approach. The higher-tier PERPEST model was used to refine the ecological risks of pesticides when RQ indicated a potential risk. Results showed the most frequently detected pesticides that appeared in high concentrations were chlorpyrifos, diazinon and quinalphos in surface water and sediment. The highest concentration of OPPs measured in water was 9.1 μg chlorpyrifos/L (median of 1.95 μg/L), while this was 51 μg diazinon/kg dw (median of 11 μg/kg dw) for sediment. Furthermore, results showed high acute and/or chronic RQs (RQ > 1) in surface water and sediment for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, quinalphos, malathion and fenitrothion. The higher-tier PERPEST model confirmed risks of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, quinalphos and fenitrothion for aquatic insects, micro- and macro-crustaceans which were previously derived by RQ-based risk assessment for aquatic organisms. Furthermore, the results of the PERPEST model also indicated possible indirect effects of these pesticides on algae and macrophytes, community metabolism, rotifers and other macro-invertebrates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Developmental environment alters conditional aggression in Zebrafish
AB  - The developmental environment influences a wide variety of phenotypic traits in the adults of many vertebrates (i.e., developmental plasticity). In this study, we test to see if developmental environment (EDEV) interacts with the adult behavioral environment (EBEHAV) in determining behavioral phenotypes. We reared Zebrafish (Danio rerio) from eggs in either continuously hypoxic or normoxic conditions. We then tested aggression and avoidance (i.e., hiding) levels of fish from each developmental treatment in both environments. Developmental environment was a significant source of variation in avoidance behavior while the stimulus environment did not influence avoidance. Without a period of acclimation we found that EBEHAV and an EDEV X EBEHAV interaction were both significant sources of variation. However, when the fish were allowed to physiologically acclimate to the environment for 16 h, aggression level was highest for fish tested in the environment in which they developed. In that case the EDEV X E BEHAV interaction was the only significant source of variation. These results demonstrate that a more complete understanding of phenotypic response can be gained by incorporating environmental conditions across multiple time scales. © 2005 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.

TI  - Effects of inducers and inhibitors on the microsomal metabolism of styrene to styrene oxide in mice
AB  - Styrene is both hepatotoxic and pneumotoxic in mice, with non-Swiss albino (NSA) mice being more sensitive than Swiss (CD-1) mice. The toxicity of styrene is potentiated by treatment with phenobarbital, β-naphthoflavone, or pyridine. Since the toxicity of styrene is generally associated with its metabolism to styrene oxide (SO), the formation of SO by hepatic and pulmonary microsomes of NSA and CD-I mice was measured to examine correlations with toxicity. Both enantiomers of SO were quantified since the R-SO enantiomer is more toxic than the S-SO enantiomer. No strain differences in rates of styrene metabolism or enantiomeric ratio were observed in control mice or mice treated with inducers. Pyridine, an inducer of CYP2E I, increased S-SO but not R-SO formation in liver. Phenobarbital, an inducer of CYP2B, increased the production of both enantiomers. β-Naphthoflavone, an inducer of CYP1A, had no effect. None of the inducers had any effect in lung. Addition of the CYP2E1 inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate decreased the formation of both enantiomers in both tissues from control mice, whereas 5-phenyl-l-pen-tyne (an inhibitor of CYP2F2) inhibited metabolism primarily in lung. In both control and phenobarbital-treated mice, SKF525A inhibited both R-SO and S-SO in liver but only S-SO in lung. Thus there are tissue differences in metabolism and susceptibility to induction and inhibition but no strain differences in metabolism to explain differences in susceptibility to styrene-induced toxicity. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Delayed behavioral effects of early life toxicant exposures in aquatic biota
AB  - Behavioral development occurs together with the development of the nervous system. Studies on mammals indicate that exposures to some chemicals during embryonic development at concentrations that do not produce anatomical malformations may nevertheless produce behavioral deficits later in life, an example of delayed effects. There have been reports of delayed effects in aquatic organisms. Delayed behavioral effects of mercury, chlorinated and other pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some synthetic hormones in the environment have been reported in fishes and invertebrates; in some cases behavioral effects are manifested years after the exposure. Another type of delayed behavioral effect results from exposure of mature females before fertilization (maternal exposure). Even when embryos and larvae are reared in clean water, offspring may manifest abnormal behaviors following maternal exposure. The reported behavioral changes are generally deleterious and compromise the fitness of the animal in its natural environment. Delayed effects and their impacts on fitness are not considered in standard short-term embryo bioassays, which will therefore underestimate neurotoxicity. The literature in the field is scattered and has not been reviewed. The objective of this paper is to review and synthesize what is known about delayed behavioral effects in aquatic biota. © 2014 by the authors.

TI  - Developing 'integrative' zebrafish models of behavioral and metabolic disorders
AB  - Recently, the pathophysiological overlap between metabolic and mental disorders has received increased recognition. Zebrafish (. Danio rerio) are rapidly becoming a popular model organism for translational biomedical research due to their genetic tractability, low cost, quick reproductive cycle, and ease of behavioral, pharmacological or genetic manipulation. High homology to mammalian physiology and the availability of well-developed assays also make the zebrafish an attractive organism for studying human disorders. Zebrafish neurobehavioral and endocrine phenotypes show promise for the use of zebrafish in studies of stress, obesity and related behavioral and metabolic disorders. Here, we discuss the parallels between zebrafish and other model species in stress and obesity physiology, as well as outline the available zebrafish models of weight gain, metabolic deficits, feeding, stress, anxiety and related behavioral disorders. Overall, zebrafish demonstrate a strong potential for modeling human behavioral and metabolic disorders, and their comorbidity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Copper at low levels impairs memory of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) and affects swimming performance of larvae
AB  - Metal contamination at low levels is an important issue because it usually produces health and environmental effects, either positive or deleterious. Contamination of surface waters with copper (Cu) is a worldwide event, usually originated by mining, agricultural, industrial, commercial, and residential activities. Water quality criteria for Cu are variable among countries but allowed limits are generally in the μg/L range, which can disrupt several functions in the early life-stages of fish species. Behavioral and biochemical alterations after Cu exposure have also been described at concentrations close to the allowed limits. Aiming to search for the effects of Cu in the range of the allowed limits, larvae and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations of dissolved Cu (nominally: 0, 5, 9, 20 and 60 μg/L; measured: 0.4, 5.7, 7.2 16.6 and 42.3 μg/L, respectively) for 96 h. Larvae swimming and body length, and adult behavior and biochemical biomarkers (activity of glutathione-related enzymes in gills, muscle, and brain) were assessed after Cu exposure. Several effects were observed in fish exposed to 9 μg/L nominal Cu, including increased larvae swimming distance and velocity, abolishment of adult inhibitory avoidance memory, and decreased glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in gills of adult fish. At the highest Cu concentration tested (nominally: 60 μg/L), body length of larvae, spatial memory of adults, and gill GST activity were decreased. Social behavior (aggressiveness and conspecific interaction), and glutathione reductase (GR) activity were not affected in adult zebrafish. Exposure to Cu, at concentrations close to the water quality criteria for this metal in fresh water, was able to alter larvae swimming performance and to induce detrimental effects on the behavior of adult zebrafish, thus indicating the need for further studies to reevaluate the currently allowed limits for Cu in fresh water. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effects of acute dieldrin exposure on neurotransmitters and global gene transcription in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) hypothalamus
AB  - Exposure to dieldrin induces neurotoxic effects in the vertebrate CNS and disrupts reproductive processes in teleost fish. Reproductive impairment observed in fish by dieldrin is likely the result of multiple effects along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but the molecular signaling cascades are not well characterized. To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10. mg. dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227 transcripts (p<0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin. Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell processes and diseases affected by dieldrin. Using multiple bioinformatics approaches, this study demonstrates that the teleostean hypothalamus is a target for dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity and provides mechanistic evidence that dieldrin activates similar cell pathways and biological processes that are also associated with the etiology of human neurological disorders. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Occurrence of organic plastic additives in surface waters of the Rhône River (France)
AB  - We present here a comprehensive study (1-year regular sampling) on the occurrence of major families of organic plastic additives in the Rhône River surface waters. Potential sources and contaminant export are also discussed. A total of 22 dissolved phase samples were analyzed for 22 organic additives mainly used in the plastic industry, including organophosphate esters (OPEs), phthalates (PAEs) and bisphenols (BPs). Our results indicate that PAEs were the most abundant class, with concentrations ranging from 97 to 541 ng L−1, followed by OPEs (85–265 ng L−1) and BPs (4–21 ng L−1). Among PAEs, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) was the most abundant compound, whereas TCPP (Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate) and TnBP (Tri(n-butyl)phosphate) were the predominant OPEs. Bisphenol S was the only BP detected. 5–54 metric tons year−1 of dissolved organic plastic additives of emerging concern are estimated to be exported to the Gulf of Lion by the Rhône River, which is the main freshwater source of the Mediterranean Sea. Organic plastic additives were present in all water samples from the Rhône River, with concentrations of up to ∼830 ng L−1 for Σ17 compounds. Phthalates were most abundant. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Arginine Administration Decreases Cerebral Cortex Acetylcholinesterase and Serum Butyrylcholinesterase Probably by Oxidative Stress Induction
AB  - In the present study we investigated the action of vitamins E and C on the inhibition of acetyl-cholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities provoked by arginine in cerebral cortex and serum of 60-day-old rats. Animals were pretreated for 1 week with daily intraperitoneal administration of saline (control) or vitamins E (40 mg/kg) and C (100 mg/kg). Twelve hours after the last injection, animals received one injection of arginine (0.8 μM/g of body weight) or saline. Results showed that acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities were decreased in the arginine-treated rats. Furthermore, pretreatment with vitamins E and C prevented these effects. The data indicate that the reduction of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities caused by arginine was probably mediated by oxidative stress. Assuming the possibility that these effects might also occur in the human condition, our findings may be relevant to explain, at least in part, the neurological dysfunction associated with hyperargininemia and might support a novel therapeutic strategy to slow the progression of neurodegeneration in this disorder.

TI  - The developmental neurotoxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers: Effect of DE-71 on dopamine in zebrafish larvae
AB  - The potential neurotoxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is still a great concern. In the present study, the authors investigated whether exposure to PBDEs could affect the neurotransmitter system and cause developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos (2h postfertilization) were exposed to different concentrations of the PBDE mixture DE-71(0-100μg/L). The larvae were harvested at 120h postfertilization, and the impact on dopaminergic signaling was investigated. The results revealed significant reductions in content of whole-body dopamine and its metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, in DE-71-exposed larvae. The transcription of genes involved in the development of dopaminergic neurons (e.g., manf, bdnf, and nr4a2b) was significantly downregulated upon exposure to DE-71. Also, DE-71 resulted in a significant decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels in dopaminergic neurons. The expression level of tyrosine hydroxylase in forebrain neurons was assessed by whole-mount immunofluorescence, and the results further demonstrated that the tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression level was reduced in dopaminergic neurons. In addition to these molecular changes, the authors observed reduced locomotor activity in DE-71-exposed larvae. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that acute exposure to PBDEs can affect dopaminergic signaling by disrupting the synthesis and transportation of dopamine in zebrafish, thereby disrupting normal neurodevelopment. In accord with its experimental findings, the present study extends knowledge of the mechanisms governing PBDE-induced developmental neurotoxicity.

TI  - Distribution patterns of octylphenol and nonylphenol in the aquatic system at Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve, a subtropical estuarine wetland in Hong Kong
AB  - Spatial and temporal distribution of octylphenol (OP) and nonylphenol (NP) in Mai Po Marshes, a subtropical estuarine wetland in Hong Kong, were investigated. Surface water samples were collected every month from 11 sites during the period of September-December 2004. Concentrations of OP and NP ranged from 11.3 to 348 ng/L and from 29 to 2591 ng/L, respectively. The high levels of NP and OP were found in November and December than in September and October. The levels of OP and NP have no significant spatial differences except September. Total organic matter in the sediments appeared to be an important factor in controlling the fate of these compounds in the aquatic environment. © 2007 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Integrated biomarkers induced by chlorpyrifos in two different life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) for environmental risk assessment
AB  - This study was performed to understand how chlorpyrifos (CHL) affects zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and adults, by exposing this model organism to various concentrations of the insecticide. The 96-h acute toxicity test to determine the effect of CHL on adult zebrafish yielded a LC50 of 709.43 μg/L-1. Small molecular weight proteins less than 25 kDa and phospholipids were analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS/MS in order to compare expression patterns, revealing that some peaks were dramatically altered after CHL treatment. Whereas no acute toxicity was detected in the embryo toxicity test, malformation of zebrafish larvae was observed, with many individuals harboring curved spines. In an angiogenesis test on larvae of transgenic zebrafish, CHL did not have an inhibitory effect. Relative gene expression analyses using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of DNA from zebrafish embryos revealed that different subtypes of cytochrome P450 (CYP450), such as CYP1A and CYP3A, were significantly up-regulated in response to CHL at a concentration of 400 μg/L-1 compared to the control. The expression level of NR1I2, a CYP gene transcriptional regulator, UGT1a1, and MDR1 were all up-regulated in the CHL-treated embryos. Finally, the expression level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and catalase (CAT) decreased, whereas that of superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not differ significantly. Our results suggest that the up-regulation of metabolic enzymes including CYP450 and MDR1 may be involved in CHL resistance in zebrafish. © 2016.

TI  - Is acetylcholinesterase a biomarker of susceptibility in Daphnia magna (Crustacea, Cladocera) after deltamethrin exposure?
AB  - In the present study, we explored the possibility of using the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a biomarker after deltamethrin (pyrethroid insecticide) exposure with three strains of the cladoceran Daphnia magna. Four calculated time-weighted deltamethrin concentrations (20.1, 40.3, 80.6 and 161.3ngL-1) were compared against control acetylcholinesterase activity. Our results showed that after 48h of deltamethrin exposure, all treatments induced a significant decrease of AChE activities whatever the three considered strains. However, diverse responses were registered in terms of lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC: 80.6ngL-1 for strain 1 and 20.1ngL-1 for strains 2 and 3) revealing differences in sensitivity among the three tested strains of D. magna. Our results suggest that after deltamethrin exposure, the AChE activity responses can be also used as a biomarker of susceptibility (i.e., variation of strain specific response). Moreover, our results show that strain 1 is the less sensitive in terms of IC50-48h of AChE, whereas it became the most sensitive when considering the EC50-48h estimated in the standard ecotoxicity test. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Model of voluntary ethanol intake in zebrafish: Effect on behavior and hypothalamic orexigenic peptides
AB  - Recent studies in zebrafish have shown that exposure to ethanol in tank water affects various behaviors, including locomotion, anxiety and aggression, and produces changes in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. Building on these investigations, the present study had two goals: first, to develop a method for inducing voluntary ethanol intake in individual zebrafish, which can be used as a model in future studies to examine how this behavior is affected by various manipulations, and second, to characterize the effects of this ethanol intake on different behaviors and the expression of hypothalamic orexigenic peptides, galanin (GAL) and orexin (OX), which are known in rodents to stimulate consumption of ethanol and alter behaviors associated with alcohol abuse. Thus, we first developed a new model of voluntary intake of ethanol in fish by presenting this ethanol mixed with gelatin, which they readily consume. Using this model, we found that individual zebrafish can be trained in a short period to consume stable levels of 10% or 20% ethanol (v/v) mixed with gelatin and that their intake of this ethanol-gelatin mixture leads to pharmacologically relevant blood ethanol concentrations which are strongly, positively correlated with the amount ingested. Intake of this ethanol-gelatin mixture increased locomotion, reduced anxiety, and stimulated aggressive behavior, while increasing expression of GAL and OX in specific hypothalamic areas. These findings, confirming results in rats, provide a method in zebrafish for investigating with forward genetics and pharmacological techniques the role of different brain mechanisms in controlling ethanol intake. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Survey on the micro-pollutants presence in surface water system of northern Serbia and environmental and health risk assessment
AB  - This study demonstrates the occurrence of 940 organic micro-pollutants in surface water of four rivers, one irrigation canal system, and two lakes in Vojvodina Province, the northern part of Serbia, summing in total eighteen samples. The number of detected chemicals ranged from 22 to 84, with 127 micro-pollutants detected at least once, representing 13% of the studied substances. The targeted compounds include n-alkanes, sterols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, pharmaceutical active compounds, industrial chemicals, plasticizers, etc. Among the analysed compounds, sterols were the most dominant with maximum quantified concentrations. The substances which were quantified with frequency over 50% were two PAHs (2-methylnaphthalene, benzo(ghi)perylene), five sterols (cholesterol, cholestanol, stigmasterol, fucosterol, beta-sitosterol), three pharmaceuticals and personal care products (L-menthol, diethyltoluamide, caffeine), and ten household chemicals (4-tert-octylphenol, dimethyl phthalate, methyl palmitate, phenylethyl alcohol, 1-nonanol, alpha-terpineol, 2-phenoxy-ethanol, methyl myristate, acetophenone, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol). The list of priority substances under the European Union Directive 2013/39/EU includes 49 priority substances (PSs) out of which 34 were analysed. Among these, eleven PSs were quantified, and only two compounds (fluoranthene and benzo (a) pyrene) exceeded EU Environmental Quality Standards targeted values. The obtained results were compared with the previously published data that dealt with the same targeted number of micro-pollutants in sediment samples. This revealed connections between the same sampling locations. Environmental risk assessment showed the existence of potential ecological risk as 72% of the obtained values for the ecological hazard index (HI) at investigated locations were higher that the targeted value (HI &gt; 1). Estimated values for hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) for non-carcinogenic risk were lower than the targeted value, indicating no non-carcinogenic risk through dermal contact and non-intentional ingestion of water. Estimated values for cancer risk were all below 1 × 10 −6 , which is not considered to pose significant human health risk. © 2018

TI  - Nickel exposure alters behavioral parameters in larval and adult zebrafish
AB  - Nickel is a heavy metal that, at high concentrations, leads to environmental contamination and causes health problems. We evaluated the effects of NiCl2 exposure on cognition and behavior in larval and adult zebrafish. Larval and adult zebrafish were exposed to NiCl2 concentrations (0.025, 2.0, 5.0, and 15.0 mg/L) or water (control) in two treatment regimens: acute and subchronic. Larvae were exposed to NiCl2 for 2 h (acute treatment: 5-day-old larvae treated for 2 h, tested after treatment) or 11 days (subchronic treatment: 11-day-old larvae treated since fertilization, tested at 5, 8 and 11 days post-fertilization, dpf). Adults were exposed for 12 h (acute treatment) or 96 h (subchronic treatment) and were tested after the treatment period. In both regimens, exposed zebrafish showed concentration-dependent increases in body nickel levels compared with controls. For larvae, delayed hatching, decreased heart rate and morphological alterations were observed in subchronically treated zebrafish. Larvae from subchronic treatment tested at 5 dpf decrease distance and mean speed at a low concentration (0.025 mg/L) and increased at higher concentrations (5.0 and 15.0 mg/L). Subchronic treated larvae decrease locomotion at 15.0 mg/L at 8 and 11 dpf, whereas decreased escape responses to an aversive stimulus was observed at 2.0, 5.0 and 15.0 mg/L in all developmental stages. For adults, the exploratory behavior test showed that subchronic nickel exposure induced anxiogenic-like behavior and decrease aggression, whereas impaired memory was observed in both treatments. These results indicate that exposure to nickel in early life stages of zebrafish leads to morphological alterations, avoidance response impairment and locomotor deficits whereas acute and subchronic exposure in adults resulst in anxiogenic effects, impaired memory and decreased aggressive behavior. These effects may be associated to neurotoxic actions of nickel and suggest this metal may influence animals’ physiology in doses that do not necessarily impact their survival. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of the environmental pollutant 4-nonylphenol in zebrafish
AB  - 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP), an estrogen mimicking compound is produced by biodegradation of alkylethoxylates. It is well established that 4-NP can affect the development of aquatic animals by disrupting the endocrine signals. Here we show for the first time in zebrafish that 4-NP does not only target the neuroendocrine system but also the notochord and the muscle. The notochord malformation was first evident as distortions at 24hourspostfertilization (hpf) which within 24h appeared as kinks and herniations. The notochord phenotype was accompanied by reduced motility and impaired swimming behavior. Whole-mount in situ hybridization using chordamesoderm markers and electron microscopic analysis showed failure in the notochord differentiation and disruption of the perinotochordal basement membrane. Late larval stages of 4-NP treated embryos displayed abnormal mineralization, vertebral curvature, fusion of vertebral bodies and abnormal extension of haemal arches. The muscle structure and the maximal active force in isolated muscle preparations were similar between 4-NP exposed and of control embryos, suggesting that 4-NP did not induce major changes in striated muscle function. However, repeated electrical stimulation (&gt;40Hz) of the 4-NP exposed larvae revealed an impaired relaxation between stimuli, possibly reflecting an alteration in the relaxant mechanisms (e.g. in cellular Ca 2+ removal) which could explain the abnormal swimming pattern exhibited by 4-NP exposed larvae. Additionally, we demonstrate that the expression levels of the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing hormonewere elevated in the brain following 4-NP treatment. We also observed a significant decrease in the transcript levels of luteinizing hormone b at early larval stages. Collectively, our results show that 4-NP is able to disrupt the notochord morphogenesis, muscle function and the neuroendocrine system. These data suggest that 4-NP enduringly affects the embryonic development in zebrafish and that this compound might exert these deleterious effects through diverse signaling pathways. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The effects of chronic amitriptyline on zebrafish behavior and monoamine neurochemistry
AB  - Amitriptyline is a commonly used tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The exact CNS action of TCAs remains poorly understood, necessitating new screening approaches and novel model organisms. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a promising tool for pharmacological research of antidepressants, including amitriptyline. Here, we examine the effects of chronic 2-week exposure to 10 and 50 μg/L amitriptyline on zebrafish behavior and monoamine neurotransmitters. Overall, the drug at 50 μg/L evoked pronounced anxiolytic-like effects in the novel tank test (assessed by more time in top, fewer transition and shorter latency to enter the top). Like other TCAs, amitriptyline reduced serotonin turnover, but also significantly elevated whole-brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels. The latter effect was not reported in this model previously, and accompanied higher brain expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis), but unaltered expression of dopamine-β-hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase (the enzymes of dopamine metabolism). This response may underlie chronic amitriptyline action on dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission, and contribute to the complex CNS profile of this drug observed both clinically and in animal models. Collectively, these findings also confirm the important role of monoamine modulation in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish, and support the utility of this organism as a promising in-vivo model for CNS drug screening. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018.

TI  - Dose-dependent compensation responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis of zebrafish exposed to the fungicide prochloraz
AB  - Compensation responses and adaptability of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis have been reported in fish exposed to model chemicals, however due to its importance in predictive toxicology further study was needed to elucidate details of the integrated responses to model chemicals. Transcriptional profiles of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2) in plasma were measured in male and female zebrafish that had been exposed to one of seven concentrations of the fungicide, prochloraz: low (1, 3 or 10. μg/L), medium (30 or 100. μg/L) or high concentrations (300 or 1000. μg/L) for 4 days. In zebrafish exposed to the low and medium concentrations of prochloraz, compensation responses of the HPG axis through transcription, occurred in brain (up-regulation of gnrh, gnrhr and lhβ) and both brain and gonad (up-regulation of steroidogenic genes), respectively. Concentrations of E2 in plasma and expression of estrogen receptor 1 (. er1) and vitellogenins (. vtgs) in liver did not change. This result suggested that compensatory responses were successful in maintaining homeostasis. In zebrafish exposed to the two greatest concentrations, compensatory responses occurred in brain, gonad and liver through up-regulation of er2β, but it failed to maintain concentration of E2 in blood plasma and expression of er1 and vtgs in liver. Collectedly, the results observed in this study allowed characterization of dose-dependent compensatory responses along the HPG axis and liver and identified key linkages between compensatory responses occurring in brain, gonad and liver after exposure to prochloraz. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Caffeine neuroprotects against dexamethasone-induced anxiety-like behaviour in the Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - The early-life stress has critical impact on brain development which can lead to long-term effects on brain functions during adulthood. It has been reported that caffeine possesses a protective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this study investigates the potential of caffeine to protect brain functions from adverse effects due to stress exposure during early-life development in the male zebrafish. In the first part of this study, synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX) (2-200. mg/L for 24. h) was used to induce stress effects in the zebrafish larvae from 4 to 5. days post-fertilisation (dpf) and the effect of DEX administration on zebrafish larvae on anxiety-like behaviour during adulthood in novel tank test was investigated. Next, the possible protective effect of caffeine pre-treatment (5-50. mg/L for 24. h from 3 to 4. dpf) before DEX administration was studied. DEX-treated adult male zebrafish showed higher anxiety levels in behavioural tests, as seen in longer latency to enter the top part of the tank, lower transition numbers between the top and bottom parts with more time spent at the bottom and lesser time spent at the top and lower distance travelled at top part. The effect of DEX on anxiety-like behaviour was dose-dependent. Importantly, adult male zebrafish pre-treated with caffeine before DEX treatment did not show any anxiety-like behaviour. These results show that exposure to stress during early-life leads to anxiety-like behaviour in the adult male zebrafish but pre-treatment with caffeine protects from stress-induced anxiety. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effects of ethanol on the shoaling behavior of Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Ethanol (EtOH) often has stimulatory effects at low doses and inhibitory effects at high doses, affecting behavior and physiology of many organisms in a non-linear manner suggestive of hormesis. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) shoaling was studied in adult fish exposed to one of five different EtOH concentrations (v/v): 0.0% control, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. Digital photographs of groups of four fish were taken every 2 min, with each trial lasting a total of 12 min. The median nearest neighbor distance and shoal area were calculated for each photograph. Exposure to 1.0% EtOH inhibited shoaling. In contrast, as predicted from hormesis, shoaling was significantly tighter (as measured by nearest neighbor distance) at low concentrations (0.125%, 0.25%) compared to the control, and a J-shaped dose-response curve was present. A similar pattern occurred for shoal area, but in this case the only statistically significant differences were between the high concentration and all others. © 2010 University of Massachusetts.

TI  - Surveillance of plasticizers, bisphenol A, steroids and caffeine in surface water of River Ganga and Sundarban wetland along the Bay of Bengal: occurrence, sources, estrogenicity screening and ecotoxicological risk assessment
AB  - The transboundary River Ganga serves as a conduit for meltwater from the Himalayas and is a major freshwater source for two thirds of Indian population before emptying into the Sundarban Delta, the largest estuary in the Bay of Bengal. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and bisphenol A (BPA) used as organic plastic additives can pollute the aquatic environment receiving plastic litter. Hence, we have investigated these EDCs in water samples from Ganga and Sundarban wetland of India. Since these compounds exhibit estrogenic potential, we have further measured steroids and evaluated the estrogenic activity (estradiol equivalents, BioE2Eqs) using an in-vitro bioassay (E-Screen). Further BioE2Eqs were compared with the sum of predicted estradiol equivalents based on the chemical concentrations of PAEs and BPA by E-Screen (ChemE2Eq) and YES factors (ChemYES). Caffeine was measured as a marker for anthropogenic wastewater discharge. Results showed that the highest BioE2Eq (below the lowest observable effect of E2 on fish) was associated with sites having sewer outfalls in the middle stretch of the river, and concomitantly coinciding with the elevated concentrations of caffeine. Neither ChemE2Eq nor ChemYES correlated with measured BioE2Eqs. River concentrations of BPA (0.04–4.46 µg/L) and ∑7plasticizers (0.43–7.63 µg/L) were higher than BPA (0.21–2.82 µg/L) and ∑7plasticizers (0.85–2 µg/L) in the Sundarban wetland. The only steroids detected were androgens, found at four sites in Ganga (0.007 µg/L± 0.003, mean ± S.D.). The highest estimated ecotoxicological risk to aquatic insect and fish stemmed from BPA.

TI  - Triclosan alters adult zebrafish behavior and targets acetylcholinesterase activity and expression
AB  - Triclosan is widely used in consumer products as an antimicrobial agent. Epidemiological studies have reported the association of triclosan with adverse birth outcomes. The toxic effects of triclosan on the developing stages of zebrafish are reported, however, its role as behavioral modifier is limited. In the present study, adult zebrafish were exposed to triclosan (0.3 and 0.6 mg/L) for 48 h and the exploratory behavior was analyzed using ZebraTrack. Triclosan exposed group showed significantly reduced locomotion concomitant with increased freezing duration. They also showed erratic movements suggesting that triclosan induced anxiety-like behavior in adult zebrafish. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the anxiety-like behavior is linked to altered acetylcholinesterase activity. We found that the triclosan exposure decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain and skeletal muscle but acetylcholinesterase (ache) gene was significantly down-regulated only in the skeletal muscle of the adult zebrafish exposed to triclosan. In addition, we also observed a down-regulation of myelin basic protein (mbp) gene in the skeletal muscle of adult zebrafish treated with triclosan. Thus, our data indicates that even short exposure of triclosan is potent enough to induce behavioral anomalies in adult zebrafish that appear to involve acetylcholinesterase and other structural proteins especially in the skeletal muscle. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Endocrine disruptors affect larval zebrafish behavior: Testing potential mechanisms and comparisons of behavioral sensitivity to alternative biomarkers
AB  - Larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a tool for assessing endocrine disruption during early development. Here, we investigated the extent to which a simple light/dark behavioral test at five days post fertilization could compliment current methods within the field. We exposed fertilized embryos to hormones (17β-estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, 11-ketotestosterone, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, progesterone, and hydrocortisone) and other relevant compounds (17α ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, bisphenol S, nonylphenol, flutamide, nilutamide, linuron, drospirenone, potassium perchlorate, mifepristone, and fadrozole) to screen for behavioral effects between 96 and 118 h post fertilization (hpf). With the exception of progesterone, all the hormones tested resulted in altered behaviors. However, some inconsistencies were observed regarding the age of the larvae at testing. For example, the xenoestrogens 17α- ethinylestradiol and nonylphenol had behavioral effects at 96 hpf, but not at 118 hpf. Furthermore, although thyroxine exposure had pronounced effects on behavior, the thyroid disruptor potassium perchlorate did not. Finally, we were unable to demonstrate a role of nuclear receptors following testosterone and 17α- ethinylestradiol exposure, as neither the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide nor the general estrogen receptor inhibitor fulvestrant (ICI) could rescue the observed behavioral effects, respectively. Similarly, molecular markers for androgen and estrogen disruption were upregulated at concentrations below which behavioral effects were observed. These results demonstrate hormones and endocrine disruptors can alter the behavior of larval zebrafish, but the mechanistic pathways remain unclear. © 2017

TI  - Response mechanisms to joint exposure of triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives on zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior
AB  - Triclosan (TCS), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) frequently co-exist in real-world aquatic environments; the latter two contaminants contributing to TCS photolytic products or chlorinated derivatives. There is a paucity of information regarding their joint toxicity to aquatic organisms leading us to study their effects on the swimming behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Herein, we reported that 0.28 mg/L TDT exposure (mixtures of TCS, 2,4,6-TCP and 2,4-DCP) enhanced 24-hpf embryonic spontaneous movement frequency, 96-hpf larval activity; however, the 0.56 and 1.12 mg/L TDT treatments decreased all of these behavioral endpoints. All adult behavioral tests demonstrated that chronic TDT exposure (0.14 mg/L) led to hyperactivity and restlessness in adult zebrafish. A 0.14 mg/L TD DATE /@ “M/d/yyyy” 11/21/2017T treatment led to anxiety-like behavior in a bottom dwelling test and excessive panic and low hedging capacity in a conditioned place preference test. Social interaction test demonstrated that zebrafish preferred quiet and isolated space in response to TDT stress. Zebrafish memory was significantly decreased in a T-maze experiment. Whole mount in situ hybridization of pax2a and bcl2l11 genes revealed that their differential expression in the brain and skeleton were related to the corresponding phenotypic behavioral abnormality. A series of biomarker and estrogen receptor assays demonstrated that TDT acute exposure caused abnormal energy metabolism and neurological diseases. AO staining revealed that TDT exposure produced vascular ablation in the head, as well as the occurrence of massive apoptosis in the brain. TEM observation showed pyknosis of nucleus following TDT exposure. These results allow assessment of mechanisms for zebrafish abnormal behavior in response to TDT exposure, and are useful for early intervention and gene therapy of contaminant-induced diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Evaluation of the spinal effects of phthalates in a zebrafish embryo assay
AB  - Phthalates (phthalate esters, PAEs) are commonly used as plasticizers and are emerging concerns worldwide for their potential influence on the environment and general public health. Thus, identification of the negative effects and involved mechanisms of PAEs is necessary. Herein, we found that embryonic exposure of zebrafish to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-butyl phthalate (DBP) significantly induced spinal defects, such as inhibited spontaneous movement at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), spine curvature and body length decrease at 96 hpf. The transcriptional level of the genes that are related to the development of the notochord (col8a1a and ngs), muscle (stac3, klhl41a and smyd2b) and skeleton (bmp2, spp1) were significantly altered by DEHP and DBP at 50 and 250 μg/L, which might be associated with the observed morphological changes. Notably, DBP and DEHP altered the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 144 hpf, which might be due to the abnormal development of the spine and skeletal system. In conclusion, phthalates caused spinal birth defects in zebrafish embryos, induced transcriptional alterations of the spinal developmental genes, and led to abnormal behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A journey through the pituitary gland: Development, structure and function, with emphasis on embryo-foetal and later development
AB  - The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are morphologically and functionally associated in the endocrine and neuroendocrine control of other endocrine glands. They therefore play a key role in a number of regulatory feedback processes that co-ordinate the whole endocrine system. Here we review the neuroendocrine system, from the discoveries that led to its identification to some recently clarified embryological, functional, and morphological aspects. In particular we review the pituitary gland and the main notions related to its development, organization, cell differentiation, and vascularization. Given the crucial importance of the factors controlling neuroendocrine system development to understand parvocellular neuron function and the aetiology of the congenital disorders related to hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, we also provide an overview of the molecular and genetic studies that have advanced our knowledge in the field. Through the action of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland is involved in the control of a broad range of key aspects of our lives: the review focuses on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, particularly GnRH, whose abnormal secretion is associated with clinical conditions involving delayed or absent puberty and reproductive dysfunction. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Calcium-mediated aponecrosis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of estrogenic chemical-induced neurotoxicity
AB  - Estrogen is traditionally associated with females but is also present in males, and influences aspects of brain chemistry and brain morphology in males, females and also during prenatal development. Humans as well as animals are additionally exposed to environmental products that mimic estrogen activity, also known as endocrine disrupters (EDCs). This hypothesis article investigates the role of estrogen (and also EDCs) in the brain and how it influences the Ca2+ pathway. Ca2+ and its movement in and out of the cell is an extremely important ion controlling normal cell physiology. Any dysfunction in the movement from outside to inside the cell or between organelles may have fundamentally negative effects and the disturbance may even lead to apoptosis and/or necrosis. Therefore we consider whether estrogen and EDCs may alter the Ca2+ physiology and whether these changes may be one of the main causes of interference in physiology that is seen when humans and animals are exposed to EDCs. We come to the conclusion that on a molecular level Ca2+ and Ca2+ fluxes ([Ca2+]i, endocrine disrupting chemicals, redox modulation, mitochondria and cytochrome c followed by apoptosis, necrosis or most likely aponecrosis may contribute to chemical-mediated developmental toxicity. Similarly, we hypothesize that calcium-mediated aponecrosis do not only play a central role in the pathophysiology of estrogenic chemical-induced neurotoxicity, but can contribute to chemical-mediated developmental toxicity in general, thereby affecting almost all cells and organs of the living organism. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Female adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) show higher levels of anxiety-like behavior than males, but do not differ in learning and memory capacity
AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used as a translational model for human neuropsychiatric conditions. Many studies have not considered sex differences in their analyses. Here, we studied sex differences of adult zebrafish in two behavioral domains: Anxiety and Memory. To assess whether sex influences anxiety-like responses, we used two different behavioral protocols, the novel tank diving task and the light–dark test. To assess sex differences in learning and memory tasks, we explored two memory domains, short-term spatial memory (free movement pattern Y-maze task) and short-term fear memory (Pavlovian fear-conditioning task). Although we did not find any significant difference in learning and memory tasks, female zebrafish showed robust increases in anxiety-like behavioral endpoints in both anxiety tests. Overall, our data suggest that zebrafish is a sensitive model to work with sex differences when modeling anxiety-related disorders and this should be an important factor to consider in different experimental designs. © 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Toxicological responses following short-term exposure through gavage feeding or water-borne exposure to Dechlorane Plus in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Dechlorane Plus (DP) is a chlorinated flame retardant widely used worldwide, and has been reported in environment and humans. However, only limited information is currently available on its toxicity on aquatic organisms. In this study, we employed zebrafish to evaluate possible toxicological responses including oxidative stress and endocrine disruption following exposure to DP. DP was dissolved in corn oil and was delivered to adult male zebrafish via gavage feeding. Delivery of DP was carried out twice on days 0 and 2, at up to 3 μg/g fish wet weight. Body residue level of DP in the fish at day 6 was within a range that has been reported in hot spot areas of China. On day 6, blood, liver, testis, and brain were collected and were evaluated for oxidative damage and endocrine disruption. Following DP exposure, hepatic catalase activity significantly increased, implying its oxidative damage potential. In addition, plasma thyroxine (T4) concentrations increased along with up-regulation of corticotropin releasing hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone β genes in brain. Following DP exposure, transcriptional responses of sex hormone related genes in brain were observed, suggesting possible sex hormone disrupting potentials of DP. However, water-borne exposure to DP up to 267 μg/L among the embryo and larval fish did not show any adverse effects on hatching time and transcription of thyroid hormone related genes. Our observations indicate for the first time that DP disrupts thyroid hormone balance of zebrafish by altering regulatory pathways in the brain.Handling editor: David Volz. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Organophosphorus pesticide determination in biological specimens: bioanalytical and toxicological aspects
AB  - Organophosphorus insecticides, such as parathion-ethyl, quinalphos, chlorpyrifos, chlorfenvinphos or diazinon, are still widely used for pest control on crops. These compounds are extremely toxic to humans, and, even though specific legislation exists that controls the use of these substances, the frequency of toxic and/or fatal events and the existing data suggest that they are still easily accessed and the knowledge associated to the risks is not well-recognized. For these reasons, the determination of the exposure to these compounds, their detection (and of their metabolites as well) in biological samples, is of great importance in clinical and forensic toxicology, and, therefore, the development of techniques for this evaluation is an important task for laboratories. Most confirmatory analyses use blood, serum, plasma and urine as biological samples and are performed by either gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric or liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric instrumentation, which represents the gold standard in what concerns high sensitivity. This paper will not only address the physical–chemical and toxicological aspects of this class of compounds but also perform a comprehensive and critical review on the analytical methods available for their determination in biological specimens, with special focus on the latest instrumental developments and sample preparation approaches. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Perinatal exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors in the emergence of neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases: A systematic review
AB  - Background: Exposure to endocrine disruptors is on the rise, with new compounds regularly incriminated. In animals and humans, this exposure during critical developmental windows has been associated with various developmental abnormalities, including the emergence of psychiatric disorders. We aimed to review the association between perinatal endocrine disruptor exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, focusing on cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Methods: We performed a systematic review with key words referring to the fields of neurodevelopment and endocrine disruptors. We reviewed 896 titles, choosing studies on the basis of titles and abstracts. We searched through the methodology sections to find perinatal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, following the categories indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition). References in some studies brought us to a total of 47 studies included here. Results: Convergent studies report an association between exposure to endocrine disruptors and autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, communication disorders and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion: Sufficient data exist to report that exposure to some endocrine disruptors is a risk factor for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Studying endocrine disruptor exposure in humans is still associated with some limits that are difficult to overcome. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticle affects motor behavior, neurodevelopment and axonal growth in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae
AB  - More attention has been recently paid to the ecotoxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) owing to its common use in many fields. Although previous studies have shown that nano-TiO2 is neurotoxic, the mechanism is still largely unknown. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/L nano-TiO2 and 1.0 mg/L micro-TiO2 for up to 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Exposure to 1.0 mg/L nano-TiO2 significantly decreased the body length and weight of zebrafish larvae; however, the hatching and mortality rate of zebrafish embryos did not change. Behavioral tests showed that nano-TiO2 exposure significantly reduced the swimming speed and clockwise rotation times of the larvae. The results revealed that nano-TiO2 treatment adversely affected motor neuron axon length in Tg (hb9-GFP) zebrafish and decreased central nervous system (CNS) neurogenesis in Tg (HuC-GFP) zebrafish. Additionally, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that genes associated with neurogenesis (nrd and elavl3) and axonal growth (α1-tubulin, mbp, and gap43) were significantly affected by nano-TiO2 exposure. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that early-life stage exposure of zebrafish to nano-TiO2 causes adverse neural outcomes through the inhibition of neurodevelopment and motor neuron axonal growth. © 2020

TI  - Ameliorative effects of rhoifolin in scopolamine-induced amnesic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model
AB  - Rhoifolin (Rho) exerts many biological activities such as anticancer, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, antirheumatic, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. The neuroprotective action of this compound has not been studied. The goal of this study was to investigate the improvement impact of Rho on scopolamine (Sco)-induced zebrafish anxiety, amnesia, and brain oxidative stress and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Zebrafish were treated with Rho (1, 3, and 5 µg/L) for nine consecutive days and were subsequently subjected to Sco (100 µM) 30 min before behavioral tests (novel tank diving test, Y-maze, and novel object recognition tests). Rho was isolated from Chorisia crispiflora (Malvaceae) leaves and identified by different spectroscopic techniques. To further assess the possible mechanisms of Rho in enhancing the memory capacities in zebrafish, the in vivo antioxidant status and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also evaluated. Rho from Chorisia crispiflora leaves was identified. Rho could alleviate anxiety, memory deficits, and brain oxidative stress in Sco-treated zebrafish and could regulate the cholinergic function by inhibiting the AChE activity. Our results demonstrated that Rho could be a promising candidate compound against anxiety and amnesia by restoring the cholinergic activity and the amelioration of brain oxidative stress. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Psychopharmacological effects of acute exposure to kynurenic acid (KYNA) in zebrafish
AB  - A metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an important endogenous neuromodulator and neuroprotector, that also exerts neurotropic effects following exogenous administration. In humans and animals, KYNA regulates affective and cognitive responses, acting mainly as an antagonist of glutamatergic receptors. However, the complete psychopharmacological profile of KYNA (which includes the activity of several neurotransmitter receptors) is poorly understood, and merit further studies. Aquatic models are rapidly emerging as useful tools in translational psychopharmacology research. Here, we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to exogenous KYNA for 20 min, and assessed their behavior in the novel tank test. Exposure to KYNA (20 mg/L) in this paradigm evoked overt effects in fish, including decreased latency to enter the top half of the tank, increased number of top entries and longer top duration. In contrast, locomotor activity indices (swimming distance and velocity) were not affected by KYNA in this study. Overall, our results show KYNA has an anxiolytic-like pharmacological effect in zebrafish, and therefore strongly support the utility of zebrafish models in neurotropic drug screening, including drugs acting at central glutamatergic system. Robust phenotypic differences evoked by KYNA, revealed here using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion in X, Y and time (Z) coordinates, confirm this notion, also demonstrating the value of 3D-based phenotyping approaches for high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish models. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Developmental toxicity of disinfection by-product monohaloacetamides in embryo-larval stage of zebrafish
AB  - As an emerging class of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs), haloacetamides (HAcAms) have been widely detected in drinking water. Limited toxicity studies have shown an inconsistent toxicity of monoHAcAms, including CAcAm, BAcAm and IAcAm. In this study, the developmental toxicity of monoHAcAms was evaluated in embryo-larval stage of zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to one concentration of 2.50, 5.00, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0 and 80.0 mg/L monoHAcAms from 4 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. Multiple endpoints, including hatching rate, morphological abnormalities, mortality as well as locomotor behavior were assessed at specified stages (24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hpf). Results showed that 80 mg/L CAcAm and 40 mg/L BAcAm significantly decreased the hatching rate, IAcAm decreased the hatching rate and delayed the hatching process in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 16.37 mg/L at 72 hpf. The frequency and severity order of morphological abnormalities increased with the raised exposure concentrations and prolonged exposure time, and the corresponding EC50 at 96 hpf were 21.10, 9.77 and 16.60 mg/L for CAcAm, BAcAm and IAcAm, respectively. MonoHAcAms exposure resulted in a time- and dose-dependent response in mortality and the calculated LC50 at 72 hpf were 38.44, 17.74 and 28.82 mg/L for CAcAm, BAcAm and IAcAm, respectively. Based on EC50 for morphological abnormalities and LC50, a toxicity rank order of BAcAm &gt; IAcAm &gt; CAcAm was observed. Different degrees of hyperactivity and hypoactivity were observed from locomotor behavior analysis in larvae from ≤10.0 mg/L monoHAcAms exposure groups. The light-dark periodic change was disappeared in larvae of 10.0 mg/L BAcAm exposure group. In summary, our study showed that monoHAcAms were developmentally toxic to zebrafish even at very low concentrations and BAcAm exerted higher toxicity than IAcAm and CAcAm. These results will further our understanding of the toxicity of HAcAms and its potential toxicological impact on human and ecological environment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Ketamine modulates aggressive behavior in adult zebrafish
AB  - Ketamine is a non-competitive glutamatergic antagonist that induces analgesia and anesthesia. Although ketamine displays anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, it may induce pro-psychosis and hallucinogen effects, as well as stereotypic behaviors following acute administration at sub-anesthetic doses. Since heightened aggression is maladaptive and may comorbid with various neuropsychiatric disorders, we aimed to investigate whether ketamine modulates aggressive behavior in adult zebrafish. Fish were acutely exposed to 2, 20, and 40 mg/L ketamine for 20 min and their locomotion, exploratory activity, and aggression towards mirror were further assessed. Ketamine (2 mg/L) increased aggression-related phenotypes, while 20 and 40 mg/L reduced aggression and elicited stereotypic behaviors by causing hyperlocomotion, altering motor patterns, and increasing circling behavior at the higher concentration tested. Collectively, our data expand the utility of zebrafish models to investigate the influence of sub-anesthetic concentrations of ketamine on aggression behavior domain in translational neuropsychiatric research field. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Targeted mutation of secretogranin-2 disrupts sexual behavior and reproduction in zebrafish
AB  - The luteinizing hormone surge is essential for fertility as it triggers ovulation in females and sperm release in males. We previously reported that secretoneurin-a, a neuropeptide derived from the processing of secretogranin-2a (Scg2a), stimulates luteinizing hormone release, suggesting a role in reproduction. Here we provide evidence that mutation of the scg2a and scg2b genes using TALENs in zebrafish reduces sexual behavior, ovulation, oviposition, and fertility. Large-scale spawning within-line crossings (n = 82 to 101) were conducted. Wild-type (WT) males paired with WT females successfully spawned in 62% of the breeding trials. Spawning success was reduced to 37% (P = 0.006), 44% (P = 0.0169), and 6% (P &lt; 0.0001) for scg2a−/−, scg2b−/−, and scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− mutants, respectively. Comprehensive video analysis indicates that scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− mutation reduces all male courtship behaviors. Spawning success was 47% in saline-injected WT controls compared to 11% in saline-injected scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− double mutants. For these mutants, spawning success increased 3-fold following a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of synthetic secretoneurin-a (P = 0.0403) and increased 3.5-fold with injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Embryonic survival at 24 h remained on average lower in scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− fish compared to WT injected with secretoneurin-a (P &lt; 0.001). Significant reductions in the expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 3 in the hypothalamus, and luteinizing hormone beta and glycoprotein alpha subunits in the pituitary provide evidence for disrupted hypothalamo-pituitary function in scg2a and scg2b mutant fish. Our results indicate that secretogranin-2 is required for optimal reproductive function and support the hypothesis that secretoneurin is a reproductive hormone. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - The effects of fluorene-9-bisphenol on female zebrafish (Danio rerio) reproductive and exploratory behaviors
AB  - Endocrine disruptor chemicals induce adverse effects to animals’ development, reproduction and behavior in environment. We investigated the effects of fluorene-9-bisphenol (BHPF), one substitute of bisphenol A, on courtship behavior and exploratory behavior of adult zebrafish. Customized apparatus was used to evaluate courtship behavior. The result showed that the male spent less time with BHPF and anti-oestrogenic fulvestrant (FULV) treated female in region of approaching (ROA). Courtship index between BHPF-exposed female and male decreased. The body orientation of BHPF- and FULV-exposed female to male decreased. Furthermore, BHPF exposure downregulated the expression of genes related to estrogen receptor, steroidogenesis and upregulated oxidative stress related genes. It indicated that BHPF exposure interfered the preference of male and female in courtship, and induced detrimental effects on reproduction. BHPF treatment decreased locomotor activity and time spent in top, increased freezing bouts, and induced anxiety/depression-like behavior. The tyrosine hydroxylase in brain decreased under BHPF exposure. Here we showed the potential adverse effects of BHPF on reproduction and exploratory behaviors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Genetic editing of the androgen receptor contributes to impaired male courtship behavior in zebrafish
AB  - Elucidating the genes that contribute to behavioral variation has become an important endeavor in behavioral studies. While advances in genomics have narrowed down the list of candidate genes, functional validation of them has lagged behind, partly because of challenges associated with rapid gene manipulations. Consequently, few studies have demonstrated causal genetic changes linked to behaviors. The 'gene editing revolution' has offered unprecedented opportunities to investigate candidate genes responsible for critical behaviors. Here, we edited the androgen receptor gene (AR), which is associated with male reproductive behavior in zebrafish, using TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), and tested whether modifications at the AR impacted courtship during mating trials. We reveal that males lacking AR courted females significantly less, showing reduced levels of stereotypic behaviors. Consistent with previous studies, disrupting androgen mechanisms can lead to behavioral changes with potential fitness consequences. Our study highlights the possibility of genetically altering a reproductive behavior, further solidifying the link between genotype and behavior. © 2017. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - The recreational drug ecstasy disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal reproductive axis in adult male rats
AB  - Reproductive function involves an interaction of three regulatory levels: hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonad. The primary drive upon this system comes from hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurosecretory cells, which receive afferent inputs from other neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system to result in the proper coordination of reproduction and the environment. Here, we hypothesized that the recreational drug (±)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy'), which acts through several of the neurotransmitter systems that affect GnRH neurons, suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal reproductive axis of male rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered saline or MDMA either once (acute) or for 20 days (chronic) and were euthanized 7 days following the last administration. We quantified hypothalamic GnRH mRNA, serum luteinizing hormone concentrations, and serum testosterone levels as indices of hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal functions, respectively. The results indicate that the hypothalamic and gonadal levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are significantly altered by MDMA, with GnRH mRNA and serum testosterone levels suppressed in rats administered MDMA compared to saline. Furthermore, our finding that hypothalamic GnRH mRNA levels are suppressed in the context of low testosterone concentrations suggests that the central GnRH neurosecretory system may be a primary target of inhibitory regulation by MDMA usage.

TI  - Hypochlorous acid is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase
AB  - The role of hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite in the induction of airway hyperreactivity has been well described. Another reactive species which is formed during airway inflammation is hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In the present investigation the effect of HOCl on cholinergic innervation of the airway was investigated. It was observed that HOCl was capable of increasing the basal tension of electrically stimulated tracheal smooth muscle. It was found that HOCl inhibits purified acetylcholinesterase with an IC50 value of 0.66 μM. Decreased acetylcholinesterase activity could allow accumulation of acetylcholine and increased airway muscle tension. The effects of HOCl on the isolated organ and the enzyme preparation could be precluded with thiol group-containing compounds such as reduced glutathione and N-acetylcysteine. The present findings indicate that HOCl can act as inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. The implications of this finding for the induction of airway hyperreactivity are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

TI  - Nitric oxide is involved in acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced myopathy in rats
AB  - Excess activation of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors due to genetic mutations, as seen in slow channel congenital myasthenic syndrome, or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition results in muscle cell degeneration. Our recent work showed that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors prevent nicotine-induced muscle cell death in culture. In the present study, we examined the effects of NOS inhibition on nicotinic receptor-mediated myopathy in vivo. Rats injected with the AChE inhibitor paraoxon demonstrate a 90-fold increase in the number of dying muscle cells compared with control as evidenced histologically by centralized nuclei and the presence of degenerating profiles. Coadministration of the nonspecific NOS inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or the neuronal NOS-specific inhibitor 7-nitroindazole dramatically reduced the presence of such degenerating profiles to 20% of that seen with paraoxon alone. These results show that inhibition of NOS, as well as neuronal NOS, significantly reduces AChE inhibitor-induced muscle cell degeneration, suggesting that increased nitric oxide production mediates such myopathy.

TI  - Chronic exposure to bisphenol S induces oxidative stress, abnormal anxiety, and fear responses in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) is increasingly used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products, resulting in its ubiquitous distribution across the environment, including aquatic ecosystems. Although it is commonly known as a weak/moderate estrogenic compound, there has been a growing acknowledgment of the potential of BPS to cause toxicity by inducing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a major participant in the development of anxiety-like behaviors in humans and animals. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the impact of BPS on anxiety-like behavior and fear responses in adult zebrafish and also to elucidate the possible linkage between the BPS neurotoxicity and oxidative status of the brain. To this end, adult male and female zebrafish were exposed to 0 (control), 1, 10, and 30 μg/L of BPS and 1 μg/L of 17-β-estradiol (E2) for 75 days. Following exposure, changes in anxiety and fear-related responses were evaluated by applying a novel tank test and by exposing focal fish to chemical alarm cues. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of multiple antioxidant genes in the zebrafish brain. Our results indicate that BPS, irrespective of exposure concentration, and E2 significantly decreased bottom-dwelling behavior and the latency to enter the upper water column. Furthermore, exposure to the highest concentration of BPS and E2 induced a significant decrease in fear-related responses. The impaired anxiety and reduced fear-related responses were associated with a down-regulation in the transcription of genes involved in enzymatic antioxidant defense. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic exposure to BPS impairs anxiety and fear responses in adult zebrafish, possibly by inducing oxidative stress in the brain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sub-lethal doses of polybrominated diphenyl ethers affect some biomarkers involved in energy balance and cell cycle, via oxidative stress in the marine fish cell line SAF-1
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of persistent contaminants which are found all over the world in the marine environment. Sparus aurata fibroblast cell line (SAF-1) was exposed to increasing concentrations of PBDEs 47 and 99, until 72 h to evaluate the cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the expression of some selected molecular markers related to cell cycle, cell signaling, energetic balance and oxidative stress (p53, erk-1, hif-1α and nrf-2), by real-time PCR. Furthermore, SAF-1 cells were exposed for 7 and 15 days to sub-lethal concentrations, in order to evaluate the response of some biomarkers by immunoblotting (p53, ERK-1, AMPK, HIF-1α and NRF-2). After 48 and 72 h, the cells showed a significant decrease of cell vitality as well as an increase of intracellular ROS production. Gene expression analysis showed that sub-lethal concentrations of BDE-99 and 47, after 72 h, up-regulated cell cycle and oxidative stress biomarkers, although exposure to 100 μmol L−1 down-regulated the selected markers related to cell cycle, cell signaling, energetic balance. After 7 and 15 days of sub-lethal doses exposure, all the analyzed markers resulted affected by the contaminants. Our results suggest that PBDEs influence the cells homeostasis first of all via oxidative stress, reducing the cell response and defense capacity and affecting its energetic levels. This situation of stress and energy imbalance could represents a condition that, modifying some of the analyzed biochemical pathways, would predispose to cellular transformation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Exposure of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to Tetrabromobisphenol A causes neurotoxicity in larval offspring, an adverse transgenerational effect
AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is one of the most extensively used brominated flame retardants and is universally detected in the environment. However, information related to its transgenerational toxicity is sparse. Using zebrafish as a study model, adult fish were exposed to TBBPA at different concentrations (0, 3, 30, or 300 μg/L) for 42 d and then, the exposed adults were spawned in TBBPA-free water. The neurobehavior of adults and larval offspring was evaluated, and the levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid) were quantified in larvae and embryos. Our results showed that TBBPA was detected in embryo and the locomotor activity of larval offspring was significantly reduced, suggesting that TBBPA can transfer to offspring and result in neurotoxicity in larval offspring. Furthermore, a reduction in T3 levels was observed in both the larvae and embryos. We also found a significantly decreased content of dopamine in larval offspring, accompanied by downregulated mRNA expression of rdr2b and drd3. Our results demonstrated that TBBPA can be transferred to offspring embryos, and subsequently induce neurotoxicity in larval offspring by affecting the amount of T3 transferred from the parents to embryos and the production of dopamine in larvae. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Free-movement pattern Y-maze: A cross-species measure of working memory and executive function
AB  - Numerous neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders are associated with deficits in executive functions such as working memory and cognitive flexibility. Progress in developing effective treatments for disorders may benefit from targeting these cognitive impairments, the success of which is predicated on the development of animal models with validated behavioural assays. Zebrafish offer a promising model for studying complex brain disorders, but tasks assessing executive function are lacking. The Free-movement pattern (FMP) Y-maze combines aspects of the common Y-maze assay, which exploits the inherent motivation of an organism to explore an unknown environment, with analysis based on a series of sequential two-choice discriminations. We validate the task as a measure of working memory and executive function by comparing task performance parameters in adult zebrafish treated with a range of glutamatergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic drugs known to impair working memory and cognitive flexibility. We demonstrate the cross-species validity of the task by assessing performance parameters in adapted versions of the task for mice and Drosophila, and finally a virtual version in humans, and identify remarkable commonalities between vertebrate species’ navigation of the maze. Together, our results demonstrate that the FMP Y-maze is a sensitive assay for assessing working memory and cognitive flexibility across species from invertebrates to humans, providing a simple and widely applicable behavioural assay with exceptional translational relevance. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of ecologically relevant concentrations of cadmium on locomotor activity and microbiota in zebrafish
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is widely spread in the aquatic environment, and its impact on humans and the ecosystem is an important issue in public health. However, its effects on zebrafish microbiota are still poorly understood. In this study, the potential developmental neurotoxicity and microbiota dysbiosis of ecologically relevant concentrations of Cd (0, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 μg/L) was evaluated by waterborne exposure for 7 days. The data showed that exposure to 5 μg/L of Cd significantly decreased survival rates and impaired locomotor activities. Uptake of Cd was enhanced with the increase of the concentration and duration of exposure. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed a significant change in the richness and diversity of the microbiota of Cd-treated zebrafish. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased, while that Firmicutes was significantly decreased after exposure to 5 μg/L Cd. At the genus level, there were significant changes in the abundances of several bacteria involved in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases (Pseudomonas, Ruminococcaceae, Blautia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae, and Phascolarctobacterium) in the Cd-treatment groups, as compared to the control group. In addition, the mRNA expression profiles of bdnf and genes involved in serotonin signaling and metabolism were changed in the Cd exposure groups. Together, these data suggest that Cd could be harmful to zebrafish health by inducing the microbiota changes, and the microbiota could serve as a potential target to protect against the adverse effects of Cd toxicity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Acute fluoxetine differently affects aggressive display in zebrafish phenotypes
AB  - Zebrafish have been introduced as a model organism in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry, increasing the breadth of findings using fish to study the neurobiology of aggression. Phenotypic differences between leopard and longfin zebrafish were exploited in order to elucidate the role of phasic serotonin in aggressive displays on this species. The present study, revealed differences in aggressive display between leopard and longfin zebrafish, and a discrepant effect of acute fluoxetine in both populations. In mirror-induced aggression, leopard animals showed higher display latencies than longfin, as well as lower display duration and frequency (Experiment 1). Moreover, 2.5 mg/kg fluoxetine decreased the duration and frequency of display in longfin, but not leopard; and 5 mg/kg fluoxetine increased display frequency in leopard, but not longfin (Experiment 2). It is suggested that zebrafish from the longfin phenotype show more aggressive motivation and readiness in the mirror-induced aggression test than leopard, and that acute fluoxetine increases aggression in leopard and decreased it in longfin zebrafish. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Evaluation of Airborne Organic Pollutants in a Pyrenean Glacial Lake (The Sabocos Tarn)
AB  - Mountain lakes are excellent indicators for airborne organic pollutant transport and accumulation studies. However, very few studies have been focused on lake water mass. Also, there is a lack of studies performed after 2004-2009 period when the enforcement of most international organic pollutant banning policies (e.g., The Stockholm convention) occurred. We report concentration of 66 different semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs) in the Sabocos tarn water mass (a Spanish Pyrenees cirque glacial lake) from 2011 to 2014. Analyzed SOCs include compounds of current and past use with different sources (i.e., current and historic-use pesticides, industrial and urban-use compounds, and combustion by-products) and chemical properties (i.e., volatility, water solubility, and persistence in the environment). Most banned chemicals such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroetanes (DDTs), aldrins, most polybromodiphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, endosulfans, triazine, and simazine were detected in consistently low concentrations. In contrast, chemicals still in use such as BDE-209, terbutilazine, diuron, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos were found in higher and more variable amounts. Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were high as compared to previous studies in other Pyrenean and European lakes suggesting airborne pollution from nearby anthropogenic sources. Overall, levels of hexacyclohexanes (HCHs) during most of the sampling period were low according to other studies in similar environments. However, the Sabocos water mass recorded a concentration peak of some HCH isomers in summer 2014 related with the HCH residues transfer operation at the nearby (20 km) Bailín landfill site (Sabiñánigo, Spain). © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Shoaling, boldness, anxiety-like behavior and locomotion in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are altered by acute benzo[a]pyrene exposure
AB  - Environmental exposure to crude oil and/or its derivatives in fishes can negatively impact survival, morphology and physiology, but relatively little focus has been on behavior. Exposures can influence prey-predator interactions, courtship and other vital behaviors, leading to individual or population disruption at toxicant levels well below those producing morphological or physiological changes. The few behavioral studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on fish behavior have yielded highly inconsistent results, likely relating to chronic vs. acute treatment. A few studies report lethargy and decreased exploratory behavior, while others indicate increased anxiety and greater exploratory behavior with PAH exposure. In our study on zebrafish (Danio rerio), we hypothesized that even relatively brief (30 min) exposure to the PAH benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) would impact group shoaling and individual behaviors in open field and novel object exploration tests. Exposures comprised measured concentrations of 1.0 μM, 10 μM, or 100 μM, B[a]P. Compared to controls, inter-individual distance (IID) was significantly increased by 100 μM B[a]P, but not by 1.0 μM or 10 μM B[a]P. Total distance moved by shoals was decreased significantly at B[a]P concentrations of 1.0 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM. In the open field test of individual locomotion and anxiety-like behavior, time spent in the thigmotaxis zone along the walls of the circular test arena (a proxy for anxiety-like behavior), was decreased at 100 μM. In the novel object approach test to investigate boldness, time spent near the object was significantly increased by both 10 μM and 100 μM B[a]P. Collectively, these data indicate a complex suite of changes in zebrafish including altered shoal dynamics, decreased anxiety, increased boldness, and decreased locomotion associated with exposure to B[a]P. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Deriving water quality criteria for China for the organophosphorus pesticides dichlorvos and malathion
AB  - Organophosphorus pesticides are effective, cheap, and used extensively but can harm aquatic organism and human health. Here, water quality criteria (WQCs) for dichlorvos (DDVP) and malathion (MAL) were derived. Nine aquatic organisms native to China were used in toxicity tests. Published toxicity data for aquatic organisms native and non-native to China were also analyzed. DDVP and MAL WQCs were derived using (log-normal model) species sensitivity distributions. Species sensitivity distribution curves indicated native and non-native species have different sensitivities to DDVP. The sensitivities of native and non-native species to MAL were not different because non-native species data for fewer than eight genera were available, so further research is required. The results indicated that native species need to be considered when deriving WQCs. The criteria maximum concentration (CMC) and criteria continuous concentration (CCC) were 1.33 and 0.132 μg/L, respectively, for DDVP, and 0.100 and 0.008 μg/L, respectively, for MAL. The CMCs for DDVP and MAL derived using ETX 2.0 software and species sensitivity ranks were different from the CMCs obtained using the SSD method because of parameter uncertainties. The DDVP and MAL WQCs were significantly lower than Chinese surface water quality standard thresholds. The results provide basic data for revising these thresholds. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Co-exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors in the US population
AB  - Exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) has been linked to adverse health outcomes. The vast majority of studies examined one class of EEDs at a time but humans often are exposed to multiple EEDs at the same time. It is, therefore, important to know the co-exposure status of multiple EEDs in an individual, to preclude and control for potential confounding effects posed by co-exposed EEDs. This study examined the concentrations of seven classes of EEDs in the US population utilizing the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2009–2014 survey cycles. We applied linear correlation and cluster analysis to characterize the correlation profile and cluster patterns of these EEDs. We found that EEDs with a similar structure are often highly correlated. Among between-class correlations, mercury and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cadmium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were two significantly correlated EEDs. In epidemiologic studies, measurement and control for co-exposure to pollutants, especially those with similar biological effects, are critical when attempting to make causal inferences. Appropriate statistical methods to handle within- and between-class correlations are needed. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Exposure to ayahuasca induces developmental and behavioral alterations on early life stages of zebrafish
AB  - Ayahuasca is a psychoactive concoction prepared from the plants Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis which are used ancestrally by Amazonian Indian populations and more recently, by Christian religious groups in Brazil and other countries. The aims of the present study were to identify the effects of ayahuasca on zebrafish embryo development and neurobehavior. Toxicity and developmental endpoints for zebrafish embryos were assessed from 0 to 1000 mg/L over 96 h of exposure. The effects on locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae were assessed using a video tracking system (ZebraBox) from 0 to 20 mg/L and after 120 and 144 h of exposure. The LC50 of ayahuasca in zebrafish was determined as 236.3 mg/L. Ayahuasca exposure caused significant developmental anomalies in zebrafish embryos, mainly at the highest concentration tested, including hatching delay, loss of equilibrium, edema and the accumulation of red blood cells. Embryo behavior was also significantly affected, with decreased locomotor activity at the highest concentration tested. These results are in accordance with data obtained in mammal studies highlighting the possible risks of uncontrolled use of ayahuasca. Further research employing more specific behavior analysis could provide additional data on both therapeutic benefits and possible toxicological risk of ayahuasca. © 2018

TI  - Moderate early life stress improves adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) working memory but does not affect social and anxiety-like responses
AB  - Early life stress (ELS) is defined as a short or chronic period of trauma, environmental or social deprivation, which can affect different neurochemical and behavioral patterns during adulthood. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been widely used as a model system to understand human neurodevelopmental disorders and display translationally relevant behavioral and stress-regulating systems. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of moderate ELS by exposing young animals (6-weeks postfertilization), for 3 consecutive days, to three stressors, and analyzing the impact of this on adult zebrafish behavior (16-week postfertilization). The ELS impact in adults was assessed through analysis of performance on tests of unconditioned memory (free movement pattern Y-maze test), exploratory and anxiety-related task (novel tank diving test), and social cohesion (shoaling test). Here, we show for the first time that moderate ELS increases the number of alternations in turn-direction compared to repetitions in the unconditioned Y-maze task, suggesting increased working memory, but has no effect on shoal cohesion, locomotor profile, or anxiety-like behavior. Overall, our data suggest that moderate ELS may be linked to adaptive flexibility which contributes to build “resilience” in adult zebrafish by improving working memory performance. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Chemical and genetic zebrafish models to define mechanisms of and treatments for dopaminergic neurodegeneration
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is routinely used in biological studies as a vertebrate model system that provides unique strengths allowing applications in studies of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. One specific advantage is that the neurotransmitter systems are highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, including between zebrafish and humans. Disruption of the dopaminergic signaling pathway is linked to multiple neurological disorders. One of the most common is Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disease associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons, among other neuropathological characteristics. In this review, the development of the zebrafish’s dopaminergic system, focusing on genetic control of the dopaminergic system, is detailed. Second, neurotoxicant models used to study dopaminergic neuronal loss, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the pesticides paraquat and rotenone, and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), are described. Next, zebrafish genetic knockdown models of dj1, pink1, and prkn established for investigating mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease are discussed. Chemical modulators of the dopaminergic system are also highlighted to showcase the applicability of the zebrafish to identify mechanisms and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease associated with the dopaminergic system. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Circadian rhythms in zebrafish (Danio rerio) behaviour and the sources of their variability
AB  - Over recent decades, changes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) behaviour have become popular quantitative indicators in biomedical studies. The circadian rhythms of behavioural processes in zebrafish are known to enable effective utilization of energy and resources, therefore attracting interest in zebrafish as a research model. This review covers a variety of circadian behaviours in this species, including diurnal rhythms of spawning, feeding, locomotor activity, shoaling, light/dark preference, and vertical position preference. Changes in circadian activity during zebrafish ontogeny are reviewed, including ageing-related alterations and chemically induced variations in rhythmicity patterns. Both exogenous and endogenous sources of inter-individual variability in zebrafish circadian behaviour are detailed. Additionally, we focus on different environmental factors with the potential to entrain circadian processes in zebrafish. This review describes two principal ways whereby diurnal behavioural rhythms can be entrained: (i) modulation of organismal physiological state, which can have masking or enhancing effects on behavioural endpoints related to endogenous circadian rhythms, and (ii) modulation of period and amplitude of the endogenous circadian rhythm due to competitive relationships between the primary and secondary zeitgebers. In addition, different peripheral oscillators in zebrafish can be entrained by diverse zeitgebers. This complicated orchestra of divergent influences may cause variability in zebrafish circadian behaviours, which should be given attention when planning behavioural studies. © 2020 Cambridge Philosophical Society

TI  - Modulation of transcription of genes related to the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos/larvae by androstenedione
AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of Androstenodione (AED) on the transcriptional expression of genes involved in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axes in the zebrafish embryos/larvae. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 4.0, 45.0, 487.0, and 980.0 ng/L of AED from the day of fertilization to 144 h post fertilization (hpf), during which the transcriptional profiles of key genes related to the HPG and HPA axes were examined daily using quantitative real-time PCR. The AED exposure significantly up-regulated several receptor signaling pathways and the key genes involved in various steps of the steroidogenic pathways were also affected. In addition, the AED exposure could significantly modulate the transcriptional profiles of the other target genes related to hypothalamic and pituitary hormones. The findings of this study suggest that AED, at environmentally relevant concentrations, affects the adrenal endocrine systems and the reproduction of zebrafish by interrupting the HPG and HPA axes. © 2018

TI  - Determination of monoamine neurotransmitters in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a two-step derivatization
AB  - A sensitive analytical method for the determination of monoamine neurotransmitters (MNTs) in zebrafish larvae was developed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Six MNTs were selected as target compounds for neurotoxicity testing. MNTs underwent a two-step derivatization with hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS) for O-silylation followed by N-methyl-bis-heptafluorobutyramide (MBHFBA) for N-perfluoroacylation. Derivatization conditions were optimized by an experimental design approach. Method validation showed linear calibration curves (r2 &gt; 0.9976) in the range of 1–100 ng for all the compounds. The recovery rates were between 92 and 119%. The method was repeatable and reproducible with relative standard deviations (RSD) in the range of 2.5–9.3% for intra-day and 4.8–12% for inter-day variation. The limits of detection and the limits of quantitation were 0.4–0.8 and 1.2–2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The method was successfully applied to detect and quantify trace levels of MNTs in 5-day-old zebrafish larvae that were exposed to low concentrations of neurotoxic chemicals such as pesticides and methylmercury. Although visual malformations were not detected, the MNT levels varied significantly during early zebrafish development. These results show that exposure to neurotoxic chemicals can alter neurotransmitter levels and thereby may influence early brain development.

TI  - Effects of lincomycin hydrochloride on the neurotoxicity of zebrafish
AB  - Lincomycin hydrochloride is one of the commonly used drugs in clinic. However, it has many side effects on patients, and its mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, 6 h post-fertilization (6 hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to several concentrations of lincomycin hydrochloride (15, 30, 60 μg/mL) for up to 24 or 96 hpf to detect their developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity, and to 6 days post-fertilization (6 dpf) to detect their behavioral toxicity. Our results showed that lincomycin hydrochloride could lead to embryonic head deformities (unclear ventricles, smaller ventricles, fewer new neurons). The studies showed that the frequency of spontaneous tail flick of zebrafish embryo increased at 24 hpf, and the lincomycin hydrochloride exposed zebrafish embryos showed increased heart rate, shorter body length, and yolk sac edema with severe pericardial edema at 96 hpf. The studies also showed that lincomycin hydrochloride increased oxidative stress level, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, ATPase activity and apoptosis in zebrafish larvae. In addition, the swimming behavior of zebrafish larvae decreased with the increase of lincomycin hydrochloride concentration, but the angular velocity and meandering degree increased, which might be due to the decreased activity of AChE and ATPase, as well as the decreased expression of genes related to neurodevelopment and neurotransmitter system, leading to the change of their motor behaviors. In summary, we found that lincomycin hydrochloride induced developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae, contributing to a more comprehensive evaluation of the safety of the drug. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Flame retardant performance of carbonaceous nanomaterials on polyester fabric
AB  - Flame retardants (FRs) are applied to select consumer products such as baby clothing, construction materials, electronics and furniture upholstery to slow or prevent fire ignition or growth by physical/chemical mechanisms. The most commonly used FRs have historically been halogenated molecules. However, their bioaccumulation in mammals has been investigated, leading to some of them to be banned. As an alternative FR, this study investigated the potential of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs) such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) coating material on polyester fabric. CNMs mass loadings on fabrics were verified by programmed thermal analysis (PTA) and tested for flame retardancy using a new assessment approach based on National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) method 705. Compared with traditional FRs, select CNMs showed similar flame retardancy at lower mass loadings. The oxygen content of CNMs, as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), emerged as a critical parameter with higher oxygen content resulting in reduced flame retardancy of the coating. Non nano-sized carbonaceous materials such a carbon black did not exhibit the same flame retardant properties as CNMs. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and amine functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (e.g., NH2-MWCNT) required significantly lower mass loadings to achieve flame retardancy similar to traditional FRs and hence are promising alternatives that warrant further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Development of a modified three-day t-maze protocol for evaluating learning and memory capacity of adult Zebrafish
AB  - A T-maze test is an experimental approach that is used in congenital research. However, the food reward-based protocol for the T-maze test in fish has low efficiency and a long training period. The aim of this study is to facilitate the T-maze conditions by using a combination of the principles of passive avoidance and a spatial memory test. In our modified T-maze settings, electric shock punishment (1–2 V, 0.3–0.5 mA) is given at the left arm, with a green cue at the right arm. Also, the depth of both arms of the T-maze was increased. The parameters measured in our T-maze design were latency, freezing time, and time spent in different areas of the T-maze. We validated the utility of our modified T-maze protocol by showing the consistent finding of memory impairment in ZnCl2−treated fish, which has been previously detected with the passive avoidance test. In addition, we also tested the spatial memory performance of leptin a (lepa) mutants which displayed an obesity phenotype. The results showed that although the learning and memory performance for lepa KO fish were similar to control fish, they displayed a higher freezing behavior during the training phase. In conclusion, we have established a modified T-maze protocol that can be used to evaluate the anxiety, learning, and memory capacity of adult zebrafish within three days, for the first time. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Distributions, influencing factors, and risk assessment of Dechlorane Plus and related compounds in surficial water and sediment from the Jiulong River Estuary, Southeast China
AB  - Dechloranes, a type of additive polychlorinated flame retardant, which include Dechlorane (Dec) Plus (DP), Dec 602, Dec 603, and Dec 604, were detected in surficial water and sediment from the Jiulong River Estuary (JRE). The total concentration of dechloranes in the water and sediments ranged from 1.4 to 4.1 ng/L and 9.3 to 36.2 ng/g dry weight, respectively. The distribution patterns of dechloranes in the water and sediments were both dominated by DP. The average values of the anti-DP fractional abundances (fanti) in the water and sediment samples both were fell in the range of commercial DP mixtures. The relationships of DP in the water with suspended particulate matter (SPM), total organic carbon (TOC), and tides indicated that the combined actions of these environmental factors influenced the distribution of DP in the JRE. The deleterious risk associated with exposure to dechloranes via the water for adults was very low, suggesting that exposure of the local population of dechloranes via water is relatively safe in the JRE. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Effects of 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether on neurobehavior and memory change and bcl-2, c-fos, grin1b and lingo1b gene expression in male zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent organic pollutants in various environmental matrices and organisms and pose a threat to neural systems of organisms. However, though quite a few studies have explored the effect of PBDEs on neural behaviors such as learning and memory abilities in animals, their mechanisms are less known. We used the zebrafish model to evaluate neurotoxicity of PBDEs and observe changes in behavior and related gene expression. In behavioral testing, 50 zebrafish were divided into five groups treated with different concentrations of BDE-47. T-maze exploration was used for learning and memory testing, which was recorded by camera every 7 days. After 21 days, all fish were killed, and the gene expression of c-fos, bcl-2, lingo1b and grin1b in brain tissue was analyzed by RT-qPCR. The behavioral changes (latency to leave the start zone, reach the reward zone, and stay in the reward zone; accuracy in choosing the right maze arm, accumulation of freezing bouts, etc.) were related to BDE-47 concentration and had a time–effect relation with increasing exposure days, especially with 500 μg/L BDE-47. BDE-47 elevated brain bcl-2, grin1b and lingo1b expression. The expression of c-fos showed an increase with 50 and 100 μg/L BDE-47 exposure. The PBDE BDE-47 had a negative impact on the neurobehaviors of zebrafish and affected the expression of c-fos, bcl-2, lingo1b and grin1b in zebrafish brain tissue. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Atmospheric Occurrence of Organochlorine Pesticides and Inhalation Cancer Risk in Urban Areas at Southeast Brazil
AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been produced for almost a century and some of them are still used, even after they have been proved to be toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative and prone to long-range transport. Brazil has used and produced pesticides in industrial scales for both agricultural and public health purposes. Urban and industrial regions are of special concern due to their high population density and their increased exposure to chemical pollution, many times enhanced by chemical production, application or irregular dumping. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of OCPs in outdoor air of urban sites from two major regions of southeast Brazil. Some of these sites have been affected by OCP production and their irregular dumping. Deterministic and probabilistic inhalation cancer risk (CR) assessments were conducted for the human populations exposed to OCPs in ambient air. Ambient air was mainly affected by Ʃ-HCH (median = 340 pg m−3) and Ʃ-DDT (median = 233 pg m−3), the only two OCPs registered for domissanitary purposes in Brazil. OCP concentrations tended to be higher in summer than in winter. Dumping sites resulted in the highest OCP atmospheric concentrations and, thus, in the highest CR estimations. Despite of all limitations, probabilistic simulations suggested that people living in the studied regions are exposed to an increased risk of hepatic cancer. Infants and toddlers (0 &lt; 2 y) were exposed to the highest inhalation CRs compared to other age groups. Other exposure pathways (such as ingestion and dermic uptake) are needed for a more comprehensive risk assessment. Moreover, this study also highlights the need to review the human exposure to OCPs through inhalation and their respective CR in other impacted areas worldwide, especially where high levels of OCPs are still being measured. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Tributyltin enhanced anxiety of adult male zebrafish through elevating cortisol level and disruption in serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter pathways
AB  - Tributyltin (TBT), a widely and persistently distributed organontin, has been well documented to disrupt reproduction and behaviors in animals due to its anti-aromatase activity. TBT has been also reported to enhance anxiety in several fish species, whereas the mechanism underlying remains largely unknown. To investigate the disruption of TBT on fish anxiety and the mechanisms possibly involved, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with TBT (100 and 500 ng/L) for 28 days and anxiety behavior was further investigated using a novel tank dive test. Result showed that TBT treatment significantly enhanced the total time of the fish spent in the lower half, delayed the onset time to the higher half of the tank and increased the total duration of freezing of the fish, indicating an enhanced anxiety in TBT-treated fish. Accordingly, TBT sharply elevated the cortisol levels in plasma in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated cortisol level might be involved in the enhanced anxiety. Although the expression of crha was significantly increased and crhbp was significantly decreased in the brain of TBT-treated fish which is consistent to the elevated cortisol level, the expressions of actha and acthb were sharply down-regulated. In contrast, the expressions of genes responsible for the synthesis and action of serotonin (5-HT) (pet1, thp2 and htr1aa), dopamine (DA) (th1, slc6a3, drd2a and drd2b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (gad2 and gabrg2) were all significantly inhibited. The down-regulation of these pivotal genes acting in 5-HT, DA and GABA neurotransmitter systems in response to TBT corresponded well with the TBT-enhanced anxiety in fish. It was thus strongly suggested that these neurotransmitters might be also involved in TBT-enhanced anxiety in adult male zebrafish. The present study extended our understanding of the neurotoxicity of TBT on the anxiety control and behavioral modulation in fish. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - How microplastic components influence the immune system and impact on children health: Focus on cancer
AB  - Background: As a result of human socioeconomic activity, industrial wastes have increased distressingly. Plastic pollution is globally distributed across the world due to its properties of buoyancy and durability. A big health hazard is the sorption of toxicants to plastic while traveling through the environment. Two broad classes of plastic-related chemicals are of critical concern for human health—bisphenols and phthalates. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disruptor compound (EDC) with estrogenic activity. It is used in the production of materials that are used daily. The endocrine modulating activity of BPA and its effects on reproductive health has been widely studied. BPA also has effects on the immune system; however, they are poorly investigated and the available data are inconclusive. Phthalates are also EDCs used as plasticizers in a wide array of daily-use products. Since these compounds are not covalently bound to the plastic matrix, they easily leach out from it, leading to high human exposure. These compounds exert several cell effects through modulating different endocrine pathways, such as estrogen, androgen, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and arylhydrocarbon receptor pathways. The exposure to both classes of plastic derivatives during critical periods has detrimental effects on human health. Methods: In this review, we have compiled the most important of their perinatal effects on the function of the immune system and their relationship to the development of different types of cancer. Results/Conclusion: The administration of bisphenols and phthalates during critical stages of development affects important immune system components, and the immune function; which might be related to the development of different diseases including cancer. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - Influence of 3-nitropropionic acid on physiological and behavioral responses in zebrafish larvae and adults
AB  - Long-term treatment with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), a toxin derived from plants and fungi, may reproduce symptoms and biochemical characteristics of Huntington's disease (HD). Our study evaluated the effects of 3-NPA on the physiological and behavioral responses in zebrafish larvae and adults. Larvae exposed to 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 mM 3-NPA exhibited an increase in heart rate at 2- and 5-days post-fertilization (dpf). There was a decrease in the ocular distance at 5 dpf with 0.05 mM 3-NPA treatment. However, 3-NPA did not alter larval locomotor parameters. Adult zebrafish received 3-NPA intraperitoneal injections (a total of seven injections at doses 10, 20, or 60 mg/kg every 96 h) and showed a decrease in body weight, locomotion and aggressive behavior. No changes were observed in anxiety-like behavior and social interaction between 3-NPA-exposed animals and control groups. However, 3-NPA-treated animals (at 60 mg/kg) demonstrated impaired long-term aversive memory. Overall, 3-NPA exposure induced morphological and heart rate alterations in zebrafish larvae. Additionally, our study showed behavioral changes in zebrafish that were submitted to long-term 3-NPA treatment, which could be related to HD symptoms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Exposure to teflubenzuron negatively impacts exploratory behavior, learning and activity of juvenile European lobster (Homarus gammarus)
AB  - Infestations with salmon lice, a parasitic copepod, is a major problem in the salmon farming industry. Teflubenzuron is an in-feed pharmaceutical applied to control lice outbreaks; the standard medication is 10 mg per kg fish per day for seven days. Surveys reveal that teflubenzuron accumulates and persists in the sediment around fish farms and causes deformities and mortality in juvenile European lobster (Homarus gammarus), a species commonly found in the vicinity of salmon farms in Norway. To date, there is no information on sub-lethal effects of teflubenzuron on, for example, behavior. We conducted an experiment to assess possible difference in the shelter seeking behavior of teflubenzuron-exposed (N = 19) vs. not exposed (N = 19) H. gammarus juveniles. The teflubenzuron-exposed juveniles had been given very low concentrations, 1.7 µg per pellet twice per week for 113 days prior to this experiment. The concentration of teflubenzuron was estimated to be less than 1 ng/g lobster when they were tested in the behavior experiment. Animals were placed in a lane with a shelter at one end. Once a lobster had found and entered the shelter, they were repeatedly displaced back to the opposite end of the lane, for a total of 3 repeated runs per animal. Three of the exposed juveniles failed to settle in the shelter, and the remaining teflubenzuron-exposed animals took significantly more time to explore the environment and to find and recognize shelter. Furthermore, exposed lobsters also exhibited slower walking speed compared to the controls. These results demonstrate that teflubenzuron significantly reduces exploratory behavior, learning and activity of juvenile H. gammarus. Thus, exposure to teflubenzuron could increase predation mortality of juvenile lobsters in the wild. © 2018

TI  - An automated Y-maze based on a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microcontroller for the assessment of continuous spontaneous alternation in rats
AB  - Continuous spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) in a Y-maze is used for evaluating working memory in rodents. Here, the design of an automated Y-maze equipped with three infrared optocouplers per arm, and commanded by a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microcontroller is described. The software was devised for recording only true entries and exits to the arms. Experimental settings are programmed via a keyboard with three buttons and a display. The sequence of arm entries and the time spent in each arm and the neutral zone (NZ) are saved as a text file in a non-volatile memory for later transfer to a USB flash memory. Data files are analyzed with a program developed under LabVIEW® environment, and the results are exported to an Excel® spreadsheet file. Variables measured are: latency to exit the starting arm, sequence and number of arm entries, number of alternations, alternation percentage, and cumulative times spent in each arm and NZ. The automated Y-maze accurately detected the SAB decrease produced in rats by the muscarinic antagonist trihexyphenidyl, and its reversal by caffeine, having 100 % concordance with the alternation percentages calculated by two trained observers who independently watched videos of the same experiments. Although the values of time spent in the arms and NZ measured by the automated system had small discrepancies with those calculated by the observers, Bland-Altman analysis showed 95 % concordance in three pairs of comparisons, while in one it was 90 %, indicating that this system is a reliable and inexpensive alternative for the study of continuous SAB in rodents. © 2015, Psychonomic Society, Inc.

TI  - Benzo[a]pyrene exposure and overcrowding stress impacts anxiety-like behavior and impairs learning and memory in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio
AB  - Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a prototype of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ubiquitous environmental pollutant, alters neurobehavioral responses in aquatic organisms like zebrafish. Increasing organic load on water bodies causes population explosion leading to overcrowding (OC) stress. The effect of OC stress on neurobehavioral alterations remains unclear. The objective of our study is to elucidate the impact of OC stress on behavioral alterations and neurodegenerative phenotypes on exposure to B[a]P in zebrafish. We demonstrate the effects of OC stress (12 fish/L) on acute waterborne exposure to B[a]P (0.2 mg L−1) in adult wild zebrafish. Anxiety-like behavior, learning, and memory impairment were assayed by novel tank diving test, light/dark preference test, and T-maze test. Oxidative stress bio-markers were assayed along with histopathological changes in zebrafish brain. OC stress significantly impaired the learning ability and mood behavior by increasing the number of transition and time spent in the alter zones. Increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation with significant decreased catalase activity and reduced glutathione level showed oxidative stress on exposure to OC stress and B[a]P. Pyknotic neuronal counts dramatically increased in periventricular grey zone of optic tectum brain region of zebrafish. Our findings showed that OC stress modulates the B[a]P-induced behavioral alterations causing learning and memory deficiency with histopathological changes in adult zebrafish brain. OC stress may act as an early risk factor for the eventual development of cognitive impairments and B[a]P exposure plays a key role in mediating both the facilitating and impairing actions of OC stress in memory processes. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - Tryptophan alleviates neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress in zebrafish
AB  - Stressful experiences are related to the triggering of anxiety and mood disorders. Tryptophan (amino acid precursor of serotonin synthesis) emerges as important treatment of these disorders. Here, we evaluate the effects of pre-treatment with tryptophan (300 mg/L) and fluoxetine (50 μg/L) in response to acute stress in zebrafish. Overall, acute stress decreased the distance traveled, entries and time in top of tank, as well as increased the cortisol levels, demonstrating an anxiogenic behavior. Tryptophan and fluoxetine prevented anxiogenic effects. This study showed the importance of tryptophan and fluoxetine in the regulation of stress and anxiety-like behavior in adult zebrafish. Collectively, our data support tryptophan effects on stress responses in zebrafish and reinforce the growing utility of this aquatic model to screen CNS therapies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Accumulation and distribution of neurotoxin BMAA in aquatic animals and effect on the behavior of zebrafish in a T-maze test
AB  - Neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been widely detected in diverse aquatic organisms within different ecosystem trophic levels in recent years. It was the goal of this study to investigate the accumulation and tissue distribution of BMAA in marine opossum shrimp (Neomysis awatschensis) and freshwater zebrafish (Danio rerio) in exposure experiments. A T-maze test was tentatively adopted to assess the effects of BMAA on the learning and memory ability of zebrafish. Interestingly, N. awatschensis was testified to be capable of accumulating free soluble BMAA from bathing seawater through a biological filtration pathway (max. 110.6 μg g−1 wet weight). BMAA was transferred quickly from viscus to muscle and head tissues of zebrafish after intraperitoneal administration of 16.3 μg BMAA per individual twice in two weeks. BMAA accumulated mainly as the total soluble form in both experimental organisms. Results do not support the hypothesis that free BMAA molecules can be largely incorporated into protein in aquatic animals. Behavior of zebrafish in the T-maze test demonstrated that the short-term learning and memory ability was negatively impacted to some degree after three-days exposure to BMAA. Moreover, on Day 3, certain individual zebrafish exhibited freezing and loitering behavior. However, further investigation will be required to discern the long-term effects of BMAA on animals in order to evaluate the risk of BMAA exposure to human health. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy is a life-threatening manifestation of individuals with urea cycle disorders, which is associated with high mortality rates and severe neurological sequelae in survivors. Cerebral bioenergetic failure has been proposed as one of the key mechanisms underlying hyperammonemia-induced brain damage, but data supporting this hypothesis remain inconclusive and partially contradictory. Using a previously established zebrafish model of acute hyperammonemic decompensation, we unraveled that acute hyperammonemia leads to a transamination-dependent withdrawal of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with consecutive TCA cycle dysfunction, ultimately causing impaired oxidative phosphorylation with ATP shortage, decreased ATP/ADP-ratio and elevated lactate concentrations. Thus, our study supports and extends the hypothesis that cerebral bioenergetic dysfunction is an important pathophysiological hallmark of hyperammonemia-induced neurotoxicity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - 17-α-Ethinylestradiol modulates endocrine and behavioral responses to stress in zebrafish
AB  - The synthetic estrogen, 17-α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), present in contraceptive pills, is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that can be found in the aquatic environment. We examined the impacts of EE2 on zebrafish behavioral and physiological responses through the novel tank test (NTT), which measures anxiety-like behavior; the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test, which measures aggressiveness; and the social preference test (SPT), which measures social cohesion. The steroid hormone levels were also measured. Here, we show that exposure to EE2 impairs stress responses by regulating the levels of specific hormones and eliciting an anxiolytic response, increasing aggression, and reducing social preference in zebrafish. In nature, these changes in behavior compromise reproduction and anti-predator behaviors, which, in turn, affects species survival. The maintenance of an intact behavioral repertoire in zebrafish is essential for their survival. Thus, our results point to the danger of environmental contamination with EE2 as it may alter the dynamics of the prey–predator relationship. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos induces sex-specific airway hyperreactivity in adult rats
AB  - Occupational and environmental exposures to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are associated with increased incidence of asthma and other pulmonary diseases. Although the canonical mechanism of OP neurotoxicity is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), it was previously reported that the OP chlorpyrifos (CPF) causes airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in Guinea pigs at levels that do not inhibit lung or brain AChE. The Guinea pig is considered to have inherently hyperresponsive airways, thus, cross-species validation is needed to confirm relevance to humans. Additionally, sex differences in asthma incidence have been demonstrated in the human population, but whether OP-induced AHR is sexdependent has not been systematically studied in a preclinical model. In this study, 8-week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered CPF at doses causing comparable AChE inhibition in whole lung homogenate (30 mg/kg in males, 7 mg/kg in females, sc) prior to assessing pulmonary mechanics in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d or 14 d post-exposure in males, and 24h or 7 d post-exposure in females. CPF significantly potentiated vagally induced airway resistance and tissue elastance at 7 d post-exposure in males, and at 24h and 7 d postexposure in females. These effects occurred independent of significant AChE inhibition in cerebellum, blood, trachealis, or isolated airway, suggesting that AChE independent OP-induced airway hyperreactivity is a cross-species phenomenon. These findings have significant implications for assessing the risk posed by CPF, and potentially other OPs, to human health and safety. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - A peptide derived from acetylcholinesterase is a pivotal signalling molecule in neurodegeneration
AB  - It is now widely accepted that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) also displays non-cholinergic functions, completely independent of cholinergic transmission. Indeed, AChE has been implicated in a variety of trophic and toxic actions in a range of different systems. However, it is still uncertain what part of the AChE molecule may be responsible for these actions, and indeed via what receptor. Recent work has identified a peptide towards the C-terminus of the AChE molecule that appears to have very similar effects to non-cholinergic AChE itself. This action is to enhance calcium entry, in acute and chronic preparations across a trophic-toxic spectrum, depending on concentration applied and/or duration of exposure. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Chronic unpredictable early-life stress (CUELS) protocol: Early-life stress changes anxiety levels of adult zebrafish
AB  - Early-life stress can lead to two different behavioral responses: (1) increased susceptibility to psychiatric disorders or (2) resilience. Here, we created a chronic unpredictable early-life stress (CUELS) protocol to assess the effects of early experiences in adult zebrafish. Animals were exposed to mild stressors twice a day and the duration was varied between groups (0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of stress). The stressor consisted of light/dark cycle changes; social isolation; overcrowding; water changes; water cooling; mechanical stirring; water heating; and immersion in shallow water. Behavior was assessed at young stages (21 days post-fertilization – open field analysis) and adulthood (4-months-old - novel tank diving test, light/dark task, shoaling, free movement pattern Y-maze and Pavlovian fear conditioning). Cortisol levels were assessed to evaluate the impact of CUELS in the HPI axis. Zebrafish exposed to 7 days of CUELS showed a decreased anxiety-like phenotype in two behavioral tasks, presenting increased time spent in top and decreased time spent in the dark area. Animals exposed to 14 days of CUELS showed an opposite anxious phenotype compared to 3 and 7 days of CUELS. No significant changes were observed in memory and cognition, social behavior and cortisol levels. In general, 7 days of CUELS protocol decreased anxiety in young and adult zebrafish, and could be used to understand the mechanisms underlying early-life experiences-derived alterations in neural circuits of anxiety. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Involvement of dopamine signaling pathway in neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by isoniazid in zebrafish
AB  - Aims: This study evaluated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of isoniazid (INH) in zebrafish embryos and the underlying mechanism. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations (2 mM, 4 mM, 8 mM, 16 mM, 32 mM) INH for 120 hpf. During the exposure period, the percentage of embryo/larva mortality, hatching, and morphological malformation were checked every 24 h until 120 hpf. The development of blood vessels in the brain was observed at 72 hpf and 120 hpf, and behavioral capacity and acridine orange (AO) staining were measured at 120 hpf. Alterations in the mRNA expression of apoptosis and dopamine signaling pathway related genes were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: INH considerably inhibited zebrafish embryo hatching and caused zebrafish larval malformation (such as brain malformation, delayed yolk sac absorption, spinal curvature, pericardial edema, and swim bladder defects). High concentration of INH (16 mM, 32 mM) even induced death of zebrafish. In addition, INH exposure markedly restrained the ability of the zebrafish autonomous movement, shortened the length of dopamine neurons and inhibited vascular development in the brain. No obvious apoptotic cells were observed in the control group, whereas considerable numbers of apoptotic cells appeared in the head of INH-treated larvae at 120 hpf. PCR results indicated that INH significantly raised the transcription levels of caspase-3, -8, -9, and bax and significantly decreased bcl-2 and bcl-2/bax in the zebrafish apoptotic signaling pathway. INH also markedly decreased the genes related to dopamine signaling pathway (th1, dat, drd1, drd2a, drd3, and drd4b). Conclusions: Experimental results indicated that INH had obvious neurodevelopmental toxicity in zebrafish. Persistent exposure to INH for 120 h caused apoptosis, decreased dopaminergic gene expression, altered vasculature, and reduced behaviors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ethanol affects behavior and HPA axis activity during development in zebrafish larvae
AB  - Recent studies have shown that long-term alcohol intake from food can lead to numerous mental disorders in humans, and the social and health effects of excessive intake of alcohol currently represent serious problems for governments and families worldwide. However, to date, it has not been determined how alcohol affects the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The zebrafish offers a good model for studying the toxicology of food-grade ethanol. In the present study, using zebrafish larvae exposed to 1% ethanol, we performed zebrafish behavioral analysis. Samples were collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments, and statistical analysis was performed. We found that ethanol decreased the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae, which showed a more intense reaction to external stimuli. Ethanol also increased the level of HPA axis hormones in zebrafish larvae, influenced the level of neurotransmitters, and altered the expression of key genes in neurotransmitter metabolism. Ethanol exposure affects zebrafish behavior, increases the level of HPA axis hormones in zebrafish larvae, affects the level of neurotransmitters, and affects the expression of key genes in dopamine and serotonin metabolism. These findings may help to elucidate the effects of ethanol on HPA axis activity. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Simultaneous quantitative detection of 10 phthalates in PVC children’s toys by HPLC-PDA
AB  - A high-performance chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-PAD) method has been developed and validated for the identification and quantification of ten phthalates; diethyl phthalate (DEP), diallyl phthalate (DAP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), dihexyl phthalate (DHP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) in children’s PVC toys. The phthalates were extracted from PVC toy sample using ultrasonic extraction with methanol. Quantification analysis was achieved by gradient elution mode using reversed-phase ODS-4 C18 column with PAD detection at 226 nm. The method has been validated for (BBP, DOP, DINP, and DIDP) and (DEP, DAP, DBP, DCHP, DHP, and DEHP) in the concentration range of 1–100 and 2–200 mg L−1, respectively. The accuracy determined as recovery were 82.85–107.40% with RSD values at 0.8–4.2%. The limits of detection for (DEP, DAP, BBP, DBP, DCHP, DHP, DEHP, DOP, DINP, and DIDP) were 0.02, 0.04, 0.01, 0.03, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.01, 0.08, and 0.10 mg L−1, respectively. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Semi-volatile organic pollutants in Jordanian surface water
AB  - Jordan relies heavily on rainwater stored in reservoirs because it has extremely limited alternative water resources. These reservoirs are essential for drinking water and irrigation, so monitoring their water quality is extremely important. In this study we monitored 55 semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) in monthly samples from the Zarqa River and three reservoirs between April and August 2010, and also screened the samples for non-target pollutants. Twelve SVOCs were detected and quantified at King Talal Dam followed by ten at Zarqa River and four each at Wadi Al-Arab and Mujib dams. Phenol and phthalate esters were detected at wide range concentrations (0.01–25 μg/L) in all water samples. Phenol has the highest level at the Zarqa River (18.5 ± 5.5 μg/L) followed by King Talal (12.5 ± 2.5 μg/L) and Wadi Al-Arab (2.5 ± 0.63 μg/L). Phthalate esters (total) were detected at the Zarqa River, King Talal, Wadi Al-Arab, and Mujib dams at levels 3.85, 3.75, 1.03 and 0.12 μg/L. Other contaminants, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were detected at low concentrations in the King Talal Dam reservoir and Zarqa River samples. Two non-targeted phosphate plasticizers, tri-n-butylphosphate and tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate were identified in the July and August Zarqa River samples. A comparison study reveals that SVOC pollution of surface water in Jordan is within acceptable international limits, but long-term monitoring programs should be implemented. © 2014 King Saud University

TI  - Neurotrophins and cholinergic enzyme regulated by calpain-2: New insights into neuronal apoptosis induced by polybrominated diphenyl ether-153
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ether-153 (BDE-153) has been demonstrated to induce neuronal apoptosis in rat cerebral cortex and primary neurons. Neurotrophins and cholinergic enzymes play critical roles in the neuronal survival, maintenance, synaptic plasticity and learning memory, however, their roles in neuronal apoptosis following the BDE-153 treatment remain unclear. In this study, we firstly explored the possible predominant pathway underlying the neuronal apoptotic induced by the BDE-153 treatment in rat cerebral cortex, by measuring expression levels (mRNA and protein) of p53, caspase-3, 8, 9, calpain-1, and calpain-2, detected the levels (protein contents and mRNA) of neurotrophins including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), and measured acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChaT) activities in rat cerebral cortex and primary neurons following BDE-153 treatment with or without pretreatment with inhibitors. Results showed that the neuronal apoptosis induced by BDE-153 was dependent on p53, and dependent on more calpain-2 than caspase-3 in the cerebral cortex of rats. Following the BDE-153 treatment, the protein contents and mRNA levels of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-4, as well as the AchE and ChaT activities were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex and primary neurons when compared to the untreated group. When pretreated primary neurons with calpain inhibitor PD150606 or cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk5, the downstream complex of calpain) inhibitor Roscovitine, the neurotrophins contents and activities of ChaT and AchE were reverted, along with the improvement of neuron survival compared with BDE-153 treatment alone. We conclude that neurotrophins and cholinergic enzymes were regulated by the calpain-2 activation and its downstream cdk5 pathway, and which was involved in the neuronal apoptosis induced by the BDE-153 treatment. © 2018

TI  - Menopause and menarche in patients with primary blepharospasm: An exploratory case-control study
AB  - We studied the relationships between blepharospasm (BSP) and menopause/menarche in female patients with primary BSP (n = 83) and age-matched healthy (n = 83) and disease controls (n = 83). BSP patients and matched controls had comparable age at menopause, and there was no correlation between age at menopause and age at BSP onset. Thus, menopause probably exerts no significant influence on the age-dependent development of BSP. BSP cases tended to have a later menarche than either group of controls. The association was independent of age, disease duration and education level. Because the higher the age at menarche, the higher the age at BSP onset, later menarche was unlikely to be a risk factor for BSP. Rather, the two conditions may share pathophysiologic mechanisms, for example minor abnormality of neurotransmitter systems controlling both the motor system and the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis responsible for the onset of puberty.

TI  - Uptake, depuration, bioaccumulation, and selective enrichment of dechlorane plus in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)
AB  - Dechlorane plus (DP) is a chlorinated flame retardant with high production volume (HPV) and is widely used in our daily necessities. In the present study, a laboratory-scale microcosm was built up to simulate the uptake, depuration, bioaccumulation, and stereoselective enrichment of DP in a lower concentration and equilibration condition. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were used for 32 days exposure and 32 days depuration. The concentration ratios of syn-DP to total DP (fsyn values) in fish examined were lower than that in commercial products. Rate constants of uptake (kS) and elimination (ke) for the syn- and anti-DP were calculated using a first-order kinetic model. The uptake rate constants of syn- and anti-DP were 0.63 and 0.89 day−1, respectively. The depuration rate constants of syn-DP (0.11 day−1) were similar to anti-DP (0.096 day−1), suggesting that anti-DP is absorbed faster than syn-DP by common carp. The estimated bioconcentration factors for both syn-DP (5700 L/kg) and anti-DP (9300 L/kg) were higher than the bioconcentration hazard criteria outlined in the Stockholm Convention, suggesting the bioconcentration potential to aquatic organisms for DP. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo-larvae locomotor activity data analysis: Evaluating anxiolytic effects of the antidepressant compound citalopram
AB  - Newly fertilized zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to increasing concentrations of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram from fertilization until six days post-fertilization (dpf). Locomotor activity data were acquired at six dpf using an automated ZebraBox® infrared tracking system. Individual (n = 32) locomotor activity was recorded during 75 minutes in total during alternating illumination conditions (0% light, i.e. dark periods, and 100% light, i.e. light periods). The first 15 minutes of the test consisted of a dark period, i.e an acclimatization phase. Afterward, six alternating light and dark periods were conducted. Individual zebrafish embryo-larvae locomotion was tracked and aggregated in ten-second bins. The dataset, containing nine locomotor-related quantified endpoints (factors), was parsed, analyzed, and visualized using R software. The dataset and its associated custom R script may be used to further explore locomotor activity outcomes (e.g. anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties) following exposure to citalopram or other neuroactive chemicals. © 2019 The Author(s)

TI  - Ethanolamine produced from oleoylethanolamide degradation contributes to acetylcholine/dopamine balance modulating eating behavior
AB  - Oleoylethanolamide is a well-recognized anorectic compound which also has noteworthy effects on food-reward, influencing the acetylcholine (ACh)/dopamine (DA) balance in the cholinergic system. After its administration, oleoylethanolamide is quickly degraded into oleic acid and ethanolamine. The effect of oleic acid on the gut-brain axis has been extensively investigated, whereas ethanolamine has received scarce attention. However, there is scattered evidence from old and recent research that has underlined the influence of ethanolamine on the cholinergic system. In the present article, we propose a model by which the released ethanolamine contributes to the overall balance between DA and ACh after oleoylethanolamide administration. © 2019 American Society for Nutrition.

N1  - <p>Les organophosphorés (OPs) sont des composés organiques qui inhibent l’acétylcholinesterase (AChE). Cette enzyme est essentielle pour mettre fin à la transmission synaptique au niveau des jonctions neuro-musculaires, et entre les neurones cérébraux au niveau des synapses cholinergiques. L’inhibition de l’AChE par les OPs peut causer une multitude de symptômes périphériques et centraux, qui peuvent notamment se traduire par des paralysies, des atteintes pulmonaires, des convulsions ou des crises d’épilepsie. Si ces crises ne sont pas rapidement traitées, elles peuvent s’aggraver et aboutir à un état de mal épileptique, plus difficile à traiter. De plus, la dégradation du complexe AChE-OP rend la réactivation de l’enzyme impossible. Ainsi, de par leur utilisation largement généralisée en tant que pesticides mais aussi comme armes chimiques lors d’attaques terroristes par exemple, et des difficultés à traiter les conséquences d’une intoxication, les OPs représentent un réel danger de santé publique. Il apparaît donc essentiel de trouver de nouvelles cibles thérapeutiques pour améliorer le traitement des intoxications chroniques et aiguës aux OPs.Les cellules microgliales, macrophages résidents du cerveau, ont longtemps été considérées comme de simples macrophages. Cependant, les études de ces dernières décennies ont permis de mettre en lumière leurs fonctions bien plus diverses et essentielles que ce qu’il était initialement pensé. Ainsi, il apparaît aujourd’hui que la microglie est indispensable au développement et à la maturation du cerveau, et remplit des fonctions variées tout au long de la vie d’un individu. Des études suggèrent d’ailleurs que ces cellules auraient un rôle dans le déclenchement et l’aggravation de crises d’épilepsie.Le but de ma thèse était d’étudier les cellules microgliales dans un contexte d’intoxication à un OP, afin de mieux comprendre les mécanismes microgliaux mis en jeu suite à cette intoxication et ainsi de trouver de nouvelles voies thérapeutiques.

N1  - <p>Université d’Ottawa / University of Ottawa ; Chemical-induced models have revealed the crucial role of oxidative stress and mito-chondrial dysfunction in the development of Parkinson’s Disease. In this project, firstly, we in-vestigated the mechanism of action of rotenone, a commercialized pesticide that was previously described to reproduce the bradykinetic dopaminergic neurodegeneration symptoms of Parkin-son’s Disease in zebrafish by inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I. We found out that rote-none caused change in the morphology of the zebrafish dopaminergic mitochondrial network. We also observed the altered expression of various genes involves in mitochondrial fusion and fission in response to rotenone exposure. Secondly, to develop the use of adult zebrafish as a toxin-based model for Parkinson’s Disease, we sought to minimize any off-target effects by exposure of rotenone specifically to the brain. We demonstrated that microinjection of rotenone into the forebrain ventricular zone of adult zebrafish decreases the number of dopaminergic neurons. However, behavioural tests suggested that did not translate into locomotor impairment in these fish. Taken together, these results gave us more information about the potential use of zebrafish to study the physiological mechanism leading to dopaminergic degeneration and allow for the development of therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s Disease.</p>

N1  - <p>Human population is constantly exposed to health risks by exposure to chemicals belonging to various classes such as pesticides, pollutants and chemicals used in agriculture, food industries etc. It is important to keep use of such chemicals under continuous observation and their effects must be re-evaluated in the light of changing conditions of use and new scientific information (Council directive 89/107/EEC). Major part of my thesis is focused on investigating toxic effects and mechanisms of action of one such environmental pollutant, glyphosate, a non-selective herbicide. In this thesis, mechanistic toxicology of sodium benzoate (SB), a common food preservative, has also been investigated. I have used zebrafish vertebrate animal model for toxicity studies included in my thesis and therefore I have also established a zebrafish research lab at IITH. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide. Results included in my thesis indicate significant acute toxicity in zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate concentrations 50 µg/mL and above. LD50 for glyphosate was calculated to be 66.04 ± 4.6 µg/mL after 48 hours of exposure. Developmental toxicity due to glyphosate was also observed as physical malformations in zebrafish embryos such as yolk sac edema, pericardial edema, body bending and eye defects. Glyphosate induced cardiotoxicity above 50 µg/mL concentrations as indicated by reduced heartbeat of zebrafish embryos in a dose and time dependent manner. To analyze heartbeat, we developed a simple yet powerful method of heartbeat analysis from the untethered, unanesthetized and unlabeled zebrafish larva using ImageJ (open-source) software. We named our semi-automatic method as ZebraPace for Zebrafish Precise Algorithm for Cardiac-rhythm Estimation. Our method is truly cost-effective, uses algorithm which involves fewer steps without the requirement of cumbersome image processing and programming steps. It is also highly reproducible across researchers. The decrease in the heartbeat of zebrafish embryos upon exposure to glyphosate was accompanied by a reduction in the gene expression of cacna1c (L-type calcium channel) and ryr2a (Ryanodine receptor) indicating alterations in the proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and calcium signaling. A change in calcium signaling upon glyphosate exposure was also evident by the upregulation of hspb11 gene (heat shock protein) in our experiments. Of note, hspb11 has been used as a marker to detect changes in cytosolic calcium. Therefore, taken together our results indicate that glyphosate may be inducing cardiotoxicity by changes in calcium signaling. In addition, in our experiments, glyphosate reduced the generation of nitric oxide (NO). NO signaling and calcium signaling are tightly linked and any alteration in one will lead to changes in the other. Glyphosate exposure to adult zebrafish resulted in a reduced reproduction potential indicated by less number of successful mating between treated zebrafish. We observed developmental defects and cardiotoxicity in the progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to glyphosate at a concentration of 10 µg/mL. It is important to note that, the obtained progeny was not exposed to glyphosate. Taken together, these results indicate that glyphosate induced toxicity can be carried to the next generation. Swimming behaviour was also affected in adult zebrafish exposed to glyphosate at a concentration of 10 µg/mL. The speed of swimming was increased which was interrupted with long durations of freezing in between as compared to control adult fishes. Treated adult zebrafish also showed anxiety-like behaviour as indicated by reduced exploration of the center of the open field test tank. I have also investigated mechanistic toxicology of SB. Results included in my thesis indicate that SB induced biochemical (oxidative stress) and behavioural (anxiety-like behaviour) abnormalities in developing zebrafish larva. LD50 of SB induced toxicity was approximately 400 ppm after 48 hours of SB exposure. Our data strongly supports harmful effects of SB at increasing doses and suggests caution in the excessive use of this preservative in processed and convenience foods. Overall, results in my thesis indicate that both glyphosate and SB can cause significant toxicity and we suggest caution in the excessive use of chemicals which have the potential to cause toxicity.</p>

N1  - <p>Université d’Ottawa / University of Ottawa ; Rotenone is a commercially available pesticide with a variety of industrial applications. However, occupational exposure to rotenone has been implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease. To explore the mechanism of dopamine neuron death secondary to rotenone exposure, the zebrafish was used as a live animal screening tool for environmentally-induced Parkinson’s disease. After testing a variety of small molecule compounds on embryonic zebrafish for their potential to cause dopamine neuron loss, we identified that rotenone exposure induces a bradykinetic dopamine neuron loss phenotype. This phenotype was characterized by decreased locomotion, sensory insensitivity, and a transient but marked decrease in the number of dopamine neurons in embryos exposed to 100nM rotenone, with a concomitant decrease in dopamine transporter mRNA levels. The dopamine neuron deficits were observed in the subpallium, pretectum, olfactory bulb, but these losses were most pronounced in the ventral diencephalon after rotenone exposure. Rotenone damages the mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequently induces ROS-mediated apoptosis in these dopamine neurons. The rotenone-induced dopamine neuron loss and locomotion phenotypes could be partially rescued in zebrafish larvae with ascorbic acid co-treatment during rotenone exposure. Adults raised from zebrafish embryos exposed to rotenone did not show any deficits to their dopamine neuron distribution, but did show anxiety-like behaviors and upregulation of dopamine receptor D1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that rotenone exposure can cause dopamine neuron death through ROS- mediated apoptosis, and supports an environmental cause of Parkinson’s disease. ￼La roténone est un pesticide disponible dans le commerce et utilisé pour une variété d’usages industriels. Cependant, l’exposition à la roténone a été impliquée dans le développement de la maladie de Parkinson. Afin d’explorer le mécanisme menant à la perte de neurones dopaminergiques suite à une exposition à la roténone, le poisson-zèbre (Danio rerio) a été utilisée comme modèle animal du développement de la maladie de Parkinson attribuable à des causes environnementales. Après avoir testé une série de petites molécules sur des embryons de poisson-zèbre pour déterminer leur capacité à causer une perte de neurones dopaminergiques, nous avons identifié la roténone comme causant un phénotype de perte de neurones associée à une bradykinésie. Ce phénotype était caractérisé par une perte de la locomotion, une insensibilité sensorielle, et une diminution transitoire mais marquée du nombre de neurones dopaminergiques chez des embryons exposés à une concentration de roténone de 100nM. Ceci coïncidait avec une réduction des niveaux d’expression du gène du transporteur de la dopamine (dat). Des pertes de neurones dopaminergiques furent observés dans le sub-pallium, le pré-tectum et le bulbe olfactif mais étaient plus prononcées dans le diencéphale ventral. La roténone cause des dommages aux mitochondries en générant des dérivés réactifs de l’oxygène (ROS) et, subséquemment, induit une apoptose attribuable aux ROS dans les neurones dopaminergiques. La perte de neurones dopaminergiques due à la roténone ainsi que les déficits locomoteurs ont pu être partiellement empêchés par un co-traitement à l’acide ascorbique.

Ces résultats suggèrent que l’exposition à la roténone peut causer la mort des neurones dopaminergiques via une apoptose médiée par les ROS et pourrait constituer une cause environnemental de la maladie de Parkinson.</p>

Physical, chemical and microbiological parameters (turbidity, temperature, pH, Phosphorus, Total Solids, Filterable Solids, Total Coliforms, E. Coli, COD, conductivity, nitrate, DO, BOD) were analyzed to assess the changes of these characteristics during sampling. There were two sampling campaigns in one rainy season and another in the dry season. Samples were collected at six points in the watercourse Meia Ponte, within the boundaries of the Goiânia. The samples were analyzed by UHPLC at LBGQA (UFScar).The compounds analysed were caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, atenolol, propranolol, triclosan, estrone, 17-β-estradiol, 17αethinylestradiol.

N1  - <p>Background: Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are well-known developmental neurotoxicants that have been linked to abnormal cognitive and behavioral endpoints through both epidemiological studies and animal models of behavioral teratology, and are implicated in the dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine. Chemical similarities between OP pesticides and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), a class of compounds growing in use and environmental relevance, have produced concern regarding whether developmental exposures to OPFRs and OP pesticides may share behavioral outcomes, impacts on dopaminergic systems, or both. Methods: Using the zebrafish animal model, we exposed developing fish to two OPFRs, TDCIPP and TPHP, as well as the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos, during the first 5 days following fertilization. From there, the exposed fish were assayed for behavioral abnormalities and effects on monoamine neurochemistry as both larvae and adults. An experiment conducted in parallel examined how antagonism of the dopamine system during an identical window of development could alter later life behavior in the same assays. Finally, we investigated the interaction between developmental exposure to an OPFR and acute dopamine antagonism in larval behavior. Results: Developmental exposure to all three OP compounds altered zebrafish behavior, with effects persisting into adulthood. Additionally, exposure to an OPFR decreased the behavioral response to acute D2 receptor antagonism in larvae. However, the pattern of behavioral effects diverged substantially from those seen following developmental dopamine antagonism, and the investigations into dopamine neurochemistry were too variable to be conclusive. Thus, although the results support the hypothesis that OPFRs, as with OP pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, may present a risk to normal behavioral development, we were unable to directly link these effects to any dopaminergic dysfunction.</p>

N1  - <p>Parkinson’s disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are motor conditions characterized by dysfunction of dopaminergic signaling in the brain. The origins of these dopamine-related movement conditions are largely unknown. Epidemiological studies have suggested that environmental causes may exist, as evidenced by the association between the onset of these disorders and risk factors like exposures to pesticides and lead, both of which can target the dopaminergic nervous system. In light of these suspected associations, a need exists for the development of a screen for dopaminergic toxicity so that potential hazardous chemicals can be identified. This work describes a model of dopaminergic dysfunction using larval zebrafish. Specifically, behavioral analyses following acute exposure to dopaminergic drugs and toxicants are detailed, in addition to the effects of developmental lesioning on behavior and dopaminergic pathway structure. In general, larval zebrafish appear to be good predictors of dopaminergic dysfunction, and may serve as an efficient model system in identifying environmental agents that may contribute to the onset of dopamine-related movement disorders.</p>

N1  - <p>Environmental pollution through industrial chemicals or pesticides has emerged as a major health issue for humans and the environment. While several of these chemicals were shown to adversely affect nervous system development, the estimated number of potential neurotoxicants is likely to be much higher. Such developmental perturbations cost society billions of dollars and result in IQ loss in children and several other neurological disorders. As there is currently no cure for such disorders, prevention is essential. Yet, the mechanisms leading to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) are poorly understood, making prevention difficult. Consequently, methods and strategies are required that allow for a fast and reliable screening of potentially neurotoxic or -active substances. With regards to this the zebrafish ($Danio$ $rerio$) embryo has emerged as a model organism. The embryos provide multiple advantageous features, promoting its use in DNT investigations as a non-mammal in vivo test system.In the work at hand, it was hypothesised that zebrafish embryos can be used to generate comprehensive insights into the mechanisms underlying DNT. To reveal these mechanisms, this thesis defined several objectives. First, to assess the applicability of zebrafish embryo behaviour for DNT screens. Therefore, six different insecticides and four endocrine disruptors (EDs) were used. Subsequently, observed behavioural deficits were to be investigated on multiple molecular levels to clarify underlying mechanisms, thus presenting the second goal. Thirdly the applicability of the embryos to lipidome investigations and their relevance for DNT-testing was to be assessed.To accomplish the first goal, it was aimed to increase the information output of one of the most commonly used behaviour assays, the light/ dark transition (LDT) test. Data evaluation was done by integrating multiple parameters at once, thereby retrieving additional information that was indicative for underlying (neuro-) toxic mechanisms. Furthermore, the experimental ...</p>

N1  - <p>Given the continually increasing global polymer production, environmental pollution from plastic debris has been widely perceived as an ecological threat with potentially adverse (eco-)toxicological impacts on various species and ecosystems. Especially small fragments of plastic debris measuring 1 &lt;= 1000 µm in size - so-called microplastics (MPs) - can pose a risk to biota by physical or chemical hazards due to ingestion, sorption and transfer of anthropogenic environmental pollutants (e.g., pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals). In recent years, there has been extensive research on the impact of streams and rivers as main entry routes for MPs into the marine environment. However, the evidence of adverse effects caused by the intake of MPs and the transfer of contaminants sorbed to MPs into freshwater ecosystems is still not conclusively documented. Therefore, this thesis addressed the impact of microplastic particles in limnic ecosystems by investigating the biological fate and effects of MPs and associated anthropogenic pollutants on different life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). To this end, effects of two common environmental pollutants (benzo(k)fluoranthene, chlorpyrifos) and two synthetic polymers (polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate) were investigated with regard to alterations of complementary biomarkers during acute and chronic exposure, as well as the trophic transfer of MPs and MP-sorbed contaminants from invertebrate organisms to zebrafish and acute toxic effects of MPs pre-exposed in a natural aquatic ecosystem. Overall, the sorption of both anthropogenic pollutants to MPs could be confirmed under various exposure scenarios. In contrast to recent study results, no adverse effects were observed when zebrafish were exposed to clean, pristine polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate. The ingestion of MPs was documented in the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish and did not induce any physiological impairment. The uptake of both pollutants was verified for all investigated species by GC-MS and fluorescence measurements. In the acute exposure scenario using the fish embryo toxicity test (FET), zebrafish embryos displayed sublethal effects and morphological deformities related to the underlying mode of action of benzo(k)fluoranthene and chlorpyrifos. Exposure to MP-associated contaminants significantly reduced malformations and attenuated biomarker responses of acetylcholine esterase activity and CYP450 induction and hence indicated a reduced bioavailability of both pollutants for zebrafish embryos. Chronic exposure of adult zebrafish to both types of MPs and pollutants was designed to assess the potential impact of long-term exposure and possible bioaccumulation of these contaminants of emerging concern. However, exposure to MP-sorbed pollutants failed to alter biomarker responses over the prolonged experimental period. In addition, a novel approach was applied to monitor the uptake of benzo(k)fluoranthene in the intestinal epithelium using confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, no significant bioaccumulation or biotransformation of benzo(k)fluoranthene and chlorpyrifos in brain and liver tissue could be demonstrated using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection and with a high-resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-FLD/HRMS). In order to address the possible vector effects of MPs, the transfer of benzo(k)fluoranthene and polymethyl methacrylate particles in a simplified limnic food web were investigated, consisting of zooplankton (Daphnia magna), sediment-dwelling invertebrates (Chironomus riparius larvae) and zebrafish as highlevel predator. However, the trophic transfer of benzo(k)fluoranthene via MPs could not be confirmed by a combination of highly sensitive fluorescence tracking using CLSM, hepatic CYP450 induction, and advanced chemical-analytical methods. To account for the demand for environmentally relevant exposure scenarios and to improve risk assessment of MPs, a mixture of the most commonly used synthetic polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride) was exposed in a well-monitored surface water body. To evaluate the potential transfer of hazardous pollutants under natural conditions, the toxicity of the MP mixture was assessed in terms of acute toxic effects (FET), potential neurotoxic effects (AChE activity, larval visual motor response test) and effects of dioxin-like substances (EROD assay) using zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, the exposed MP mixture did not elicit significantly different effects than the natural particles from sediment and suspended matter samples. Eventually, it could only be confirmed that MPs could act as carriers for environmental contaminants following ingestion by various organisms. However, increased deleterious effects of MP-sorbed contaminants on various sensitive life stages of zebrafish could not be corroborated by acute or prolonged exposure, trophic transfer, or natural exposure. The findings suggest that the sorption of pollutants to MPs is more likely to reduce the bioavailability as a result of slow desorption within the organism. Although, MPs offer an alternative exposure route for aquatic organisms via ingestion. Even chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations did not induce bioaccumulation of both highly lipophilic substances in zebrafish tissues. Lastly, the sorption behavior of MPs under realistic environmental exposure conditions was more likely to approximate the behavior of natural particles. Consequently, MPs might pose only a limited risk to limnic communities, especially with regard to the comparatively small fraction of plastic particles in freshwater ecosystems compared to the multitude of naturally occurring (a)biotic particles.</p>

N1  - <p>Endocrine disruption occurs when specific chemicals interact with internal endocrine signalling pathways in organisms and appears to be particularly widespread in freshwater fish throughout the world. Effects ranged from subtle changes in the physiology and sexual behaviour of fish to permanently altered sexual differentiation and growth, and reproductive impairment. Most attention has been directed towards identifying the main estrogenic chemicals, because many of the effects reported in wildlife appear to be a consequence of ‘feminization’ of males. Environmental estrogens can be anthropogenic, such as certain pharmaceuticals, pesticides and industrial chemicals or natural, such as phyto- and mycoestrogens. Resorcyclic acid lactones (RALs) are the only known class of estrogenic mycotoxins and show estrogenic activity in the range of natural steroid estrogens. RALs occur as secondary metabolites of Fusarium spec. fungi growing on a variety of cereals. Zearalenone (ZON) belongs to the chemical group of RALs and is one of the worldwide most common mycotoxins. The occurrence of mycotoxins has been studied extensively in food, feed products, and domestic animals. Agricultural products around the world exhibited ZON contaminations of up to 69 % of the tested samples. However, only little is known about the ecotoxicological effects of ZON at concentrations found in the environment. In this research project, the ecotoxicological potential of ZON was evaluated. Effects on fish caused by an exposure to ZON were assessed using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism. An embryo toxicity test was performed to investigate toxic effects of ZON on fish development. This study was complemented with a 30 day zebrafish early life-stage experiment to assess the influence of ZON on juvenile growth. In a second step the estrogenic potency of ZON and its effects on adult fish were examined. A recombinant yeast estrogen screen (rYES) was used as an in vitro assay to determine effects on the activation of estrogen receptor-regulated genes. Zebrafish were exposed to ZON in a 42 day reproduction experiment enabling assessment of reproductive as well as physiological and morphological parameters. In a third step, the estrogenic potency of ZON was studied in a life-cycle experiment. This study was designed to investigate possible effects of continuous long-term exposure including a subsequent depuration period as well as possible transgenerational effects of F0 exposure on F1 generation. The offspring of the F0 generation that was exposed to ZON for 21 days was raised in a 140 day exposure experiment from embryo to adult. In a subsequent 42 day reproduction experiment, spawning groups of the F1 generation were either exposed to ZON (after growing up in clean water) or clean water (after growing up under ZON exposure) and effects on developmental, reproductive as well as physiological parameters were assessed. Exposure to ZON had no effects on embryonic development up to 2000 ng/L, but a positive correlation between the body length and ZON concentration of up to 100 ng/L suggests a growth promoting effect for zebrafish exposed during 30 days. Although ZON revealed a moderate estrogenic potency in vitro (rYES), it exhibited a comparably strong effect on induction of VTG (1000 ng/L) and reproduction (100 ng/L) in vivo during 21 days exposure. It was further demonstrated that ZON influenced growth (1000 ng/L), sexual differentiation (320 ng/L), reproduction (1000 ng/L), and VTG levels (1000 ng/L) in zebrafish exposed from fertilization to day 140. Furthermore, ZON revealed a possible transgenerational effect on growth caused by short-term exposure of F0 and F1 generation each for 21 days to 1000 ng/L. In the framework of this project, relevant data of the ecotoxicological relevance of ZON were collected. The estrogenic potential of ZON was confirmed in vitro and in vivo and detrimental effects on zebrafish reproduction were demonstrated. This indicates that ZON may have an effect on fish populations in the aquatic environment. Effects were observed at concentrations near the maximum measured values in surface waters (approximately double) and below the maximum values measured in effluents (approximately half). Even though to date there is not much data published presenting ZON concentrations in the aquatic environment and effects on different (native) fish species, this project demonstrated that ZON has the potential to pose a threat to fish in the aquatic environment. In a second research project, the embryo toxicity and genotoxicity of biofilm and sediment from the catchment area of a STP was investigated. An embryo toxicity test with zebrafish and the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) with primary cells isolated from the embryos were applied to investigate native biofilm for the first time. Biofilms were sampled from different sections of the sewage system and sediments were taken from the rive Wyna directly at, upstream and downstream of the STP discharge Mittleres Wynental (Switzerland). The aim of this study was to verify the applicability of the aforementioned test system to investigate native biofilm and to evaluate the toxicity of the different sampling sites. Clear differences in the embryo toxicity and genotoxicity of the biofilm from different sewage system sections as well as from the sediment sampling sites were found. Significant genotoxicity was determined in all biofilm and sediment samples. Temporal variability in toxicity were observed in some of the biofilm and sediment samples. Based on the results of this study it can be suggested that biofilm implemented in ecotoxicological bioassays such as the embryo toxicity test and comet assay with zebrafish can be a useful tool to assess (waste) water quality.</p>

N1  - <p>Fish are highly dependent on olfaction since a variety of indispensable behaviors are mediated via this sensory modality. Situated in cavities at the dorsal part of the cranium, the fish olfactory epithelium (OE), which contains the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) responsible for odorant detection, is in almost direct contact to the ambient water and thus readily accessible for both odorants and dissolved contaminants. In the last decades, an increasing number of studies demonstrated that numerous pollutants, among them metals and pesticides, are able to impair olfaction in environmentally relevant concentrations, thereby disrupting pivotal behaviors. However, the toxic mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction largely remain unknown and despite the paramount significance of olfaction for fish, olfactory endpoints have not yet been incorporated into the environmental risk assessment of chemicals. The objective of the present Ph.D. thesis was to investigate the impact of three commonly used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, linuron, and permethrin) and cadmium (Cd) on the olfactory system of zebrafish (Danio rerio). In doing so, this thesis further aimed at contributing to the establishment of zebrafish as a model for evaluating olfactory toxicity. In order to enhance the understanding of the toxic mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunctions, the effect of contaminants on the olfactory system was analyzed at different levels of biological organization. Employing quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, it was shown that Cd, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin differentially alter the expression of OSN marker genes in the OE. Furthermore, Cd and chlorpyrifos induced genes associated with stress in the OE, but only Cd increased the expression of such genes in the olfactory bulb (OB). The assessment of second messengers with central roles in olfactory signal transduction showed that linuron decreased the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the OE. The influence of the pollutants on the olfactory mediated ...</p>

N1  - <p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting seven to ten million people worldwide. Familial forms of PD account for 5-10% of all PD cases suggesting that other factors such as the environment have a role in the development of sporadic cases of PD. Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for PD. Ziram, a dithiocarbamate fungicide commonly used in California, increases the risk of PD for individuals living and working in areas where the pesticide is sprayed. Ziram has previously been found in vitro to cause selective dopaminergic cell toxicity, inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) levels in primary neuronal cultures. In this dissertation we utilize zebrafish embryos (ZF, Danio rerio) to study ziram in an in vivo system and to determine if ziram’s toxicity is mediated via synuclein.We found that ziram is toxic to ZF at nanomolar concentrations and caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior in ZF. Since ziram increases α-syn concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF γ-synuclein 1 (γ1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms and ZF γ1 appears to be a functional homologue of α-syn. We found that recombinant ZF γ1 formed fibrils in vitro and overexpression of ZF γ1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity similarly to α-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF γ1 with morpholinos or disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 protected against ziram’s DA toxicity.Over the course of this dissertation we have demonstrated that ziram is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo and that its toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings provide potentially important mechanistic implications on how ziram and possibly other environmental toxins can contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD.</p>

N1  - <p>The Pantanal (Brazil) is one of the largest wetlands in the world and is home to a considerable diversity of aquatic organisms. The region is based on a hydrological cycle where each year the rivers flood extensive areas and periods of drought return the water to the river beds, with important variations in the physicochemical properties of the water of rivers and lagoons. Associated with this it has been observed an increasing growth of agricultural and livestock activities that heavily depend on chemical products (pesticides) to ensure production in the region. The effects of these compounds on the environment, especially in water bodies, are not very well known. Thus, it is important to assess the effects of these compounds on aquatic fauna taking into consideration environmental variation (which can still be exacerbated in a climate change scenario). Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of Barrage®, a cypermethrin-based pesticide widely used in the region in shrimp species (one endemic to the Pantanal) and zebrafish model. In a first phase, effects of pH and nitrite concentrations variation in the toxicity of Barrage® were studied using larvae of Macrobrachium pantanalense, Macrobrachium amazonicum and Danio rerio. In a second phase, histological effects were studied in adults of M. pantanalense. Finally, larvae of Palaemons varians were tested as model for behavioral analysis (locomotion) and behavioral toxicity of Barrage® tested in this species and in D. rerio larvae. The results of this thesis confirm that pH and nitrite modify the toxicity of Barrage® to the tested species, mainly at sublethal level (larval growth and development). Results suggest that lethality may not be sufficient to correctly predict the combined effects of stressors and that inclusion of endemic species is crucial to the correct risk evaluation on sensitive biomas such as Pantanal. P. varians larvae revealed to be a good model for locomotor activity evaluation and were sensitive to the Barrage® effects ...</p>

N1  - <p>The field of toxicology is under growing pressure to meet the demand of hazard assessment for the increasingly vast number of environmental toxicants. Due to low throughput and high cost, the traditional toxicity testing strategy, using rodent and higher mammalian animal-based models, is unable to adequately meet these competing demands. Hence, there is increasing recognition of the value of transforming toxicity testing to reduce the usage of mammal models and to more efficiently and reliably predict human relevant toxicity. To this end, a battery approach, integrating diverse in vitro and alternative animal models, was initiated to complement and accelerate hazard assessment. These alternative models are amenable to inexpensive, rapid and robust screening. In this dissertation, I introduce the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a novel alternative animal model to study developmental neurotoxicity. I developed and expanded a fully automated planarian high-throughput (HTS) screening platform to accomplish rapid screening of multiple morphological and behavioral endpoints. This HTS platform was evaluated for robustness, strengths and weaknesses, using an 87-compound library with known and suspected compounds and a 15-compound flame retardant library. As a unique advantage, the similar size of adult and regenerating planarians allows for direct comparison of two worm types to discern development-specific toxicity from overt systemic toxicity. We show that planarian is a useful model to potentially link toxicity pathways to whole-animal adverse functional outcomes by providing a large repertoire of behavioral endpoints. Comparative analysis of the planarian model with other alternative models, including zebrafish, nematode and in vitro cell-based models, provides insight into how different models complement each other in the battery approach. Finally, I discuss our comparative screen of organophosphrous pesticides (OPs) using the expanded platform, to investigate the possible mechanisms of developmental toxicity in OPs. Altogether, by establishing a new alternative animal model this work adds value to the battery approach to accelerate toxicity screening and prioritize toxicants, and provide further insight into the potential mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity.</p>

N1  - <p>Doutoramento em Biologia ; In the environment humans and biota are generally exposed to chemical mixtures rather than individual chemicals. Therefore, when assessing the environmental risk of chemicals, it is important to consider chemical mixtures and their possible interactions. The main objective of this work focused on the environmental risk assessment of pesticides found in the water of the Alqueva reservoir and their binary combinations. In this aquatic ecosystem several pesticides were above of the environmental quality standards. But in addition, there were several sampling points of the reservoir where ecotoxicity was observed despite the presence of these contaminants at low concentrations. Here, a component-based approach was used to assess the effects of the pesticide mixtures. The effects of the binary combinations of four herbicides, atrazine (ATR), terbuthylazine (TER), simazine (SIM) and metolachlor (MET), on the growth rate of the microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the effects of the binary combinations of the s-triazine herbicides ATR and TER and the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) on the swimming behaviour and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of the zebrafish Danio rerio were assessed using the two reference models of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). Moreover, the combined effects of the herbicides (ATR, TER and MET) and the insecticide CPF were also tested on the swimming behaviour and AChE activity of the aquatic midge Chironomus riparius after the cholinesterases characterization. In this risk characterization, the calculated risk quotients for the herbicides ATR, TER, SIM and MET were higher than 1, meaning that these herbicides present a high risk for the Alqueva ecosystem. As expected, the microalgae P. subcapitata was the most sensitive species to the herbicides. However, despite these herbicides pose no or low risk to other aquatic organisms tested in this study, with EC50 values much higher than the concentrations found in this aquatic ecosystem, ...</p>

N1  - <p>Agentes neurotóxicos, tais como pesticidas, solventes orgânicos e metais, são capazes de alterar a atividade normal do Sistema Nervoso Central (SNC). O manganês (Mn) é um metal encontrado no ambiente que, quando em excesso, acumula-se no SNC, tornando-se um perigo potencial para a saúde. Além do Mn, outros agentes neurotóxicos podem causar alterações, levando a déficits em sistemas de neurotransmissão. O crescimento de pragas de lavoura tem aumentado exponencialmente o uso de agrotóxicos para manutenção de plantações. O fungicida tebuconazol é um triazol utilizado em culturas como a cevada, trigo, amendoim e frutas do pomar e relacionado com alterações comportamentais e oxidativas. O inseticida diclórvos, pertence a família dos organofosforados atuando através da inibição da acetilcolinesterase (AChE), que leva à hiperestimulação dos receptores colinérgicos. O sistema colinérgico é caracterizado pela ação da acetilcolina (ACh) nos receptores muscarínicos e nicotínicos. O nível dessa molécula é regulado pela acetilcolinesterase (AChE), que catalisa a degradação da ACh em colina e acetato. O sistema purinérgico é caracterizado pela ação do ATP e adenosina (ADO) nos purinoreceptores P2 e P1, respectivamente. Os níveis dessas moléculas são regulados pela ação das ectonucleotidases que catalisam a hidrólise do ATP a adenosina (ADO). A ADO pode ser desaminada a inosina (INO) pela ação da adenosina desaminase (ADA). A dopamina (DA), sintetizada a partir da L-DOPA, é o neurotransmissor do sistema dopaminérgico e age através dos seus receptores D1-D5, controlando o início e execução do movimento.Portanto, este estudo visa avaliar os efeitos da exposição ao manganês e agrotóxicos, tais como diclórvos e tebuconazol, sobre parâmetros comportamentais em peixe-zebra nos estágios larval e adulto, bem como os seus efeitos sobre a sinalização purinérgica, colinérgica e dopaminérgica. A exposição ao MnCl2 nos estágios iniciais de desenvolvimento (1 hpf - 5 dpf) foi capaz de reduzir a distância percorrida, o ângulo de giro absoluto e o tempo de mobilidade das larvas aos 5, 7 e 10 dpf. Além disso, causou um aumento nos níveis de TH aos 5 e 7 dpf, seguido por uma redução em 10 dpf. Também foi observado um aumento dos marcadores de morte celular. Em animais adultos, a exposição ao longo de 96 horas causou redução na distância percorrida, número de cruzamentos e ângulo de giro absoluto, e ainda uma redução na aquisição de memória através da tarefa de esquiva inibitória. Além disso, os animais adultos expostos a MnCl2 apresentaram aumento nos níveis de marcadores de morte celular, além de TH e DOPAC (ácido 3,4-di-hidroxifenilacético) no encéfalo. A exposição por 96 horas a este metal também foi capaz de inibir a atividade das NTPDases e da ecto-ADA e reduzir os transcritos de RNAm do gene ADA2.1, além de aumentar os níveis de ADP e reduzir a quantidade de AMP, ADO e INO no meio. O tebuconazol foi capaz de aumentar a distância ocular de larvas aos 5 dpf e reduzir a capacidade exploratória desses animais, e ainda diminuir a atividade locomotora de peixe-zebra adultos expostos por 96 horas. Além disso, este fungicida diminuiu a atividade da AChE tanto em larvas de 5 dpf, quanto em encéfalo de animais adultos. Além do mais, o tebuconacol aumentou a expressão relativa de mRNA da AChE em larvas, no entanto, não alterou em adultos.A exposição ao diclórvos, nas fases iniciais do desenvolvimento (1 hpf - 7 dpf), reduziu o tamanho corporal, a taxa de batimentos cardíacos e a superfície dos olhos de larvas de 7 dpf, bem como afetou a capacidade de escape de larvas aos 7 e 14 dpf. Além disso, reduziu a capacidade exploratória aos 7 e 14 dpf, padrão mantido quando os animais tornaram-se adultos jovens aos 30 dpf, e adultos aos 70 dpf. No entanto, as análises realizadas aos 120 dpf mostraram recuperação da atividade comportamental similar ao grupo controle. A análise aos 120 dpf da exposição ao diclórvos nas fases iniciais do desenvolvimento sobre as enzimas do sistema purinérgico mostrou que este inseticida é capaz de elevar a atividade da ecto-5’-nucleotidase e reduzir a atividade da ecto-ADA. Os resultados mostram que os agentes neurotóxicos, tais como Mn, diclórvos e tebuconazol têm atuação significativa sobre o comportamento do peixe-zebra em estágio larval e adulto, além de afetar diferentes sistemas de neurotransmissão. Tais alterações comportamentais podem estar associadas aos déficits observados nos mecanismos neuroquímicos e moleculares investigados. ; Neurotoxic agents, such as pesticides, organic solvents and metals, are capable to alter normal CNS activity. Manganese (Mn) is a metal found in the environment, which when in excess, accumulates in the CNS making it a potential hazard to health. In addition to Mn, other neurotoxic agents can cause changes, leading to deficits in neurotransmission systems. The growth of crop pests has exponentially increased the use of agrochemicals to maintain plantations. The fungicide tebuconazole is a triazole used in crops, such as barley, wheat, peanuts and orchard fruits and related to behavioral and oxidative changes. The insecticide dichlorvos, belongs to organophosphate family, acts through the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) inhibition, leading to hyperstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic system is characterized by the action of acetylcholine(ACh) on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The level of this molecule is regulated by acetylcholinesterase(AChE), which catalyzes degradation of ACh into choline and acetate. Purinergic system is characterized by the action of ATP and adenosine on purinoreceptor P2 and P1, respectively. The levels of these molecules are regulated by ectonucleotidases, which constitute the extracellular cascade for ATP hydrolysis to adenosine. Adenosine can be subsequently deaminated to inosine by action of adenosine deaminase (ADA). Dopamine(DA), synthesized from L-DOPA, is the neurotransmitter of the dopaminergic system and it acts through its D1-D5 receptors, controlling the start and execution of movement. This study aims to evaluate the effects of exposure to manganese and pesticides, such as dichlorvos and tebuconazole, on behavioral parameters in larval and adult zebrafish, as well as its effects on purinergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling. Exposure to MnCl2 in the early stages of development (1 hpf - 5 dpf) was able to reduce the distance traveled, absolute turn angle and mobile time of the larvae at 5, 7 and 10 dpf.In addition, it caused an increase in TH levels at 5 and 7 dpf, followed by a reduction at 10 dpf. There was also an increase in markers of cell death. In adult animals, exposure during 96 hours caused a reduction in distance traveled, number of line crossings and absolute turn angle, and an inhibition on memory acquisition through the inhibitory avoidance task. In addition, adult animals exposed to MnCl2 showed increased levels of markers of cell death, TH and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) in the brain. The 96-hour exposure to this metal was also able to inhibit the NTPDases and ecto-ADA activities and to reduce ADA2.1-mRNA transcripts, besides for increasing ADP levels and reducing the amount of AMP, ADO and INO in the incubation medium. Tebuconazole was able to increase the ocular distance of larvae at 5 dpf and reduce the exploratory behavior of these animals, and still decrease the locomotor activity of 96 hours exposed adult zebrafish. Moreover, this fungicide decreased AChE activity in both 5 dpf larvae and brains of adult animals. Exposure to dichlorvos (1 hpf - 7 dpf) reduced body length, heartbeat rate and larval surface at 7 dpf as well as affected the escape capacity of larvae at 7 and 14 dpf. Further, it reduced exploratory behavior at 7 and 14 dpf, maintaining this pattern when animals became young adults at 30 dpf, and adults at 70 dpf. However, the analysis performed at 120 dpf showed a recovery of behavioral activity equal to the control. In addition, the analysis of exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development at 120 dpf on the enzymes of the purinergic system, showed that this insecticide is able to elevate the ecto-5’-nucleotidase activity and reduce the ecto-ADA activity.The results showed that neurotoxic agents, such as Mn, dichlorvos and tebuconazole, play a role in the larval and adult behavior of zebrafish, and affect different neurotransmission systems. Such behavioral changes may be associated with the deficits observed in neurochemical and molecular mechanisms investigated.</p>

N1  - <p>A paradigm shift has recently occurred in the field of toxicology, transitioning away from traditional mammalian models in favor of time- and cost-efficient alternatives, such as in vitro systems and non-mammalian animal models, which are amenable to high-throughput screening. We have pioneered the asexual freshwater planarian, Dugesia japonica, as an alternative model for developmental neurotoxicology. Planarians have strong regenerative capabilities, wherein after decapitation, the resulting tail piece will regenerate a new head, including a brain, within 2 weeks. Moreover, planarians possess several quantifiable behaviors coordinated by distinct neuronal subpopulations, enabling testing of both adult and developing/regenerating animals with the same assays to directly compare effects on neuronal function. We have established and begun validating the planarian toxicology platform through screens testing 10-87 compounds. We demonstrate that planarians have similar sensitivity to existing alternative animal models, such as developing zebrafish. Planarians are particularly sensitive to pesticides and are good predictors of known developmentally neurotoxic pesticides, such as organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), one of the most used class of pesticides in the world. OPs are acutely toxic due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent cholinergic overstimulation. However, growing evidence suggests that chronic, low dose exposure to OPs, particularly during development, may cause toxicity independent of effects on AChE. Alternative mechanisms of OP developmental neurotoxicity have been proposed, but direct connections between molecular/cellular defects with their functional significance have been limited using traditional models. Our planarian screening platform, on the other hand, is uniquely suited to provide the necessary link between mechanism and functional effects. First, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo properties of planarian cholinesterase and its structural and functional interactions with OPs to contextualize known OP mechanisms. Second, through a comparative screen of 6 OPs and chemicals targeting suggested alternative OP targets, including the endocannabinoid system, cytoskeleton and oxidative stress, we correlate the distinct toxicological profiles of different OPs with specific toxic pathways. Together, these studies demonstrate the utility of the planarian system to the modern toxicology pipeline, through its ability to directly connect mechanisms with their functional significance.</p>

N1  - <p>Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are neuroactive compounds that can affect the development of the nervous system and behavior. Using zebrafish, we compared the effectiveness of three different OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF), diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) on survival, AChE inhibition and larval motility. We conclude that at equimolar concentrations CPF is the most effective OP of the three tested. 300nM CPF inhibited AChE when measured at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) by 80%, which correlated to a 35% decrease in larval motility when measured at 6 dpf. We isolated the cDNA of zfkcc2 , which encodes for an important cation-chloride cotransporter responsible for establishing a chloride gradient that allows for the neurotransmitter GABA to become inhibitory for a subset of neurons. By isolating the cDNA of zfkcc2 , we were able to characterize its expression pattern up to 4 dpf. Using qRT-PCR, we showed that the expression of zfkcc2 rises from 2 to 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). The expression of zfkcc2 is found at 1 dpf in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain in a distinct pattern. By 3 dpf, zfkcc2 expression is found throughout most of the developing zebrafish brain. We were then able to characterize the expression pattern of zfnkcc1, which encodes for a cation-chloride cotransporter that works opposite to zfkcc2 and establishes a chloride gradient allowing GABA to be excitatory during development. Expression of zfnkcc1 is found at 1 dpf throughout most of the developing zebrafish head including in some non-neural tissue, but appears concentrated to the otic vesicle at 3 dpf. Using double in situ hybridization, we investigated the nature of the developmental switch from zfnkcc1 to zfkcc2 by looking at regions where there was an interaction between both genes’ expression patterns in the developing zebrafish nervous system. We preliminarily examined how affecting nicotinic signaling with exposures to nicotinic agonists/antagonists can affect the expression of zfnkcc2 and zfkcc2 . While there were no apparent changes in the expression pattern from any of the exposures at 2 dpf, we found that by 3 dpf nicotine and CPF exposures resulted in an incomplete expression pattern for zfkcc2 that seemed to be delayed. However, the expression of zfnkcc1 at the otic vesicle was unaffected by exposure. Our results suggest that disrupting nicotinic signaling during development can affect the expression of an important cation-chloride cotransporter, zfkcc2 , that plays a major role in establishing the necessary chloride gradient for the proper functioning of GABA during development. Future studies should focus on investigating the nature of the developmental switch between zfnkcc1 and zfkcc2 to see if the possibility of their regulation being coupled is a target for exposures.</p>

N1  - <p>Endokrini disraptori su prirodni i sintetički spojevi koji negativno utječu na hormonalni sustav životinja oponašajući prirodne hormone u tijelu i narušavajući njihov sadržaj i koncentraciju u organizmu. U okoliš dospijevaju putem podzemnih i površinskih voda, a neki od najčešće korištenih endokrinih disraptora u ovakvim istraživanjima sastavni su dio proizvoda za ljudsku upotrebu. Nalaze se u pesticidima, fungicidima, insekticidima ili plastifikatorima. Kao modelni organizam za istraživanje učinaka endokrinih disraptora koristi se mala tropska akvarijska ribica zebrica (Danio rerio). Istraživanja pokazuju kako endokrini disraptori utječu na spolni, hormonalni, osjetilni i živčani sustav te na ponašanje jedinki zebrice. Ovakvi spojevi uzrokuju deformacije u razvitku spolnih žlijezda zebrice te promjenu spolova. Tako\djer, djeluju na tiroidnu žlijezdu što dovodi do negativnih posljedica u pravilnome rastu i razvitku ličinki zebrice. Endokrini disraptori utječu i na stanice bočne pruge zebrice te brojne neurotransmitere i enzime središnjeg živčanog sustava. Osim toga, uzrokuju pojavu anksioznosti i straha u jedinkama zebrice. Kako je genom zebrice vrlo sličan ljudskom genomu, ovakva bi istraživanja mogla poslužiti kao alat za otkrivanje učinaka endokrinih disraptora na čovjeka. ; Endocrine disruptors are natural and synthetic compounds that negatively affect hormonal system of the animals.

N1  - <p>蚯蚓多生活於土壤中，但在大雨過後的清晨，常可看到許多蚯蚓爬出地表，進而陳屍於地表。根據前人的研究發現，紫外線照射會影響蚯蚓的爬行，推測紫外線可能為造成蚯蚓陳屍地表的原因。本實驗以在台灣大雨過後常可見爬出地表的物種纖細遠盲蚓(Amynthas gracilis)作為研究對象，該物種在照射紫外線-B (UV-B)時會產生不正常的S形運動和跳動等行為反應，並且對碰觸刺激變得敏感，因此本實驗目的在探討紫外線-B (UV-B)影響蚯蚓運動模式的機制。首先，在c-Fos做為神經細胞活性指標的實驗中發現，蚯蚓經過紫外線B的照射後，蚯蚓的腹神經索中確實有神經細胞被活化，表示紫外線B確實可以影響蚯蚓神經的活性，於是進一步探討紫外線B如何調控蚯蚓的神經系統以達到影響運動的效果。蚯蚓照射紫外線B會影響蚯蚓的AChE活性，並使神經的PKCα活性上升，而這樣的活性變化皆不是酵素直接吸收紫外線所造成的，AChE是神經突觸間重要的酵素，可分解acetylcholine (ACh)，調控神經傳導物質作用的時間; PKC已知為脊椎動物神經細胞內重要的細胞訊息傳遞物質，可調控鈣離子通道，影響神經傳導物質ACh的釋放，或是調控合成ACh的酵素choline acetyltransferase的活性，達到調控神經傳導的效果。利用PKC活化劑PMA以及鈣離子通道A23187改變PKC的活性，皆可發現會促進蚯蚓照射紫外線B時的運動行為，而鈣離子通道的抑制劑則會抑制蚯蚓照射紫外線B產生的運動，AChE抑制劑chlorpyrifos的處理也會對蚯蚓的運動產生促進效果，由此可知，AChE和PKC活性的改變，確實會影響蚯蚓在紫外線照射下所出現的行為反應，因此推論紫外線會藉由改變這兩個酵素活性來影響蚯蚓的運動模式。 ; Earthworms usually live in the soil, but some earthworms could be found lying dead on the surface of the ground after a heavy rain. UV radiation was suspected to affect earthworm crawling. Since earthworms, Amynthas gracilis, are often observed lying on the soil surface after a heavy rain in Taiwan, the earthworms were used as an animal model in this experiment. Under UV-B exposure, they showed the abnormal behaviors, the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment is to determine how the UV-B radiation affects the earthworm movement behaviors. Some Fos-labelled cells in earthworm ventral nerve cord were shown after the UV-B radiation. This suggested that some neurons were activated by UV-B radiation. The UV-B radiated nerves were found to have higher protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activity, an effect not mediated by direct UV-B absorption. PKC might regulate the calcium channel(s) to increase the intracellular calcium concentration to alter acetylcholine (ACh) release and choline acetyltransferase to affect ACh synthesis in presynaptic cells. The treatment of PKC activator, PMA and calcium ionophore, A23187 both enhanced the abnormal behavior caused by UV-B radiation. And calcium channels blocker, verapamil blocked the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation. On the other hand, the UV-B radiation also affected the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in the synaptic cleft for ACh hydrolysis. Again, AChE activity was not affected by direct UV-B absorption. And AChE inhibitor, chlorpyrifos, treatment enhanced the earthworm behavior. Together, all of those results support that PKCα and AChE are involved in the regulation of earthworm movement caused by UV-B radiation. ; Introduction - 1 - Earthworms come out the soil - 1 - Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone depletion on the earth - 2 - UV damage - 2 - Neuron-muscle regulation - 4 - Materials and Methods……………………………………………………………-7- Animals - 7 - Chemicals - 7 - UV exposure - 7 - Behaviors of earthworm - 7 - Fos immunohistochemistry - 8 - Protein kinase C activity - 9 - Acetylcholinesterase assay - 11 - H2O2 treatment on isolated body wall - 11 - Statistical analysis - 12 - Results - 13 - The movement behavior of earthworms - 13 - Fos immunohistochemistry - 13 - The earthworm nerve PKCα activity after UV-B exposure - 14 - PMA enhanced the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 14 - A23187 treatment enhanced the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 15 - The influence of verapamil treatment on the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 15 - The AChE activity after UV-B exposure - 16 - Chlorpyrifos treatment enhanced the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 16 - The influence of H2O2 on earthworm AChE activity - 17 - Discussion - 18 - Reference - 22 - Figures………………………………………………………………………… …-29-</p>

N1  - <p>Complex mixtures of anthropogenic chemicals including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals, are entering the aquatic environment via surface runoff, leaching, and effluent discharge. The increasing chemical load has raised concerns in regard to the protection of aquatic ecosystem health. This dissertation focuses on two different approaches to evaluate aquatic toxicity due to chemicals. The first approach focuses on adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to understand the interactions between contaminants and molecular initiating events and the translation of molecular level insults to apical level endpoints such as behavior and growth which are relevant to an ecological risk assessor. The impacts of two chemical classes (azole and strobilurin) of fungicides on aquatic vertebrate (zebrafish, Danio rerio) were studied using the AOP approach. Several molecular, cellular, and apical endpoints were assessed in embryo-larval zebrafish exposed to azole and strobilurin fungicides. The azole fungicides were shown to induce lipid peroxidation and apoptosis whereas strobilurin fungicides decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics, induced oxidative stress, and was associated with decreased swimming behavior and growth. These kinds of studies are vital to understand the impact of individual or classes of contaminants on aquatic organisms and they also generate data to help a risk assessor make informed decisions to protect aquatic health. Although prior knowledge of exposure is beneficial, in the natural environment, aquatic organisms may be exposed to complex chemical mixtures with an unknown composition and toxicity. The recent advances in analytical instrumentation (e.g. high-resolution mass spectrometry) could help us to understand the composition of complex chemical mixtures using a non-targeted analysis workflow. This dissertation explored a new approach to understand and predict impacts of complex mixtures on aquatic health. This approach integrates information from the non-targeted analysis into a quantitative structural activity relationship model to predict molecular level toxicity signatures, called NTA-QSAR workflow. The applicability of NTA-QSAR workflow was validated by toxicity testing of an effluent dominated stream (Lubbock Canyon Lake System) using early life stages of zebrafish. The NTA-QSAR workflow predicted that water samples from the Lubbock Canyon Lake System may act on receptors from the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway, the serotonin receptor signaling pathway, and the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in aquatic vertebrates. The impact on the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway and the serotonin receptor signaling pathway were confirmed by exposing early life stages of zebrafish to ambient water samples. This research will aid in chemical fingerprint guided effect analysis of complex chemical mixtures which could ultimately help risk assessors in the protection of environmental and human health.</p>

N1  - <p>Thiamethoxam (TM) is a commonly used neonicotinoid pesticide that acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. TM has been detected in surface waters at levels above aquatic life benchmarks and has raised concerns about its potential toxicity to fish. To address these concerns, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TM were determined in two fish species. Acute and chronic exposures to 0.02-163 μg TM/L were conducted in embryonic- and larval-stage fathead minnows and in embryonic-stage zebrafish. Endpoints to assess health and neurotoxicity were monitored throughout the duration of the exposure, including survival, hatching, foraging efficiency, embryonic motor activity, and predator escape behavior. TM-exposed fathead minnows experienced reductions in survival, changes to embryonic motor activity, and altered predator escape behavior while TM-exposed zebrafish embryos experienced reduced hatching rates and changes to the predator escape behavior. Lastly, molecular modeling was used to gain preliminary insight on the interactions of TM with the nAChR between organisms. While TM does not target fish, they still experience effects as a result of TM exposure. Taken together, this research indicates that further investigation of the effects of TM on fish is necessary to determine the impacts of this prevalent pesticide on the health of aquatic ecosystems.</p>

N1  - <p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, quickly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of motor neurons. ALS affects approximately 1 in 400 people worldwide, and most ALS cases are sporadic (sALS) with no known causative factors. Previous work has indicated that the organochlorine pesticide cis-chlordane is found more often in the blood of sALS patients than controls (Su et al., 2016), however little is known about how environmental risk factors induce motor neuron death. Here we show that cis-chlordane is especially toxic to motor neurons in vitro and induces motor neuron degeneration and NMJ deficits in vivo using zebrafish. We find that stem-cell derived motor neurons are more sensitive to cis-chlordane than other cell types and show that cis-chlordane treatment toxicity is independent of its known antagonism at the GABAA receptor. Our transcriptomic analysis of motor neurons indicates that cis-chlordane treatment disrupts similar mechanisms to those previously observed in ALS, inducing ER and mitochondrial stress and perturbing ion homeostasis. Investigation of these perturbations in vitro indicates that autophagic activity and ROS levels increase with cis-chlordane treatment. Our results lay the groundwork for studying how environmental pollutants contribute to sporadic ALS etiology. ; In Copyright – Non-Commercial Use Permitted (InC-NC)</p>

N1  - <p>Following the phase out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), manufacturers turned to several alternative flame retardants (FRs) to meet flammability standards. Organophosphate FRs (OPFRs), and in particular tris (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), have been increasingly detected in textiles and foam padding used in a variety of consumer products including camping equipment, upholstered furniture, and baby products. Like PBDEs, OPFRs are additive, meaning that they are not chemically bound to the treated material and can more readily leach out into the surrounding environment. Indeed, OPFRs have been detected in numerous environmental and biological matrices, often at concentrations similar to or exceeding that of PBDEs. Although OPFRs have been in use for several decades, relatively little is known regarding their potential for adverse human and environmental health consequences. However, based on their structural similarity to OP pesticides, they may have analogous mechanisms of toxicity. OP pesticide toxicity is classically associated with cholinesterase inhibition, resulting in cholinergic intoxication syndrome. OPFRs have been shown to be ineffective cholinesterase inhibitors, however chlorpyrifos (CPF) and other OP pesticides have been shown to elicit adverse effects on developing organisms through other mechanisms. The main objective of this research project was to evaluate the toxicity of four structurally similar OPFRs (TDCPP; tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, (TDBPP); tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) in comparison to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a well-studied OP pesticide. A combination of in vitro and in vivo models was used to elucidate potential mechanisms as well as functional consequences of exposure in developing organisms. In the first research aim, a series of in vitro experiments with neurotypic PC12 cells was used to evaluate the effects of four structurally similar OPFRs (TDCPP, TDBPP, TCEP, or TCPP) and CPF on neurodevelopment. The effects of TDCPP were also compared to that of BDE-47, a major component of the commercial PentaBDE mixture. In general, TDCPP elicited similar or greater effects when compared to an equimolar concentration of CPF. All OPFRs tested produced similar decrements in cell number and altered phenotypic differentiation, while BDE-47 had no effect on cell number, cell growth, or neurite growth. For the second research aim, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to evaluate the effects of the same suite of chemicals on early development. TDCPP, TDBPP, and CPF elicited overt toxicity (e.g., malformations or death) within the concentration range tested (0.033-100 µM). TDBPP was the most potent with 100% mortality by 6 days post fertilization (dpf) at &gt;=3.3 µM. CPF and TDCPP showed equivalent toxicity with malformations observed in at 10 µM and significant mortality (&gt;=75%) at &gt;=33 µM. There was no overt toxicity among TCEP- and TCPP-exposed fish. All test chemicals affected larval swimming behavior on 6 dpf at concentrations below the overt toxicity threshold. Parent chemical was detected in all in embryonic (1 dpf) and larval (5 dpf) tissues. TDCPP and TDBPP showed rapid and extensive metabolism. Finally, for the third aim, juvenile (45-55 dpf) zebrafish were exposed to CPF (1 µg/g food) or TDCPP (Low TDCPP = 1 µg/g food; High TDCPP = 40 µg/g food) via diet for 28 days followed by a 7 day depuration period where all treatments received clean food. A dietary exposure was chosen to more closely recapitulate exposure in humans. Samples were collected at seven time points throughout the experiment: days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 30, 35. Whole tissues were collected for tissue accumulation and histopathology endpoints. Viscera and brain were dissected and flash frozen separately for DNA damage analyses. Tissue measurements of CPF, TDCPP, and the metabolite bis (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (BDCPP) were often below the method detection limit, however when present there was a trend towards increased accumulation with treatment and time. On Day 7 Low TDCPP caused a dramatic but transient increase in DNA damage in both viscera and brain that returned to control levels by Day 14. Similar results have been seen previously with other genotoxicants and may be due to CPF and High TDCPP inducing an adaptive response prior to the 7 day sampling point. All treatments shifted the neurohypophysis to adenohypophysis ratio (NH/AH; Day 7 only) and significantly increased thyroid follicle activation (Day 14). Finally High TDCPP affected gonad maturation, causing a significant increase in ovary follicle development (Day 14) and a transient but marked decrease in testes maturity (Day 7). Taken together these data suggest that dietary exposure to TDCPP and CPF elicits DNA damage in brain and viscera and alters endocrine function in juvenile zebrafish. Importantly, analyses were restricted to the first three time points (Days 0, 7, and 14) due to the emergence a disease among the experimental colony. Although these samples were collected prior to the disease becoming apparent, it remains a potential confounder of the current results.</p>

Als zusätzlicher interagierender Faktor wurde der Einfluss von Sauerstoffmangel auf die Toxizität von Substanzen miteinbezogen. Zur Untersuchung von komplexen Interaktionen wurde das Räuber-Beute-Verhalten zwischen Zebrabärblingen und Chironomiden-Larven (Chironomus riparius) analysiert. Einen weiteren Teil dieser Arbeit bilden Untersuchungen mit komplexen Kohlenwasserstoff-Mischungen in Form der water accomodated fraction von Rohöl und deren Auswirkungen auf das Verhalten von marinen Amphipoden (Corophium volutator), ebenso wie Halbfreilandversuche mit Süsswasseramphipoden (Gammarus pulex). Meine Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass Effekte verschiedener Substanzen auf Amphipoden und Fische auf verschiedenen biologischen Organisationsebenen und in umweltrelevanten Konzentrationen auftreten. Es konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass abiotische Parameter die Wirkung von Schadstoffen modifizieren. Bei der Untersuchung von Schadstoffmischungen mit gleichen oder unterschiedlichen Wirkmechanismen war in der Mehrheit der Fälle eine additive Wirkung der kombinierten Stressoren zu beobachten, die in der Regel auch für alle untersuchten Parameter (Enzymaktivität, Bewegungsaktivität, Entwicklungsstörungen, Mortalität) konsistent vorhanden war. Auswirkungen des neurotischen Insektizids Chlorpyrifos auf Interaktionen zwischen Fischen und Chironomiden konnten in umweltrelevanten Konzentrationsbereichen detektiert werden. Die Wirkung der water accommodated fraction von Rohöl, die ein großes Problem für aquatische Organismen in Küstenlebensgemeinschaften darstellt, konnte durch Änderungen im Verhalten des marinen Amphipoden Corophium volutator angezeigt werden. Für die kontinuierliche Überwachung der Gewässerqualität an Monitoringstationen hat sich der einheimische Bachflohkrebs Gammarus pulex als geeigneter und relevanter Testorganismus erwiesen, da er auf komplexe Schadstoffmischungen im Oberflächenwasser sensitiv reagiert. Insgesamt haben sich Verhaltensparameter in der vorliegenden Arbeit als integrative, relevante und sensitive Parameter bei den verschiedenen Fragestellungen bewährt, die auch zur Analyse von interspezifischen Interaktionen dienen können. Zur Beurteilung der Auswirkungen von Schadstoffen auf Organismen in der Umwelt sollten abiotische Parameter und Mischungen von Chemikalien miteinbezogen werden. Des Weiteren sind biochemische Messungen, ebenso wie Verhaltenstests, wichtig, um die Toxizität von Schadstoffen adäquat beurteilen zu können. Für ein integriertes Verständnis der Auswirkungen von Chemikalien auf aquatische Organismen sollte daher eine Batterie verschiedener Methoden, ebenso wie realistischere Expositionsszenarien berücksichtigt werden. ; In this work, the effects of various single substances (pesticides and metals) as well as binary mixtures of them on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae were assessed on biochemical, developmental, and organism levels. The influence of oxygen depletion on the toxicity of substances was included as an additional interacting factor. To analyse complex interactions, the predator-prey behaviour between zebrafish and chironomid larvae (Chironomus riparius) was investigated. Another aspect of this work were studies on complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as the water accommodated fraction of crude oil, and their effects on the behaviour of marine amphipods (Corophium volutator), as well as semi-field experiments with freshwater amphipods (Gammarus pulex). My investigations showed that effects of various substances in environmentally relevant concentration ranges are exerted on different levels of biological organisation, both in amphipods and fish. It could be shown that abiotic parameters modify the effects of pollutants. When investigating mixtures of substances with similar or different modes of action, additivity occurred in the majority of cases which usually were consistent for all investigated parameters (enzyme activity, locomotor activity, developmental impairment, mortality). Effects of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos on the interactions between fish and chironomids could be detected in environmentally relevant concentration ranges. The effects of the water accommodated fraction of crude oil which represents a great risk for aquatic organisms in costal habitats were displayed by alterations in the behaviour of the marine amphipod Corophium volutator. For a continuous monitoring of water quality in monitoring stations, the resident amphipod Gammarus pulex proved to be a suitable and relevant test organism, as it responds sensitive to complex mixtures of pollutants in surface waters. In summary, behavioural parameters proved to be integrative, relevant and sensitive parameters for the different research topics/questions in the present work, and can also be recommended to be used to analyse interspecific interactions. To judge on the effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms in the environment, abiotic parameters as well as mixtures of pollutants should be included. Additionally, biochemical measurements as well as behavioural tests are important, to adequately assess the toxicity of pollutants. Therefore, for an integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms, a battery of different methods as well as more realistic exposure scenarios should be taken into account.</p>

TI  - Effects of β-endosulfan on the growth and reproduction of zebrafish (Danio rerio).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Because of persistent organic pollution in aquatic environments, the widely used organochlorine pesticide endosulfan, which is a potential endocrine disruptor, is expected to pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms. In the present study, we explored the potential endocrine-disrupting risk of β-endosulfan by investigating its effect on the growth, reproduction, plasma vitellogenin, and organ histology of adult zebrafish. We found that, although β-endosulfan did not significantly affect the growth of zebrafish, it greatly decreased the hatching rate, even at a concentration as low as 10 ng/L. Interestingly, the decrease of the hatching rate was highly correlated with pathological alterations of the testes. Additionally, the values of the gonadosomatic index were significantly reduced in female zebrafish treated with 200 ng/L β-endosulfan, which was also closely associated with ovarian histological changes. More importantly, a significant increase in the level of vitellogenin was observed in all male fish treated with β-endosulfan. Based on these findings, we conclude that β-endosulfan severely affects the reproductive function of zebrafish and the synthesis of vitellogenin in the liver, and thus, β-endosulfan has a serious endocrine disruption function in zebrafish.
