	abstract = {Pesticides are unique environmental contaminants that are specifically introduced into the environment to control pests, often by killing them. Although pesticide  application serves many important purposes, including protection against crop  loss and against vector-borne diseases, there are significant concerns over the  potential toxic effects of pesticides to non-target organisms, including humans.  In many cases, the molecular target of a pesticide is shared by non-target  species, leading to the potential for untoward effects. Here, we review the  history of pesticide usage and the neurotoxicity of selected classes of  pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, to humans and  experimental animals. Specific emphasis is given to linkages between exposure to  pesticides and risk of neurological disease and dysfunction in humans coupled  with mechanistic findings in humans and animal models. Finally, we discuss  emerging techniques and strategies to improve translation from animal models to  humans.},

Residues of agrichemicals used in plant  production were detected in different environments and in different countries.  Among these agrochemicals, we studied a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH), a  fipronil-based insecticide (FBI), and their mixtures (GBH + FBI). Zebrafish  exposed to 3 and 5 mg/L of GBH spend more time in the top zone and less time in  the bottom zone. Fish exposed to 0.009 and 0.018 mg/L of FBI spent less time in  the bottom zone, whereas zebrafish exposed to the three GBH + FBI mixtures spend  more time in the top zone compared with unexposed control fish. This clear  anxiolytic pattern, in an environmental context, can directly impair the ability  of fish to avoid or evade predators. We concluded that both glyphosate-based  herbicide and fipronil-based insecticide and their mixtures alter zebrafish  behavior, which may result in significant repercussions on the maintenance of the  species as well as on the food chain and the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Ziram is a broad spectrum pesticide that belongs to the class of dimethyl-dithiocarbamate (DTC) fungicides. The objectives of this study were to  assess the effects of ziram in developing zebrafish. Ziram was highly toxic to  zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC(50) value of 1082.54 nM (∼0.33 mg/L). Zebrafish  embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to solvent control (0.1\%  DMSO), or one dose of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM ziram for 96 h. Ziram induced  lethality in a dose-dependent manner, decreased hatching rate and heartbeat, and  caused wavy deformities at 72 and 96 hpf at 100 and 1000 nM. Basal oxygen  consumption rates of zebrafish at 24 hpf were decreased with 1000 nM, suggesting  that ziram affects oxidative phosphorylation. We also measured the expression of  transcripts associated with the oxidative stress response (sod1 and sod2) and  dopamine receptor signaling at ∼96 h of exposure. There was no difference in the  expression of genes related to oxidative stress, nor those related to the  dopamine system. Locomotor activity was also assessed in larval zebrafish (7  dpf), and ziram increased total activity, the velocity in light zone, and total  distance moved at 10 nM, while it decreased the mean time spent in the dark zone  at 1 and 10 nM. Behavioral responses were dependent upon the time point and  clutch examined. These data demonstrate that ziram negatively impacts embryonic  development (i.e. mortality, hatching, heartbeat and notochord development) of  zebrafish, decreases basal respiration of embryos, and alters behavioral  responses in larvae.},

	abstract = {Dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl-dimethylphosphate), an organophosphorus pesticide used for indoor insect and livestock parasite control, is among the most common  commercially available pesticides. However, there are significant concerns over  its toxicity, especially due to its relative stability in water, soil, and air.  Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the  effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to  dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days  postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the  development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and  social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization).  Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat  rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes  (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in  escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish.  The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance  traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between  control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult  animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained  reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values  similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not  altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the  exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an  increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be  associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.},

Then, the changes of their shape, heart rate,  development and function of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative stress,  apoptosis, the expression of apoptosis-related genes and immune-related genes,  the locomotor behavior were observed and detected in acute toxicity of  famoxadone-cymoxanil. Our studies showed that, after exposure to  famoxadone-cymoxanil, zebrafish embryos had decreased heart rate, shortened body  length, swollen yolk sac. Secondly, the number of innate and adaptive immune  cells was significantly reduced; and neutrophil migration and retention at the  injury area were inhibited, indicating the developmental toxicity and  immunotoxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil on the zebrafish. We also found that the  oxidative stress related indicators of embryos were changed significantly, and  apoptosis were substantially increased. Further investigation of changes of some  key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MYD88 and NF-κB p65 revealed that the  mRNA expression of these genes was up-regulated. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression  of some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL6 and IL-1β was also  up-regulated. In addition, the activity, the total distance, time and average  speed were decreased along with the increase of exposure concentration. The  absolute turn angle, sinuosity and the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) were also increased. These results suggested that famoxadone-cymoxanil can  induce developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity and neurobehavioral toxicity in  zebrafish larvae.},

	abstract = {Iprodione is a highly effective broad-spectrum fungicide commonly used for early disease control in fruit trees and vegetables. Pesticides often flow into  watercourses due to rainfall, causing toxicity in non-target organisms,  eventually entering the food chain. However, little information is available in  the current literature about the toxicity of iprodione to cardiac development.  The present study aimed to investigate the effect of iprodione on early embryonic  development and its cardiotoxicity in aquatic animals, using zebrafish as a  model. At 6-72 h post-fertilization (hpf), zebrafish were exposed to  concentrations of 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 25 mg/L (72 h-LC(50) = 21.15 mg/L). We  found that exposure to iprodione resulted in yolk edema, increased mortality, and  shortened body length in zebrafish embryos. In addition, iprodione was also found  to induce edema in the pericardium of zebrafish, decrease heart rate, and cause  the failure of cardiac cyclization. Exposure to iprodione significantly increased  the accumulation of ROS and altered the activity of antioxidant enzymes (MDA,  CAT) in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, iprodione induced changes in the  transcription levels of heart developmental-related genes and apoptosis-related  genes. In addition, Astaxanthin (antioxidant) can partially rescue the toxic  phenotype caused by iprodione. Apoptosis-related genes and heart  developmental-related genes were rescued after astaxanazin treatment. The results  suggest that iprodione induces developmental and cardiac toxicity in zebrafish  embryos, which provides new evidence of the toxicity of iprodione to organisms in  aquatic ecosystems and assessing human health risks.},

Although fipronil is the most  widely used insecticide in aquatic environments, few studies have evaluated its  neurotoxicity for the sensory and motor systems of aquatic vertebrates. We  assessed the effects of acute fipronil exposure on the survival rate, number of  hair cells of lateral lines, and neurotoxicity for zebrafish (Danio rerio). In  addition, heat maps and the speed and distance of the swimming trajectory were  compared between zebrafish subjected to the sham and fipronil treatments. Western  blotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted separately to compare  expressions of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurotoxicity  related proteins in the brain tissue between adult zebrafish with sham and  fipronil treatments. Our results indicated that the survival rates and the speed  and distance of the swimming trajectory significantly decreased for adult  zebrafish exposed to fipronil. The results also suggested that the number of hair  cells of lateral lines significantly reduced for zebrafish embryos exposed to  fipronil. In histopathology and Western blotting tests, substantial oxidative  stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were observed in the brain tissue of adult  zebrafish exposed to fipronil. Our results revealed that fipronil toxicity may  impair sensory and motor systems in zebrafish because of damage to lateral hair  cells and brain tissue through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis,  which in turn result in a significantly reduced survival rate and impaired  locomotion. The behavioral responses of zebrafish exposed to fipronil toxicity  should be determined for better understanding the reliability of behavioral  biomarkers in the risk assessment of environmental toxicology.},

The results  showed that penconazole exposure caused adverse effects on zebrafish embryos,  such as autonomous motor abnormalities, heart rate slowing, and increased  deformity, resulting in significant developmental toxicity. Meanwhile, also  caused the zebrafish larvae to slow movement, the neurotransmitter content and  nervous system related gene expression significantly changed, which proved that  penconazole also caused neurotoxicity to zebrafish. Interestingly, our results  also clearly show that (+)-penconazole is significantly more toxic to zebrafish  than (-)-penconazole at the same concentration, whether it is developmental  toxicity or neurotoxicity, which suggests that we should focus on (+)-penconazole  more when conducting toxicological studies on penconazole.},

In this context, the aim of the study was to assess the potential  effects that might occur when aquatic organisms are simultaneously exposed to  multiple chemicals. For that, we have studied the acute effects of cadmium  (0.2 μg L(-1)), nickel (10 μg L(-1)) and deltamethrin (2 μg L(-1)) as individual  toxicants and as mixture on the behavioral responses, oxidative stress (SOD and  GPx), body electrolytes and trace metals profiles of zebrafish (Danio rerio). So  far the scientific literature did not report about the combined effects of  pesticides and toxic metals on zebrafish behavior using a 3D tracking system.  Compared with other studies, in the present paper we investigated the acute  effects of two heavy metals associated with a pesticide on zebrafish, in the  range of environmentally relevant concentrations. Thus, the environmental  concentrations of cadmium and nickel in three rivers affected by urban activities  and one river with protected areas as background control were measured. The  observations that resulted in our study demonstrated that deltamethrin toxicity  was significantly decreased in some of the behavioral variables and oxidative  stress when combined with CdNi mixture. Consequently, our study supports previous  works concerning the combined toxicity of environmental chemicals since their  simultaneous presence in the aqueous environment may lead to higher or lower  toxicological effects on biota than those reported from a single pollutant.  Therefore, the evaluation of toxic effects of a single contaminant does not offer  a realistic estimate of its impact against aqueous ecosystems. This study also  supports the idea that the interactions between different chemical compounds  which do not exceed the maximum permitted limits in environment may have benefits  for aquatic life forms or be more toxic.},

In this  study, the toxicodynamics of TCE in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model was  investigated through the establishment of a LC50 concentration and by monitoring  the acute developmental toxicity of ecologically relevant concentrations (0, 5,  50, and 500 parts per billion; ppb) of TCE during two different exposure lengths  (1-72 hours post fertilization (hpf) and 1-120 hpf). Acute developmental toxicity  was assessed by monitoring survival and hatching, larval morphology, larval heart  rate, and behavioral responses during an embryonic photomotor response test and a  larval visual motor response test. Embryonic exposure to TCE was associated with  decreased percent hatch at 48 hpf, altered larval morphology, increased heart  rate, and altered behavioral responses during the photomotor response test and  visual motor response test. Larval morphology and behavioral alterations were  more pronounced in the 1-120 hpf exposure length trials. The observed alterations  suggest developmental TCE toxicity is still a concern at regulatory  concentrations and that timing of exposure influences developmental toxicity.},

Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as  an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup(®). This pesticide contains several  adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3days post-fertilization and adults were  exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) or Roundup(®) (0.01, 0.065, and  0.5mg/L) for 96h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of  locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and  exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult  zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the  locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup(®) exposure  when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to  glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5mg/L, Roundup(®) at 0.065 or 0.5mg/L  reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult  zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5mg/L  of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5mg/L of Roundup(®)-treated adult zebrafish  demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup(®)  reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences  between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup(®), altering morphological  and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity  and cellular response.},

To  investigate whether other cannabis-derived compounds could also reduce seizures,  the antiepileptic effects of CBD, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidivarin  (CBDV), cannabinol (CBN), and linalool (LN) were compared in both a  chemically-induced (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ) and a DS (scn1Lab(-/-)) seizure  models. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) that were either wild-type (Tupfel longfin) or  scn1Lab(-/-) (DS) were exposed to CBD, THC, CBDV, CBN, or LN for 24 h from 5 to  6 days postfertilization. Following exposure, total distance traveled was  measured in a ViewPoint Zebrabox to determine if these compounds reduced  seizure-like activity. Cannabidiol (0.6 and 1 μM) and THC (1 and 4 μM)  significantly reduced PTZ-induced total distance moved. At the highest THC  concentration, the significant reduction in PTZ-induced behavior was likely the  result of sedation as opposed to antiseizure activity. In the DS model, CBD  (0.6 μM), THC (1 μM), CBN (0.6 and 1 μM), and LN (4 μM) significantly reduced  total distance traveled. Cannabinol was the most effective at reducing total  distance relative to controls. In addition to CBD, other cannabis-derived  compounds showed promise in reducing seizure-like activity in zebrafish.  Specifically, four of the five compounds were effective in the DS model, whereas  in the PTZ model, only CBD and THC were, suggesting a divergence in the mode of  action among the cannabis constituents.},

BPMC induced developmental toxicity with reduced motility in  larval zebrafish. The spinal cord neutrophil infiltration, increased ROS  production, caspase 3 and 9 activation, central nerve and peripheral motor neuron  damage, axon and myelin degeneration were observed in zebrafish treated with BPMC  generally in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of eight marker genes for  nervous system function or development, namely, a1-tubulin, shha, elavl3, gap43,  syn2a, gfap, mbp and manf, was significantly downregulated following BPMC  exposure. AChE activity reduction and ache gene expression suppression was also  found significantly in BPMC-treated zebrafish.

	abstract = {Triadimefon (TDF) is a triazole fungicide extensively used in agriculture that has been found as a pollutant in numerous water sources. In mammals, it inhibits  monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of  action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as  locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have  studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and  adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and  serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to  different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest  concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but  produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and  dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular  serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol  production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a  dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1  (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively.  Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated  with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not  in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness,  which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.},

TEB and DIF mixture showed additive  effect on the acute toxicity to adult zebrafish, the combined toxicity on liver  was less than the additive effect of individual TEB and DIF, and TEB and DIF  mixture also reduced the toxic effects on gonad and intestinal microflora.

Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that has been increasingly used in  agriculture. However, there are few data about its effects on non-target  organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of propiconazole in  zebrafish. The animals were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of  propiconazole (425, 850, 1700, 8500 ng/L), then submitted to the novel tank test  for behavioral analyses. The brains were collected for evaluation of oxidative  stress parameters. Exposure to propiconazole (1700 and 8500 ng/L) decreased the  number of crossings, entries, and time spent in the top, and increased the time  spent in the bottom area of the tank. We also observed an increase in the  activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in zebrafish brain exposed to  propiconazole at 425, 850, and 1700 ng/L. We conclude that propiconazole alters  normal fish behavior and disrupts oxidative status. More studies are necessary to  elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the effects of propiconazole on  non-target-organisms.},

To develop novel efficient  low-toxicity insecticides, it is necessary to determine the detailed toxic  mechanism at the molecular target level. In this work, methods including affinity  chromatography, fluorescent-labeled binding assays, and molecular modeling were  integrated to explore the binding of fipronil to GABARs in fish ( Aristichthys  nobilis) and insects ( Musca domestica). Affinity chromatography revealed that  fipronil acts on two different subunits of GABARs in fish and M. domestica.  Moreover, fluorescence assays revealed that fipronil exhibits similar affinity to  the two GABARs. The K(d) and B(max) of fipronil binding to the A. nobilis GABAR  were 346 ± 6 nmol/L and 40.6 ± 3.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. And the K(d)  and B(max) of fipronil binding to the GABAR in M. domestica brain were 109 ± 9 nM  and 21.3 ± 2.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. In addition, similar fipronil  binding positions but different binding modes were observed in docking studies  with Brachydanio rerio var. and M. domestica GABARs. These findings indicated  similar interactions of fipronil with fish and insects, leading to high toxicity.  The different binding features of fipronil between the two species might be  helpful for the design and development of highly selective insecticides with low  toxicity to fish.},

This is because, aside from the well-characterized genome  of zebrafish and the availability of a broad range of experimental and  computational research tools, they are exceptionally well suited for  high-throughput approaches. Yet, one important pharmacokinetic aspect is thus far  only poorly understood in zebrafish embryo and early larvae: their  biotransformation capacity. Especially, biotransformation of electrophilic  compounds is a critical pathway because they easily react with nucleophile  molecules, such as DNA or proteins, potentially inducing adverse health effects.  To combat such adverse effects, conjugation reactions with glutathione and  further processing within the mercapturic acid pathway have evolved. We here  explore the functionality of this pathway in zebrafish early life stages using a  reference substrate (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, CDNB). With this work, we show  that zebrafish embryos can biotransform CDNB to the respective glutathione  conjugate as early as 4 h postfertilization. At all examined life stages, the  glutathione conjugate is further biotransformed to the last metabolite of the  mercapturic acid pathway, the mercapturate, which is slowly excreted. Being able  to biotransform electrophiles within the mercapturic acid pathway shows that  zebrafish early life stages possess the potential to process xenobiotic compounds  through glutathione conjugation and the formation of mercapturates. The presence  of this chemical biotransformation and clearance route in zebrafish early life  stages supports the application of this model in toxicology and chemical hazard  assessment.},

During evolution, they have developed different anti-predator behaviours, as the  vibrational-evoked startle response and its habituation, for promoting survival  to predator's strikes. Whereas these two behaviours can be altered by the  exposure to some neurotoxicants, it is currently unknown if the exposure to  environmentally relevant concentration (ERC) of neurotoxic pollutants could  impair them. In this study thirty neurotoxic environmental pollutants from nine  chemical groups, including: herbicides; carbamate, organophosphate (OP),  organochlorine (OC), neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides; toxins; metal and  non-metal elements, have been screened at two concentrations, including one  environmental relevant concentration (ERC), for adverse effects on anti-predator  behaviours by using the Vibrational Startle Response Assay on zebrafish larvae.  Significant effects over anti-predator responses were equally observed in both  exposure concentrations. Focusing on the ERC scenario, it was found that the  startle response was the less affected behaviour, where ten pollutants from all  chemical groups except for organochlorine, neonicotinoid and pyrethroids, altered  this response. Interestingly, organic and inorganic pollutants showed opposite  effects on this response: whereas all organic pollutants decreased the startle  response, the three remaining inorganic pollutants increased it. On the other  hand, more pollutants affected habituation of the startle response of the larvae,  where thirteen of the pollutants from all groups, except for herbicides, altered  this behaviour at ERC, generally resulting in a faster habituation except for one  OP and one marine toxin, which were able to delay this response. Ultimately, only  one chemical from the OP, toxin, metal and non-metal element groups altered both  the startle response and its habituation at both ERC and WSC. These results  emphasize the environmental risk of the current levels of some neurotoxicants  present in our aquatic ecosystems, as they are high enough to impair essential  anti-predator behaviours in fish larvae.},

Here, we found that 12.5 and 25 mg/L  TM induces specifically serious hepatotoxicity but not the toxicity of other  organs in zebrafish larvae and adults. Moreover, it might triggered  hepatotoxicity by activating the caspase-3 through apoptotic pathways and  oxidative stress in zebrafish. Subsequently, this resulted in a metabolic  imbalance in the zebrafish's liver. In conclusion, our results disclosed the fact  that TM may induce severe hepatotoxicity by mediating activation of caspase-3 and  oxidative stress in zebrafish.},

The environmental behavior of  herbicide lactofen may be enantioselective and the metabolites may have high  toxic effects in individual or in combination. In this work, the enantioselective  bioaccumulation, metabolism and toxic effects of lactofen and three metabolites  (desethyl lactofen, acifluorfene, and amino acifluorfene) in zebrafish were  investigated. The antioxidase activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase,  glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase), lipid peroxidation  content were measured after exposure, and genetic toxicity was evaluated by a  micronucleus test. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) method was used to  determine the effects of the lactofen and its metabolites as well as their  combinations. The metabolites were found to have higher toxic effects, and  enantioselective toxic effects of lactofen and desethyl lactofen were observed,  with the S-enantiomer more toxic. Based on IBR values, synergistic effects  existed in combination of lactofen and desethyl lactofen, while antagonistic  effects of lactofen with acifluorfene or amino acifluorfene were observed.  Zebrafish were exposed to 0.5 mg L(-1) lactofen and the bioaccumulation were  measured during a 15 d period followed by a 7 d elimination. The half-lives of  the metabolites varied between 0.66 and 5.21 d, with bioconcentration factors  (BCFs) in the range of 39-120. The metabolic pathways of R- and S-lactofen were  found to be significantly different. The results supported our hypothesis.  Therefore, the assessment of enantiomers and metabolites in individual or in  combination should be taken into consideration in evaluating chiral pesticide  risks.},

In the  present study, the behavior responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to different  concentrations of Deltamethrin, Atrazine, and Thallium (Tl) in 15 days were  investigated using an online behavior monitoring system. The results showed that  the average behavior strength (BS) value of dark period (0.71 ± 0.16) was lower  than that of light period (0.88 ± 0.09) in the control group. Similar pattern was  observed in all other treatments with negative relationship between exposure  concentrations and mean BS values. It is concluded that the 24 h circadian  rhythms in the behavior responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) could be observed  clearly in the online biomonitoring system, and the online monitoring results  would be affected obviously in the characteristics of behavior periodicity  abnormal and time delay. Therefore, it is suggested that internal  physio-ecological characteristics of organisms must be considered once they have  the chance to play roles in bio-induced technologies. More investigations are  warranted to clear the effects of internal physio-ecological changes on the  exported results.},

To explore the potential mechanisms of thyroid dysfunction caused by  o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, thyroid hormone and gene expression levels in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were measured, and the developmental  toxicity were recorded in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish embryos/larvae were exposed  to o,p'-DDT (0, 0.28, 2.8, and 28 nM; or 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L) and p,p'-DDE (0,  1.57, 15.7, and 157 nM; or 0, 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/L) for 7 days. The genes related  to thyroid hormone synthesis (crh, tshβ, tg, nis and tpo) and thyroid development  (nkx2.1 and pax8) were up-regulated in both the o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE exposure  groups. Zebrafish embryos/larvae exposed to o,p'-DDT showed significantly  increased total whole-body T4 and T3 levels, with the expression of ugt1ab and  dio3 being significantly down-regulated. However, the p,p'-DDE exposure groups  showed significantly lowered whole-body total T4 and T3 levels, which were  associated with up-regulation and down-regulation expression of the expression of  dio2 and ugt1ab, respectively. Interestingly, the ratio of T3 to T4 was  significantly decreased in the o,p'-DDT (28 nM) and p,p'-DDE (157 nM) exposure  groups, suggesting an impairment of thyroid function. In addition, reduced  survival rates and body lengths and increased malformation rates were recorded  after treatment with either o,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE. In summary, our study indicates  that the disruption of thyroid states was different in response to o,p'-DDT and  p,p'-DDE exposure in zebrafish larvae.},

Their widespread use can lead  to soil and water contamination and potentially induce damages in the ecosystem,  producing toxic effects in non-target organisms. Despite their toxicological  potential, their effects on behavioral and biochemical parameters are not well  understood. Here we investigated the effects of the mixture of fipronil and  fungicides (MFF) pyraclostrobin and methyl- thiophanate on behavioral and  biochemical parameters of oxidative stress in adult zebrafish. Animals exposed to  the highest MFF tested concentration showed a decrease in the total distance  traveled and in the number of crossings in the different zones of the tank.  Furthermore, animals exposed to highest MFF tested concentration spent more time  in water surface. In addition, our data showed that the exposure to this  preparation promoted a decrease in non-protein thiol content as well as in  catalase activity. Finally, pesticide exposure induced an increase in the  superoxide dismutase/catalase ratio. Our results indicate that alterations in  behavioral and oxidative parameters are involved in MFF toxicity in zebrafish.  The antioxidant mechanisms analyzed were altered in concentrations that did not  affect zebrafish behavior. Therefore, the assessment of oxidative stress  parameters in zebrafish brains could be very useful to detect the early effects  of environmental exposure to the MFF.},

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model  organism widely used in different fields of research such as behavioral studies,  biochemical parameters as well as neurotoxicity research. Here, we investigate  whether the exposure to three concentrations (0.15, 15, and 45 μg/L) of IMI for  96 h alters responses in zebrafish. Oxidative stress parameters and  acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) as well as the behavioral responses of  locomotion were measured. IMI exposure decreased distance traveled in fish  exposed to the 45 μg/L. In the exploratory activity, time spent and transitions  to the top area of the water column decreased in fish exposed to all  concentrations of IMI. In addition, exposures to 45 and 15 μg/L of IMI decreased  episodes of erratic movement in the zebrafish. Exposures to IMI at a  concentration of 45 μg/L decreased the time spent in erratic movements and  increased the time spent with no movement (i.e., "freezing"). Glutathione  S-transferase (GST) activity was increased in the brain of zebrafish exposed for  96 h to concentrations of 0.15 and 45 μg/L. Brain AChE activity was reduced and  the levels of carbonyl protein (CP) increased in brain of zebrafish at  concentrations of 15 and 45 μg/L. Lipid peroxidation measured by TBARS and, also  non-protein thiols (NPSH) did not show any variation in the brain of zebrafish  exposed to IMI. Changes in the activity of cholinergic neurotransmitters in the  brain tissues of zebrafish indicate IMI toxicity. Exposures of fish over 96 h to  IMI at a nominal concentration of 45 μg/L caused more extensive sublethal  responses in zebrafish, but this concentration is well above those expected in  the aquatic environment. Studies are warranted to evaluate the effects on  behavior and biomarker responses in fish exposed over longer periods to IMI at  environmentally relevant concentrations.},

Rotenone exposed rats demonstrate  many characteristics of Parkinson Disease (PD). Oxidative stress is one of the  hallmarks of PD, being the major sources of ROS in the DA neurons. In recent  years the strong connection between the intestinal environment and the function  of the central nervous system (CNS) has gained widespread popularity. In order to  explain the mechanism underlying the GI dysfunction in PD, we aimed to  investigate oxidant-antioxidant status in the brain and intestine, as well as  locomotor activity, in rotenone exposed zebrafish. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult  zebrafish were exposed to 2 mg/L rotenone for 30 days. At the end of the  experiment, locomotor activity was determined by simple observation. Lipid  peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD),  catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined in  the homogenates. RESULTS: Locomotor activity decreased in the rotenone exposed  zebrafish. LPO increased in both brain and intestines whereas NO increased only  in the brain. Decreased GST and CAT activities were found in both tissues whereas  SOD activity decreased only in the intestines. CONCLUSION: As a conclusion, the  results of our study support the connection between gut and brain axis in  rotenone exposed zebrafish by means of oxidative stress and NO for the first time  in literature.},

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects  of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos from  3 h post fertilization to 96 hpf. A set of 2,4-D concentrations ranging from 0.32  to 80 mg/L were tested and median lethal concentration (LC(50)) at 96-h was  calculated as 2.86 mg/L. A sub-teratogenic concentrations range from 0.02 to  0.8 mg/L was then used to assess effects at ontogenic, biochemical, and  behavioral levels. The main developmental defects were tail deformities and  pericardial edema at concentrations equal or above 0.32 mg/L. Cholinesterase  activity (at 96 hpf) and larvae swimming behavior (at 120 hpf) were affected even  at the lowest tested dose (0.02 mg/L). The behavior analysis was a sensitive  endpoint, with a decrease in the swimming distance of exposed larvae during light  period. The effect of 2,4-D in ChE was translated by an inhibition of the enzyme  activity in all treated groups. These findings demonstrate that 2,4-D can alter  the cholinergic system by affecting ChE activity which may be involved in the  locomotion reduction of exposed larvae and emphasize the potential of  neurotransmission and behavioral endpoints as early warning signs of herbicides  contamination in aquatic ecosystems.},

Besides that cmlc2 was evaluated by whole-mount in situ  hybridization. Results have shown that compared with control group, 0.025 mg/L  deltamethrin could significantly disturb the cardiac development, downregulating  the expression of Scn5lab and transcriptional factors gata4 and nkx2.5,  disturbing cardiac looping, resulting in defects in cardiac morphology and  function. Moreover, deltamethrin could alter the expression levels of rest/wake  genes and cause hyperactivity in zebrafish larvae. Besides, compared with  deltamethrin group, the exogenous 0.01 mg/L spermidine and 0.232 mg/L melatonin  could significantly rescue the adverse effects of deltamethrin on the cardiac  system and neurobehavior in zebrafish.

However, the  derived toxicity and subsequent mechanisms related to their adverse effects are  not fully elucidated. In the present study, we compared the mitochondrial and  developmental toxicity of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin using  zebrafish embryo/larvae. The results showed that all three strobilurins inhibited  mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration (the potency is  pyraclostrobin ≈ trifloxystrobin {\textgreater} azoxystrobin). Behavioral changes indicated  that sublethal doses of pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin caused hyperactivity of  zebrafish larvae in dark cycles, whereas trifloxystrobin resulted in hypoactivity  of zebrafish larvae. In addition, pyraclostrobin exposure impaired the inflation  of swim bladder, and caused down-regulation of annexin A5 (anxa5) mRNA levels,  and up-regulated transcript levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a (pbx1a);  conversely, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin did not cause detectable effects  with swim bladder inflation. Molecular docking results indicated that  azoxystrobin had higher interacting potency with iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD),  prolactin receptor (PRLR), antagonistic conformation of thyroid hormone receptor  β (TRβ) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) compared to pyraclostrobin and  trifloxystrobin; pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin were more likely to interact  with the antagonistic conformation of TRβ and GR, respectively. These results may  partially explain the different effects observed in behavior and swim bladder  inflation, and also point to potential endocrine disruption induced by these  strobilurins. Taken together, our study revealed that all three strobilurins  alter mitochondrial bioenergetics and cause developmental toxicity. However, the  toxic phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of each chemical may differ, and this  requires further investigation. Pyraclostrobin showed higher mitochondrial  toxicity at lethal doses and higher developmental toxicity at sublethal doses  compared to the two other strobilurins tested. These results provide novel  information for toxicological study as well as risk assessment of strobilurin  fungicides.},

	abstract = {Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is an emerging global concern affecting several agricultural communities in the Americas and South Asia.  Environmental contaminants such as heavy metals (e.g., Cd, As, Pb, and V) and  organic pesticides (e.g., glyphosate) in the drinking water have been  hypothesized to play a role in childhood onset and progression of this disease.  However, a comprehensive analysis of chemical contaminants in the drinking water  and effects of these compounds and their mixtures on kidney development and  function remains unknown. Here, we conducted targeted and non-targeted chemical  analyses of sediment and drinking water in CKDu affected regions in Sri Lanka,  one of the most affected countries. Using zebrafish Danio rerio, a toxicology and  kidney disease model, we then examined kidney developmental effects of exposure  to (i) environmentally derived samples from CKDu endemic and non-endemic regions  and (ii) Cd, As, V, Pb, and glyphosate as individual compounds and in mixtures.  We found that drinking water is contaminated with various organic chemicals  including nephrotoxic compounds as well as heavy metals, but at levels considered  safe for drinking. Histological studies and gene expression analyses examining  markers of kidney development (pax2a) and kidney injury (kim1) showed novel metal  and glyphosate-metal mixture specific effects on kidney development.  Mitochondrial dysfunction is directly linked to kidney failure, and examination  of mixture specific mitochondrial toxicity showed altered mitochondrial function  following treatment with environmental samples from endemic regions.  Collectively, we show that metals in drinking water, even at safe levels, can  impede kidney development at an early age, potentiating increased susceptibility  to other agrochemicals such as glyphosate. Drinking water contaminant effects on  mitochondria can further contribute to progression of kidney dysfunction and our  mitochondrial assay may help identify regions at risk of CKDu.},

However, far too little attention was  paid to the mechanism of FEN-induced neurotoxicity. Thus we exposed zebrafish to  FEN from 4 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf), and analyzed the morphology and  behavior of zebrafish. Our results showed that FEN decreased the survival rate of  zebrafish, with increased malformation rates and abnormal behaviors. Furthermore,  we found typical parkinson-like symptoms in FEN-exposed zebrafish with increases  in parkinson's disease (PD), ubiquitin, and Lewy bodies-relevant genes. We also  observed the loss of dopaminergic neurons in both FEN-exposed zebrafish and  PC12 cells, which were all associated with PD-like symptoms. Besides, FEN  activated autophagy by the enhanced expressions of p-mTOR, and LC3-II but the  reduction of p62. Further, FEN initially activated p-p38 MAPK followed by p-mTOR,  which triggered the transcription of genes responsible for autophagy process and  prompted the Lewy bodies neuron generation leading to the PD-like symptoms. This  process was inhibited by both 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and  SB203580 (a p38 MAPK selective inhibitor) in zebrafish and PC12 cells. These  results suggest that FEN might cause parkinson-like symptom during zebrafish  development through induction of autophagy and activation of p38 MAPK/mTOR  signaling pathway. The study revealed the potential mechanism of FEN-induced  neurotoxicity and should give new insights into a significant environmental risk  factor of developing parkinson's disease.},

Exposure to thifluzamide induced pronounced  changes in embryo brain and melatonin levels. The mRNA levels of genes related to  circadian rhythms were apparently altered. Among these, the transcripts of cry1ba  and clock1 were extremely correlated with exposure concentrations.

Sixteen metabolites of pyriproxyfen in zebrafish were identified.  Hydroxylation, ether linkage cleavage and oxidation in phase I metabolism,  followed by sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation. The bioconcentration factors  ranged from 1175 to 1246. Hydroxylation metabolites of pyriproxyfen showed  enantioselective behavior in zebrafish with enantiomer fractions (EFs) of 4'-OH-  pyriproxyfen and 5″-OH- pyriproxyfen ranged from 0.50 to 0.71. Toxicological  indexes including acute toxicity, joint toxicity and oxidative stress were  tested. Among all the metabolites, 4'-OH- pyriproxyfen was found 2 folds more  toxic to zebrafish than pyriproxyfen. (-)-Pyriproxyfen was found 2 folds more  toxic than rac- and (+)-pyriproxyfen. Antagonistic effects were found in binary  joint toxicity of pyriproxyfen and its hydroxylated metabolites. Pyriproxyfen and  its metabolites also showed oxidative stress damage by inhibiting the activity of  CAT and SOD and increasing MDA.

	abstract = {Esfenvalerate is a pyrethroid insecticide used widely for agricultural and residential applications. This insecticide has been detected in aquatic  environments at concentrations that can induce sub-lethal effects in organisms.  In this study, zebrafish embryos were used to examine the effects of  environmentally-relevant concentrations of esfenvalerate on development and  behavior. It was hypothesized that esfenvalerate exposure would impair locomotion  due to its effects on the central nervous system. We also measured mitochondrial  bioenergetics and the expression of genes (dopamine system) as putative  mechanisms of locomotor impairment. Concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 μg/L  esfenvalerate did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in zebrafish,  but there was an acceleration in hatching time for zebrafish exposed to 2 μg/L  esfenvalerate. As an indicator of neurotoxicity, the Visual Motor Response (VMR)  test was conducted with 5, 6, and 7 dpf zebrafish after continuous exposure, and  higher concentrations were used (4 and 8 μg/L esfenvalerate) to better discern  age-and dose dependent responses in behavior. Experiments revealed that, unlike  the other stages, 6 dpf larvae showed evidence for hypo-activity with  esfenvalerate, suggesting that different stages of larval development may show  increased sensitivity to pyrethroid exposure. This may be related to  age-dependent maturation of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that  reduced larval activity may be associated with impaired production of ATP and the  function of mitochondria at earlier life stages, however dramatic alterations in  oxidative phosphorylation were not observed. Based on evidence that dopamine  regulates behavior and studies showing that other pyrethroids affect dopamine  system, we measured transcripts involved in dopaminergic signaling. We found that  dopamine active transporter was down-regulated with 0.2 μg/L esfenvalerate.  Lastly, we comprehensively summarize the current literature ({\textgreater}20 studies)  regarding the toxicity of pyrethroids in zebrafish, which is a valuable resource  to those studying these pesticides. This study demonstrates that esfenvalerate at  environmentally-relevant levels induces hypoactivity that are dependent upon the  age of the zebrafish, and these behavioral changes are hypothesized to be related  to impaired dopamine signaling.},

Zebrafish  embryos were exposed to 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM from 5.5 to 72 h  post-fertilization (hpf), respectively. Consequently, SM exposure resulted in  increasing the mortality rate and reducing hatching rate in larval zebrafish at  10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells  (neutrophils and macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent  manner. The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-10,  and TGF-β) were measured to estimate immune responses. Anti-inflammatory factors  (IL-10 and TGF-β) were down-regulated in all the treated groups and significantly  altered at 40 mg/L exposure group. Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that  SM treatment significantly increased the total distance, average speed, and  maximum acceleration of larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and  subsequently enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The  content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS level in  all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were significantly  increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration group induced the  substantial increment (P {\textless} 0.001) of apoptosis-related genes including p53,  Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3.

Here, we determined the potential  toxicity of four commonly used strobilurins (azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl,  pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin) on mitochondrial function and locomotor activity  of larval zebrafish at an environmentally relevant level. As the mode of action  of strobilurins in fungi is binding to cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex  III, we evaluated exposure effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of  zebrafish, by measuring oxygen consumption rates, mitochondria-related enzyme  activities, and transcripts levels for genes associated with the electron  transfer chain and citric acid cycle. We found that 50 nM pyraclostrobin and  trifloxystrobin lowered basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP respiration,  and maximal respiration of embryos. Dysfunction in mitochondrial bioenergetics  was associated with changes in mitochondrial complex III activity and transcripts  of oxidative respiration and stress-related genes. Lower activity of complex III,  and reduced cytb mRNA levels were hypothesized to contribute to reduced electron  supply to complex IV and V. Both coxI and atp6 were up-regulated, suggesting a  compensatory response to impaired oxidative respiration. Cluster analysis  indicated that strobilurin-induced oxidative stress and cytb transcript were  related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. We also assessed larval behavior  responses, as reduced ATP can affect activity. We observed that pyraclostrobin  and trifloxystrobin induced hypoactive responses in zebrafish. At 50 nM,  azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl exerted no effects on mitochondrial function nor  locomotion of zebrafish. Studies such as this are important for determining  sublethal toxicity to these fungicides, as widespread detection of strobilurins  in aquatic environments suggests there is a potential for adverse effects in  aquatic organisms.},

In  this study, we aimed to explore the mixture toxic effects of fludioxonil (FLU)  and triadimefon (TRI) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) by employing different  toxicological endpoints. Results revealed that the 96-h LC(50) values of FLU to  D. rerio at multiple developmental stages ranged from 0.055 (0.039-0.086) to 0.61  (0.33-0.83) mg L(-1), which were less than those of TRI ranging from 3.08  (1.84-5.96) to 9.75 (5.99-14.78) mg L(-1). Mixtures of FLU and TRI exerted  synergistic effects on embryonic zebrafish. Activities of total superoxide  dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) were markedly altered in most of the  individual and pesticide mixture treatments compared with the control. The  expressions of 16 genes involved in oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, immune  system and endocrine system displayed that embryonic zebrafish were affected by  the individual pesticides and their mixtures, and greater variations of four  genes (ERɑ, Tnf, IL and bax) were found when exposed to pesticide mixtures  compared with their individual compounds. Therefore, more studies on mixture  toxicities among different pesticides should be taken as a priority when  evaluating their ecological risk.},

Materials and methods: Adult zebrafish were exposed to rotenone and mitoquinone  for 30 days. Biochemical parameters were determined by spectrophotometric method  and Parkinson's disease-related gene expressions were determined by reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Measurement of neurotransmitters  was performed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry instrument. The  accumulation of synuclein was demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining. In  vitro thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide method was applied to determine the  mitochondrial function of synaptosomal brain fractions using rotenone as a  neurotoxic agent and mitoquinone and oleandrin as neuroprotective agents.  Results: Mitoquinone improved the oxidant-antioxidant balance and  neurotransmitter levels that were disrupted by rotenone. Mitoquinone also  ameliorated the expressions of Parkinson's disease-related gene expressions that  were disrupted by rotenone. According to thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay  results, mitoquinone and oleandrin increased mitochondrial function which was  decreased due to rotenone exposure.

Enantioselective toxicity was  observed, with the S-ethiprole (924 μg L(-1)) being more toxic than R-ethiprole  (2195 μg·L(-1)). Rac-ethiprole and M2 could induce oxidative stress in the liver  of adult zebrafish and developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish  were exposed to 100 μg L(-1) rac-/R-/S-ethiprole and the bioaccumulation was  monitored during a 21 d period followed by a 7 d metabolism. The bioconcentration  factor (BCF) of rac-ethiprole was 17, and the half-lives of rac-ethiprole and  metabolites varied between 0.44 and 2.99 d. R-ethiprole was preferentially  accumulated and metabolized in zebrafish. Besides, the metabolic pathways of R-  and S-ethiprole were found to be different. This study indicated assessment of  metabolites and enantioselectivity should be taken into consideration in  evaluating environmental risks of ethiprole.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Voltage-gated potassium channels of the KCNQ (Kv7) family are targeted by a variety of activator compounds with therapeutic potential for treatment of  epilepsy. Exploration of this drug class has revealed a variety of effective  compounds with diverse mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to clarify functional  criteria for categorization of Kv7 activator compounds, and to compare the  effects of prototypical drugs in a zebrafish larvae model. METHODS: In vitro  electrophysiological approaches with recombinant ion channels were used to  highlight functional properties important for classification of drug mechanisms.  We also benchmarked the effects of representative antiepileptic Kv7 activator  drugs using behavioral seizure assays of zebrafish larvae and in vivo Ca(2+)  imaging with the ratiometric Ca(2+) sensor CaMPARI. RESULTS: Drug effects on  channel gating kinetics, and drug sensitivity profiles to diagnostic channel  mutations, were used to highlight properties for categorization of Kv7 activator  drugs into voltage sensor-targeted or pore-targeted subtypes. Quantifying  seizures and ratiometric Ca(2+) imaging in freely swimming zebrafish larvae  demonstrated that while all Kv7 activators tested lead to suppression of neuronal  excitability, pore-targeted activators (like ML213 and retigabine) strongly  suppress seizure behavior, whereas ICA-069673 triggers a seizure-like hypermotile  behavior. SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests criteria to categorize antiepileptic  Kv7 activator drugs based on their underlying mechanism. We also establish the  use of in vivo CaMPARI as a tool for screening effects of anticonvulsant drugs on  neuronal excitability in zebrafish. In summary, despite a shared ability to  suppress neuronal excitability, our findings illustrate how mechanistic  differences between Kv7 activator subtypes influence their effects on heteromeric  channels and lead to vastly different in vivo outcomes.},

However, toxic effects of pesticide mixtures on aquatic organisms and its potential  underlying mechanism still remain unclear. The joint effects of fenpropathrin  (FEN) and paclobutrazol (PAC) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) using diverse  toxicological endpoints were investigated in the current work. Our data exhibited  that the 96-h LC(50) values of FEN to zebrafish at multiple life phases ranged  from 0.0029 (0.0013-0.0042) to 0.16 (0.082-0.23) mg a.i.

Activities of T-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD and CYP450 were remarkably changed in  the majority of single and mixture treatments by comparison to the untreated  group. The mRNA levels of 17 genes related to oxidative stress, cellular  apoptosis, immune system and endocrine system were assessed, and the data  suggested that embryonic zebrafish were affected by both single pesticides and  their mixtures. Five genes (P53, tsh, ERα, crh and cxcl-clc) showed greater  alterations when exposed to pesticide mixtures by comparison to their individual  chemicals. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to conduct more studies on mixture  toxicities of different pesticides to explore the chemical mixtures with  synergistic interactions.},

Thus, the aim of the present study was to  investigate the chiral bioaccumulation behavior of tebuconazole in zebrafish  (Danio rerio). Two exposure concentrations (0.107 and 1.07 mg/L) of tebuconazole  were used. The uptake experiments lasted for 8 days, and subsequently, the  zebrafish were transferred to another clean tank containing water without  tebuconazole for depuration experiments (up to 14 days). A significant trend in  enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed in these zebrafish with the  preferential accumulation of (-)-R-tebuconazole at two dose levels. The results  of the depuration experiments indicated that the degradation of  (-)-R-tebuconazole in zebrafish was slower than that of (+)-S-tebuconazole. The  BCFk values for (+)-S-tebuconazole and (-)-R-tebuconazole in a low dose of this  chemical were 11.22 and 16.25, respectively, while at a high dose, these values  were 9.79 and 10.31, respectively. The enantiomer fraction of tebuconazole in  zebrafish and water ranged from 0.31-0.49. Hence, future research should focus on  the fate of tebuconazole in the aquatic environment at the enantiomer levels.},

Hence, there is an unmet need for fast, sensitive, and  cost-effective alternate models to reliably predict toxicity. As part of Tox21  Phase III's effort, a 90-compound library was created and made available to  researchers to screen for neurotoxicants using novel technology and models. The  chemical library was evaluated in zebrafish in a dose-range finding test for  embryo-toxicity (ie, mortality or morphological alterations induced by each  chemical). In addition, embryos exposed to the lowest effect level and  nonobservable effect level were used to measure the internal concentration of the  chemicals within the embryos by bioanalysis. Finally, considering the lowest  effect level as the highest testing concentration, a functional assay was  performed based on locomotor activity alteration in response to light-dark  changes. The quality control chemicals included in the library, ie, negative  controls and replicated chemicals, indicate that the assays performed were  reliable. The use of analytical chemistry pointed out the importance of measuring  chemical concentration inside embryos, and in particular, in the case of negative  chemicals to avoid false negative classification. Overall, the proposed approach  presented a good sensitivity and supports the inclusion of zebrafish assays as a  reliable, relevant, and efficient screening tool to identify, prioritize, and  evaluate chemical toxicity.},

This study investigated metabolic and synaptic impairments  triggered by pyriproxyfen using zebrafish acetylcholinesterase (zbAChE) and  mitochondria as markers. A brain zbAChE assay was performed in vitro and in vivo  covering a range of pyriproxyfen concentrations (0.001-10 μmol/L) to assess  inhibition kinetics. Docking simulations were performed to characterize  inhibitory interactions. Zebrafish male adults were acutely exposed to 0.001,  0.01 and 0.1 μg/mL pyriproxyfen for 16 h. Mitochondrial respiration of brain  tissues was assessed. ROS generation was estimated using H(2)DCF-DA and MitoSOX.  Calcium transport was monitored by Calcium Green™ 5 N. NO synthesis activity was  estimated using DAF-FM-DA. Brain acetylcholinesterase showed an in vivo IC(20) of  0.30 μmol/L pyriproxyfen, and an IC(50) of 92.5 μmol/L. The inhibitory effect on  zbAChE activity was competitive-like. Respiratory control of Complex I/II  decreased significantly after insecticide exposure. The MitoSOX test showed that  O(2)(-) generation had a pyriproxyfen dose-dependent effect. Brain tissue lost  50\% of Ca(2+) uptake capacity at 0.1 μg/mL pyriproxyfen. Ca(2+) release showed a  clear mitochondrial impairment at lower pyriproxyfen exposures. Thus, Ca(2+)  transport imbalance caused by pyriproxyfen may be a novel deleterious mechanism  of action. Overall, the results showed that pyriproxyfen can compromise multiple  and interconnected pathways: (1) zbAChE impairment and (2) the functioning of the  electron transport chain, ROS generation and calcium homeostasis in zebrafish  brain mitochondria. Considering the many similarities between zebrafish and  human, more caution is needed when pyriproxyfen is used in both urban and  agricultural pest control.},

	abstract = {Although organophosphate esters (OPEs) have been detected with growing frequency in water ecosystems, the underlying accumulation mechanisms of these compounds in  fish are still unknown. Here, we investigated the tissue-specific accumulation  and depuration of seven OPEs in adult zebrafish at three levels (0, 1/150 LC(50)  (environmentally relevant level), and 1/30 LC(50) per OPE congener) in laboratory  after 19 days exposure and 3 days depuration. The bioaccumulation of OPEs varied  among tissues. Muscle contained the lowest level of OPEs and liver had the  highest level of two (TPP and TCEP) of the seven OPEs at steady state. The high  levels and slow depuration rates of TDCIPP, TPHP, and TCP observed in roe  indicated that the accumulated OPEs were potentially stored in roe and  transferred to the next generation. After examination of the major metabolites  (organophosphate diesters) in selected tissues, a physiologically based  toxicokinetic (PBTK) model used in fish was adopted to explore the key factors  affecting the bioaccumulation of OPEs in zebrafish. Biotransformation of OPEs  with polychlorinated alkyl moieties (i.e. TDCIPP) and aryl moieties (i.e. TPHP  and TCP) has more significant impacts on the accumulation than those of OPEs with  alkyl or short chain chlorinated alkyl moieties. Furthermore, the partition  process between tissues and blood was also investigated, and was demonstrated to  be the dominant process for OPEs accumulation in zebrafish. This study provides  critical information on the bioaccumulation, tissue distribution, and  metabolization of OPEs in relation with OPE structures in fish, as well as the  underlying bioaccumulation mechanisms/pathways of OPEs in aquatic life.},

It is known that these  compounds impact non-target invertebrates, such as bees and gammaridae, in terms  of toxicity and behavior, but impacts and species differences on vertebrates such  as fish are little explored. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare  the effects of one widely used neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on development and  behavior of two fish model species: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka  (Oryzias latipes). Fish were exposed for 5 (zebrafish) and 14 (medaka) days from  0.2 to 2000 μg/L imidacloprid by aqueous exposure. Survival, development,  behavior and histological features were monitored and organism-internal  concentrations and biotransformation products measured. Imidacloprid caused  sublethal effects in both species but the effects were much stronger in medaka  with deformities, lesions and reduced growth being the most prominent impacts.  Due to the overall longer time of development, time-integrated exposure of medaka  was about 2-fold higher compared to zebrafish, potentially accounting for parts  of the sensitivity differences. Our results underline the importance of taking  species sensitivity differences into account especially when considering that  medaka responded at imidacloprid concentrations that have been measured in the  environment.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroids are potent neurotoxicants that may elicit multiple pathways of toxicity in non-target organisms. Comparative studies on the mechanistic and  developmental effects of types I and II pyrethroids against non-target aquatic  species are limited. This study assessed the effects of the two pyrethroid types  against embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at environmentally relevant and  laboratory concentrations. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to type-I (permethrin,  bifenthrin) and type-II (deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, fenvalerate, esfenvalerate)  pyrethroids at 1000, 10, 0.1, 0.01, 0.0 μg/L, starting at 5-h post-fertilization  (hpf) through 5-d post-fertilization (dpf) under static exposure conditions.  Swimming behavior (distance traveled and velocity) was assessed at 5-dpf. The  relative expression of Nrf2a, GST, Casp-9 and p53 mRNA transcripts, carboxyl  esterase (CES) activity and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured.  The stability of the pyrethroids across 5 days was analyzed. Bifenthrin-(10 μg/L)  and esfenvalerate-(1000 μg/L) significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced total distance  traveled by larvae while 1000 μg/L deltamethrin and λ-cyhalothrin were lethal  causing body axis curvature and pericardial edema. At environmentally relevant  concentrations-(μg/L) compared to control, permethrin-(0.122) upregulated Nrf2a  and Casp-9 expressions while λ-cyhalothrin-(0.053) downregulated Nrf2a and  fenvalerate-0.037 downregulated GST. At laboratory concentrations-(μg/L),  permethrin-(1000) upregulated Nrf2a, Casp-9 and p53 expressions, bifenthrin-(10)  upregulated Casp-9 while fenvalerate-(0.1) and esfenvalerate-(1000) downregulated  GST. There was concentration dependent increase in CES activity which correlated  positively with total ROS. Pyrethroid concentrations decreased significantly by  day 5. This study showed disparity in the mechanistic effects across the  pyrethroids types and their instability in aqueous media may underestimate  toxicity against non-target aquatic species when exposed in their natural  environment.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, studies are revealing that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can alter animal behavior. Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter  phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be  isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via  non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine  exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time,  latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain  mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b,  htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed  to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile  development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect  of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal  exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy  for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in  unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared  to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context  of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate  positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship  was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine  exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed  signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational  effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on  behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic surface and ground water contamination by chemicals is a global problem, and there is an urgent need to develop tools to identify and elucidate  biological effects. Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are not typically  monitored or regulated and those with known or suspected endocrine disrupting  potential have been termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Many CECs are  known to be neurotoxic (e.g., insecticides) and many are incompletely  characterized. Behavioral responses can identify chemicals with neuroactive  properties, which can be relevant to EDC mechanisms (e.g., neuroendocrine  disturbances). Two freshwater species, Daphnia pulex and Danio rerio, were  evaluated for swimming behavior alterations resulting from 24-hr exposure to 9  CECs: triclosan, triclocarban, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, 4-nonylphenol,  bisphenol-A, atrazine, metformin, and estrone. This is the first step in the  development of a bioassay for detecting estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic  activity with the goal to evaluate complex mixtures of uncharacterized  contaminants in water samples. The second step, described in a subsequent report,  examines transcriptome alterations following chemical exposure. Significant  differences in the swimming behavior response and sensitivity were found across  chemicals within a species and across species for a given chemical in this unique  optical bioassay system. In the concentration ranges studied, significant  behavioral alterations were detected for 6 of 9 CECs for D. pulex and 4 of 9 CECs  for D. rerio. These results underscore the utility of this bioassay to identify  behavioral effects of sublethal concentrations of CECs before exploration of  transcriptomic alterations for EDC detection.},

In this study, the  acute toxicity of procymidone, iprodione and their metabolite of 3,5-DCA toward  zebrafish was evaluated by semi-static method. The enrichment and metabolism of  procymidone and iprodione in zebrafish were also clarified. The results indicated  that procymidone and iprodione exhibited moderately toxic to adult zebrafish with  the LC(50) of 2.00 mg/L, 5.70 mg/L at 96 h. Both procymidone and iprodione could  be metabolized to 3,5-DCA in zebrafish, which showed higher toxic to adult  zebrafish with the LC(50) of 1.64 mg/L at 96 h. From the perspective of  histomorphology, for all treatment groups, the brain of the zebrafish was  significantly damaged, while the damage to gut and gills was lighter. For  procymidone, the biological concentration factor (BCF(8d)) were 236 and 246 at  the exposure concentration of 0.2 mg/L and 0.04 mg/L, and the BCF(8d) were 3.2  and 2.4 for iprodione at the exposure concentration of 0.5 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L.  Therefore, the procymidone and iprodione were moderate-enriched and low-enriched  in zebrafish, respectively.},

We aim to investigate the individual and joint effects of OPs and  PYRs exposure on zebrafish embryo by employing chlorpyrifos (CPF) and  deltamethrin (DM) as representatives. Zebrafish embryos at 2 hours post  fertilization (hpf) were exposed to CPF (4.80, 39.06, and 78.13 μg/L), DM  exposure (0.06, 1.60, and 3.19 μg/L), and CPF + DM (4.80 + 0.06, 39.06 + 1.60,  and 78.13 + 3.19 μg/L) until 144 hpf. Embryonic development, locomotor activity,  and metabolomic changes were recorded and examined. Results displayed that  individual exposure to CPF and DM significantly increased the mortality and  malformation rate of zebrafish embryos, but decreased hatching rate was only  found in CPF + DM co-exposure groups (p {\textless} .05). Meanwhile, individual CPF  exposure had no detrimental effect on locomotor activity, high dose of individual  CPF exposure decreased the swimming speed but had adaptability to the conversion  from dark to light, whereas high dose of CPF + DM co-exposure exhibited not only  significant decline in swimming speed but also no adaptability to the repeated  stimulations, suggesting deficit in learning and memory function. In metabolomic  analysis, individual CPF exposure mainly influenced the metabolism of  glycerophospholipids and amino acids, individual DM exposure mainly influenced  glycerophospholipids, and CPF + DM co-exposure mainly influenced  glycerophospholipids and amino acids. Taken together, our findings suggested the  embryonic toxicities and neurobehavioral changes caused by CPF and/or DM  exposure. The disorder metabolomics of glycerophospholipids and amino acids might  be involved in the underlying mechanism of those toxicities.},

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias  latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) are popular freshwater  animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is  generally hampered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are  not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a  comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e., anxiety-like behavior,  novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus  and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka  (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise  stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the  three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01\% v/v  carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and  Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after  subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead,  a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were  induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1)  behavioral effects are negligible when using {\textless}0.01\% v/v carrier solvents for  behavioral assessment; (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral  responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for  estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants.  In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology  research and water quality monitoring and ecotoxicological risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Due to run-off and rain events, agrochemicals can enter water catchments, exerting endocrine disruption effects and toxicity to aquatic organisms. Linuron  is a phenylurea herbicide used to control a wide variety of vegetative weeds in  agriculture in addition to residential applications. However, there are few  studies that quantify its toxicity to early developmental stages of fish. The  objectives of this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to  zebrafish embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities,  oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the Visual  Motor Response test. Zebrafish embryos at {\textasciitilde}6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were  exposed to either embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one dose of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5,  5, and 10 μM linuron for up to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) depending on the  assay. Zebrafish larvae exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac  edema, and spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using  the Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal  respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf embryos at  20 μM after a 24-hour exposure. In 7 dpf larvae, transcript abundance was  determined for 6 transcripts that have a role in oxidative respiration (atp06,  cox1, cox4-1, cox5a1, cytb, and nd1); the relative abundance of these transcripts  was not altered with linuron treatment. A Visual Motor Response test was  conducted on 7 dpf larvae to determine whether linuron (0.625 to 5 μM) impaired  locomotor activity. Larval activity in the dark period decreased in a dose  dependent manner and there were indications of hypoactivity as low as 1.25 μM.  Transcript abundance was thus determined for tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) and  glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad1b), two rate limiting enzymes that control  the production of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. The mRNA  levels of gad1b (p = 0.019) were reduced with increasing concentrations of  linuron while th1 (p = 0.056) showed a similar decreasing trend, suggesting that  neurotransmitter biosynthesis may be altered with exposure to linuron. This study  improves knowledge related to the toxicity mechanisms for linuron and is the  first to demonstrate that this anti-androgenic chemical impairs oxidative  respiration and exerts neurotoxic effects associated with neurotransmitter  biosynthesis during early development. These data are significant for  environmental risk assessment of agrochemicals.},

In this study, the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and tetrabromobisphenol  A (TBBPA) on food intake and lipid metabolism in zebrafish were determined.  Moreover, the impact of BPA and TBBPA on the endocannabinoid system (ECS) of  zebrafish was further explored by metabolomics, transcriptomics, and molecular  docking analysis. Here we show that exposure to BPA and TBBPA at concentrations  commonly found in the environment (20, 100, and 500 μg/L) led to hyperphagia and  obesity in adult male zebrafish. Metabolomics and histopathological analysis  revealed significant lipid accumulation in the liver of zebrafish exposed to BPA  and TBBPA. The expression of ECS-related genes, in conjunction with RNA-Seq  results, further indicated that BPA and TBBPA increased appetite and induced  obesity by activating cannabinoid receptor type 1(CB1). Furthermore, molecular  docking revealed that six representative BPs including BPA and TBBPA could bind  to the CB1 receptor. Collectively, these findings indicate that CB1 may be a  potential target for BPs to induce obesity.},

	abstract = {The dipyridyl herbicide paraquat induces oxidative stress in cells and is implicated in adult neurodegenerative diseases. However, less is known about  paraquat toxicity in early stages of vertebrate development. To address this gap,  zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 μM paraquat for  96 h. Paraquat did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in embryos and  larvae, but it did accelerate time to hatch. To evaluate whether mitochondrial  respiration was related to earlier hatch times, oxygen consumption rate was  measured in whole embryos. Maximal respiration of embryos exposed to 100 μM  paraquat for 24 h was reduced by more than 70\%, suggesting that paraquat  negatively impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics in early development. Based upon  this evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional responses of  oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes were measured. Fish exposed to 1 μM  paraquat showed higher expression levels of superoxide dismutase 2, heat shock  protein 70, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2a compared to  control fish. No differences among groups were detected in larvae exposed to 10  and 100 μM paraquat, suggesting a non-monotonic response. We also measured  endpoints related to larval behavior and dopaminergic signaling as paraquat is  associated with degeneration of dopamine neurons. Locomotor activity was  stimulated with 100 μM paraquat and dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor 3  mRNA levels were increased in larvae exposed to 1 μM paraquat, interpreted to be  a compensatory response at lower concentrations. This study improves mechanistic  understanding into the toxic actions of paraquat on early developmental stages.},

The present study investigated the  effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron regarding the acute  toxicity and behavior of zebrafish embryos and larvae. After conducting the fish  embryo toxicity test, three concentrations (1, 2 and 3.5 mg L(-1) for diazinon  and 1, 2 and 3.8 mg L(-1) for diuron) were evaluated for effects on embryonic  spontaneous movement and heartbeat, larval light-dark transition response, and  thigmotaxis. Although the modes-of-action are different, both pesticides proved  to be moderately toxic to early life stages of zebrafish with 96 h LC(50) of  approximately 6.5 mg L(-1) and similar EC(50) values of approximately 4 mg L(-1).  Changes in behavioral endpoints were detected 24 h of exposure, suggesting that  behavioral measurements can serve as sensitive and early indicators of pesticide  exposure. Changes in behavior, such as decrease in spontaneous coiling movements  of embryos and reduction of thigmotaxis in larvae, were pronounced for diuron,  indicating the usefulness of the application of behavioral endpoints to assess  the effects of other herbicides. In the case of diazinon, the effects were less  prominent, but the detected changes in ratios between activity in light and  darkness also point to the possibility of using behavioral changes for evaluation  of insecticide effects. The obtained results support the usage of behavioral  endpoints in zebrafish embryos and larvae for the detection of early effects of  pesticides.},

	abstract = {Thifluzamide is widely used fungicide and frequently detected in aquatic system. In this study, the toxicity of fungicide thifluzamide to non-targeted aquatic  organisms was investigated for neuroendocrine disruption potentials. Here,  zebrafish embryos were exposed to a series of concentrations of thifluzamide for  6 days. The results showed that both the development of embryos/larvae and the  behavior of hatched larvae were significantly affected by thifluzamide.  Importantly, the decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and the  increased contents of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) and  norepinephrine (NE), along with transcriptional changes of nervous system related  genes were observed following 4 days exposure to thifluzamide. Besides, the  decreased contents of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in whole body, as  well as significant expression alteration in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT)  axis associated genes were discovered in zebrafish embryos after 4 days of  exposure to thifluzamide. Our results clearly demonstrated that zebrafish embryos  exposed to thifluzamide could disrupt neuroendocrine, compromise behavior and  induce developmental abnormality, suggesting impact of this fungicide on  developmental programming in zebrafish.},

Omics  advances in ecotoxicology allow assessment on a broadest coverage of disrupted  biological pathway by mixtures. Here the usefulness of transcriptomic analyses  for evaluation of combined effects and identification of main effect components  are explored. Two artificial mixtures (Mix 1 and Mix 2) were tested by a  concentration-dependent reduced zebrafish transcriptome (CRZT) approach and  toxicity bioassays using zebrafish embryos. Then, the toxicities and  transcriptomic effects of 12 component chemicals on embryos were incorporated  into additivity models to characterize the combined effects of chemicals in  mixtures and to identify the main bioactive compounds. Mix 1 and Mix 2 displayed  similar embryo toxicities (LD(50): 6.6 μM and 8.7 μM, respectively), however, Mix  2 elicited broader biological process perturbations and 5-fold higher  transcriptome potency (point of departure eliciting a 20\% pathway response,  POD(path20)) than Mix 1. The predicted mixture toxicities derived from additivity  expectations deviated by 2-fold or less from the measured embryo toxicities  except for the Jaw defect endpoint; most biological processes deviated by 3-fold  or less. Finally, diclofenac (DFC) and propiconazole (PCZ) were identified as the  main contributing components (≥80\% explanation) to the embryo toxicity and  biological process perturbations by Mix 1. While DFC and chlorophene (CLP)  explained up to 80\% of the embryo toxicities and biological effects of Mix 2  associated with development and Metabolism processes. The CRZT approach provides  a powerful tool for assessment of biological pathways perturbed by chemicals in  mixtures and for identification of main bioactive compounds.},

However, there is little information  available on the toxicity of tralopyril to aquatic organisms. Herein, zebrafish  (Danio rerio) were used to investigate the toxicity mechanisms of tralopyril and  a series of developmental indicators, thyroid hormones, gene expression and  metabolomics were measured. Results showed that tralopyril significantly  decreased the heart-beat and body length of zebrafish embryos-larvae exposed to  4.20 μg/L or higher concentrations of tralopyril and also induced developmental  defects including pericardial hemorrhage, spine deformation, pericardial edema,  tail malformation and uninflated gas bladder. Tralopyril decreased the thyroid  hormone concentrations in embryos and changed the transcriptions of the related  genes (TRHR, TSHβ, TSHR, Nkx2.1, Dio1, TRα, TRβ, TTR and UGT1ab). Additionally,  metabolomics analysis showed that tralopyril affected the metabolism of amino  acids, energy and lipids, which was associated with regulation of thyroid system.  Furthermore, this study demonstrated that alterations of endogenous metabolites  induced the thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish following the tralopyril  treatment. Therefore, the results showed that tralopyril can induce adverse  developmental effects on zebrafish embryos by disrupting the thyroid system and  metabolism.},

	abstract = {Global use of azole fungicides is expected to increase over the next several years. Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that is used for turf protection,  residential, and other commercial applications. As such, it can enter local rural  and urban water systems via run-off and rain events. Early life stages of aquatic  organisms can be susceptible to pesticides that enter the water, but in the case  of triticonazole, data on the potential for subacute toxicity are lacking. Here,  we determined the effects of triticonazole on development, oxygen consumption  rates, and locomotor activity in zebrafish to address this knowledge gap.  Wild-type zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to  triticonazole (1-100 μM) in early development for different lengths of time  depending on the assay conducted. Triticonazole did not affect survival nor  induce significant deformity (pericardial edema, skeletal defects) in zebrafish  at doses up to 100 μM. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in embryos after 24  and 48 hour exposure to triticonazole beginning at ∼6 hpf using the XF(e) flux  analyzer. Triticonazole did not affect basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP  linked respiration, FCCP-induced maximum respiration, proton leak, spare  capacity, nor non-mitochondrial respiration at doses up to 100 μM for 24 hours,  even for exposure up to 250 μM for 48 hours. To determine whether the fungicide  affected larval swimming activity, the visual motor response test was conducted  following triticonazole exposure for 6 days. Larval zebrafish exposed to  triticonazole showed hypoactivity in the dark following a 100 μM treatment,  suggesting that the fungicide can affect the locomotor activity of zebrafish,  albeit at relatively high levels. Given the fact that sublethal biological  responses were absent at lower environmentally relevant concentrations, we  conclude that triticonazole, relative to other triazole fungicides and types of  pesticides, exhibits a relatively low risk of toxicity to the early life stages  of fish.},

Advancement in engineering technology  (computer-based monitoring systems) increased the efficiency of quantifying  toxicity of different chemicals in an organism. The cardiovascular system  reflects internal and external stress of an organism, and electrocardiogram (ECG)  data reliably measure external stress. As ECG data can accurately reflect the  physiological conditions of organisms, and zebrafish (Danio rerio) are considered  to be good models for cardiovascular research, it is hypothesized that ECG  parameters of zebrafish could indicate the toxicity of water-borne chemicals. To  achieve this, we treated zebrafish with different concentrations of target  chemicals (CuSO(4), C(10)H(19)O(6)PS(2) and NH(4)Cl) for 48 h and ECG data were  measured. P-wave, R-wave, T-wave, PR-interval, QRS-complex and QT-interval data  were the focus of this study. The results of self-organizing maps and Pearson  correlation analysis indicate that the QRS-complex can be used as an indicator  for CuSO(4) stress. The QT-interval could be used to assess the  C(10)H(19)O(6)PS(2) stress. The QT-interval and P-wave can be used to evaluate  the NH(4)Cl stress. Responses of zebrafish ECG parameters were identical with  other vertebrate model, and were specific to toxicant types. It is proved that  zebrafish heart ECG index could be used as a potential indicator in early  detection of environmental stress.},

Studies have found that carbofuran posed potential risks for  the neurotransmitter systems of non-target species, we speculated that these  disruptive effects on the neurotransmitter systems could trigger anxiety-like  behaviors. In this study, female zebrafish were exposed to environmental levels  (5, 50, and 500 μg/L) of carbofuran for 48 h to evaluate the effects of  carbofuran on anxiety-like behaviors. Results showed that zebrafish exhibited  more anxiety-like behaviors which proved by the observed higher bottom trend and  more erratic movements in the novel tank after carbofuran treatment. In order to  elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of carbofuran-induced  anxiety-promoting effects, we measured the levels of neurotransmitters,  precursors, and major metabolites, along with the level of gene expression and  the enzyme activities involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. The  results demonstrated that acute carbofuran exposure stimulated the mRNA  expression and enzyme activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, which sequentially  induced the increased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Tyrosine hydroxylase  inhibitor relieved the anxiety-related changes induced by carbofuran, confirming  the overactive tyrosine hydroxylase-mediated accumulation of dopamine and  norepinephrine in the brain was one of the main reasons for carbofuran-induced  anxiety-like behaviors in the female zebrafish. Overall, our study indicated the  environmental health risks of carbamate pesticide in inducing neurobehavioral  disorders and provided novel insights into the investigation of the relevant  underlying mechanisms.},

At  72 hpf, the body length of larvae shortened, the head and eye area decreased, and  the hatching rate increased. Acridine orange staining showed that treated  zebrafish larvae produced different degrees of apoptosis in the head, body, heart  and tail regions. Quantitative fluorescence intensity showed a dose-dependent  increase in apoptosis signal, indicating that deltamethrin could induce  apoptosis. Confocal images and fluorescence intensity quantification of red  fluorescent protein-labeled vascular endothelial cell and green fluorescent  protein-labeled transgenic zebrafish more clearly reflected the dose-dependent  cardiac and vascular morphology and the damage caused by deltamethrin.  Deltamethrin significantly induced vascular endothelial growth factor flk1 and  fli-1, cardiac development-related gene myl7 decreased in a dose-dependent  manner.

Due to its extensive  application, it has been detected in aquatic ecosystems, raising concerns about  its environmental impact, which is still poorly explored. The objective of this  work was to study the effects of a commercial formulation of azoxystrobin in the  zebrafish embryo model. Sublethal and lethal effects were monitored during the  exposure period from 2 h post fertilisation (hpf) to 96 hpf after exposure to  azoxystrobin concentrations (1, 10 and 100 μg L(-1)). The responses of  antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)) as well as detoxifying enzymes  (glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE)) were evaluated at  96 hpf. Similarly, glutathione levels (reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG)  glutathione), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) and anaerobic  respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) -related enzymes were assayed. At 120  hpf, larvae from each group were used for behaviour analysis. Results from this  study showed concentration-dependent teratogenic effects, particularly by  increasing the number of malformations (yolk and eye), with a higher prevalence  at the highest concentration. However, it was found that the lowest concentration  induced a high generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased activity  of SOD, GST, and CarE. In addition, GR and GSSG levels were decreased by the  lowest concentration, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative stress, which  is also supported by the increased AChE activity and absence of behavioural  changes. These findings advance the knowledge of the azoxystrobin developmental  and environmental impacts, which may impose ecotoxicological risks to non-target  species.},

OPs have been shown to have negative human health  impacts, particularly developmental neurotoxicity. However, neurotoxic impacts in  later adulthood and during the aging process are relatively uncharacterized. The  present study examined diazinon (DZN), an OP, to determine the neurobehavioral  consequences, in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction on a macroscale (whole  organism basal respiration) and on a microscale (whole organ mitochondrial  respiration), using zebrafish (ZF) as a model. One group of 14-month-old adult ZF  were exposed acutely as adults (0.4, 1.25, and 4.0 μM) for five days and tested  as adults, and another group was exposed developmentally 5-120 h  post-fertilization (70, 210, and 700 nM) and tested at larval, adolescent, adult,  and aging life stages. ZF exposed acutely as adults did not display many  significant neurobehavioral impacts or mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the  embryonically exposed ZF showed altered behavioral functions at each stage of  life which emerged and attenuated as fish transitioned from each developmental  stage to the next. Mitochondrial oxygen consumptions measurement results for  developmentally DZN exposed ZF showed significant increases in the low and middle  dose groups in organs such as the brain and testes. Overall, there is an  indication that early developmental exposure to DZN had continuing adverse  neurobehavioral and cellular consequences throughout their lives well into  adulthood and aging periods.},

	abstract = {Triclosan (TCS), one of the important bactericides, is widely used in personal care products, and its chronic exposure leads to severe toxic effects on the  growth and development of blood vessels in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Herein, we  screened out three differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-181a-5p, miR-132-3p and  miR-128-3p) by sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses of 4-96-hpf TCS-exposed zebrafish,  among which miR-181a-5p was found to regulate many signaling pathways involved in  fatty acid biosynthesis and phosphatidylimositol signaling systems. By  O-dianisidine staining, TCS-exposure resulted in decreased distribution of red  blood cells and induced blood hypercoagulable state and thrombotic effects.  Defective subintestinal veins (SIVs), and decreased branching and curvature of  blood vessels were observed with increasing TCS-exposure concentrations. After  microinjection of miR-181a-5p mimic and inhibitor, zebrafish malformation type  and percentage were prominently increased such as distorted SIV vessels along  with reduced venation and abnormal branches by ALP staining. Overexpressed  miR-181a-5p had a greater effect on development and branching patterns of  arteries and veins than its knockdown. By laser confocal microscopy observation,  the 72-hpf Tg (flk1: mCherry) zebrafish obviously displayed vascular  proliferation and ablation in the miR-181a-5p mimic group. Microinjection of  miR-181a-5p mimics and inhibitors led to abnormal expressions (20-50\%) of two key  target genes (pax2a and vash2) by WISH, and increased malformation percentages  (18-45\%) by IOD analysis. Overexpression of vash2 led to the inhibitory or  promoting effects on the expression of PI3K signaling pathway-related genes,  proving that the effect of vash2 on development of blood vessels could be  realized by inhibiting PI3K signaling pathway. These observations lay theoretical  foundation for deep insight into the molecular mechanisms on TCS-induced  cardiovascular diseases.},

However, little information is available in the  literature to show the toxicity of Pyrimethanil to cardiac development. In this  study, we used an experimental animal model to explore the developmental and  cardiac toxicity of Pyrimethanil in aquatic vertebrates; we exposed zebrafish  embryos to Pyrimethanil at concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 mg/L from 5.5 to 72 h  post fertilisation. We found that Pyrimethanil caused a decrease in the hatching  rate, heart rate, and survival rate of zebrafish embryos. Pyrimethanil exposure  also resulted in pericardial and yolk sac edema, spinal deformity, and heart loop  failure. Moreover, Pyrimethanil increased reactive oxygen stress levels and  heightened the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Alterations were  induced in the transcription of apoptosis-related genes (p53, Bax, Bcl2, Casp 9,  and Casp6l1) and heart development-related genes (Tbx2b, Gata4, Myh6, Vmhc, Nppa,  Bmp2b, Bpm 4, and Bpm 10). Our data showed that the activation of Wnt signalling  by BML-284 could partially rescue the malformed phenotype caused by Pyrimethanil.  Our results provide new evidence for Pyrimethanil's toxicity and the danger of  its residues in the environment and agricultural products.},

In the present study, we compared the off-target toxicity of  tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using embryo-larval zebrafish as a  model. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative toxicity of  tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using multiple-level endpoints such  as behavioral endpoints and enzymatic and molecular biomarkers associated with  their mode of action. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoles at environmentally  relevant and high concentrations, 0.3, 1.0, and 1000 µg/L, starting at 5 h  postfertilization (hpf) up to 48 hpf, as well as 5 d postfertilization (dpf).  Relative mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 family 51  lanosterol-14α-demethylase, glutathione S-transferase, caspase 9, phosphoprotein  p53, and BCL2-associated X protein were measured to assess toxicity attributable  to fungicides at the mRNA level, whereas caspase 3/7 (apoptosis) and  3,4-methylene​dioxy​amphetamine (lipid peroxidation) levels were measured at the  enzymatic level. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was measure through the  Mito Stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 at 48 hpf. In addition, light to dark  movement behavior was monitored at 5 dpf using Danio Vision® to understand  adverse effects at the organismal level. There was no significant difference in  the light to dark behavior with exposure to azoles compared to controls. The  molecular biomarkers indicated that propiconazole and myclobutanil induced lipid  peroxidation, oxidative stress, and potentially apoptosis at environmentally  relevant concentrations (0.3 and 1 µg/L). The results from the mitochondrial  respiration assay indicated a slight decrease in spare respiratory capacity with  an acute exposure (48 hpf) to all 3 azoles at 1000 µg/L. Based on the present  results, propiconazole and myclobutanil are acutely toxic compared to  tebuconazole in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations.

The half-lives of some pesticides are relatively long and may have  the dire potential to induce adverse effects when released into the soil,  terrestrial and aquatic systems. To assess the potential adverse effects of  pesticide pollution in the aquatic environment, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and  Daphnia magna are two excellent animal models because of their transparent  bodies, relatively short development processes, and well-established genetic  information. Moreover, they are also suitable for performing high-throughput  toxicity assays. In this study, we used both zebrafish larvae and water flea  daphnia neonates as a model system to explore and compare the potential toxicity  by monitoring locomotor activity. Tested animals were exposed to 12 various types  of pesticides (three fungicides and 9 insecticides) for 24 h and their  corresponding locomotor activities, in terms of distance traveled, burst  movement, and rotation were quantified. By adapting principal component analysis  (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis, we were able to minimize data  complexity and compare pesticide toxicity based on locomotor activity for  zebrafish and daphnia. Results showed distinct locomotor activity alteration  patterns between zebrafish and daphnia towards pesticide exposure. The majority  of pesticides tested in this study induced locomotor hypo-activity in daphnia  neonates but triggered locomotor hyper-activity in zebrafish larvae. According to  our PCA and clustering results, the toxicity for 12 pesticides was grouped into  two major groups based on all locomotor activity endpoints collected from both  zebrafish and daphnia. In conclusion, all pesticides resulted in swimming  alterations in both animal models by either producing hypo-activity,  hyperactivity, or other changes in swimming patterns. In addition, zebrafish and  daphnia displayed distinct sensitivity and response against different pesticides,  and the combinational analysis approach by using a phenomic approach to combine  data collected from zebrafish and daphnia provided better resolution for  toxicological assessment.},

Various environmental pollutants of distinct physicochemical  properties are able to impair the retinal development and function of teleost  fishes, including dioxin-like pollutants, flame retardants, pesticides,  perfluoroalkyl acids, retinoic acids and metals. Considering the availability of  developmental and functional database, zebrafish has been the most frequently  used as the teleost model to study aquatic visual toxicology. A diversity of  visual deficits has been displayed for fishes across multiple levels of  biological organizations (e.g., molecule, cell, histology, physiology and  behavior). Covering sensitive developmental windows of eyes during early  embryogenesis, acute or chronic exposure to xenobiotics can disturb the  expressions of visual gene and protein markers, which affect the retinal  neurogenesis and induce degeneration of neurons. Morphological structures and  physiological responses of retina and optic tectum are then disorganized,  eventually compromising the performance of visually-mediated behaviors and  recruitment of individuals. Environmental pollutants can cross the blood-retina  barrier and accumulate in eyes, which might impact visual system directly. In  addition, pollutants are very likely to interrupt retinal development and  function indirectly by disturbing the signaling of retinoids and thyroid.  However, exact mechanisms of visual toxicity are largely unknown currently. In  this review, the development and structure of retina and available tools for  studying visual science are described briefly. Advances in visual toxicology are  summarized in detail and outlooks for future visual toxicity studies are  discussed.},

The present study aimed to investigate the  toxicity mechanisms of Regent® 800 WG (a.i. fipronil) and DMA® 806 BR (a.i.  2,4-D) pesticides using forced and non-forced exposures through an integrative  approach: firstly, to assess whether contamination by fipronil and 2,4-D can  trigger the avoidance behavior of the fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) and  Hyphessobrycon eques (serpae tetra or mato-grosso). Additionally, the effects on  fish were analyzed considering the swimming behavior together with a biomarker of  neurotoxicity, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In avoidance tests  with pesticide gradients, D. rerio avoided the highest concentrations of the two  compounds and H. eques avoided only the highest concentration of 2,4-D. The  swimming behavior (distance moved) was reduced and AChE was inhibited when  D. rerio was exposed to fipronil. The 2,4-D affected the swimming (maximum speed)  of H. eques, but AChE was not altered. Avoidance response seemed not to have been  affected by possible effects of contaminants on swimming behavior and Ache  activity. This study showed the importance of knowing the avoidance capacity,  swimming behavior and neurotoxic effects of pesticides on fish in an integrated  and realistic context of exposure in environments contaminated with pesticides  and can be useful as ecologically relevant tools for ecological risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Co-occurrence of pesticides and heavy metals has attracted extensive attention. The enantioselective behaviors of dinotefuran to aquatic organisms have not been  reported, and the effects of cadmium (Cd) was absent, which were investigated in  this study at environmentally relevant concentrations. The enantioselective  accumulation and elimination of dinotefuran enantiomers were observed in  zebrafish, and it had tissue specificity. The S-dinotefuran concentrations were  higher than R-dinotefuran in heads and viscera, but it was opposite in muscles.  There existed competition between S-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran, and the  existence of S-dinotefuran might decrease the accumulation and elimination of the  R-dinotefuran in zebrafish. When co-exposure to Cd and dinotefuran, the  accumulation concentrations of dinotefuran enantiomers increased in zebrafish at  the initial stage, which were opposite latterly. The accumulation concentrations  of R-dinotefuran in R + Cd treatment in fish were 3.4 times higher than those in  R-dinotefuran treatment, and the enantiomer fraction (EF) values changed from  0.484 to 0.195. The oxidative stress of S-dinotefuran on zebrafish was highest,  followed by rac- and R-dinotefuran. Co-exposure to Cd led to toxicity increase  for R-dinotefuran, the malonaldehyde (MDA) content decreased significantly in  R + Cd treatment during 7-28 days, while obvious declination of MDA contents was  found on the 28th day in R-dinotefuran treatment. Furthermore, compared to  R-dinotefuran treatment, Cd increased the relative expression of cz-sod (3.4  times), cas3 (1.6 times) and p53 (5.7 times) in R + Cd treatment. The co-exposure  of Cd might alter the environmental behaviors and toxicity effects of dinotefuran  enantiomers in zebrafish, including the enantioselectivity. The effects of Cd on  accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran were greater than those on  S-dinotefuran. Thus, it is necessary to consider the effects of coexistent metals  to chiral pesticides in ecological risk. SUMMARIZES: The enantioselective  accumulation and elimination of dinotefuran enantiomers had tissue specificity.  Cd increased the accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran in zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended  to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult  fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to  sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and  then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of  behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor  activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding.  Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl  produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included  decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of  medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial  pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity  in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall,  this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating  long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data  supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations.  Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption  responsible for the effects observed.},

In addition, concerns have been raised on the potential risks related  with environmentally realistic pesticide mixtures since risk evaluations have  traditionally been based on individual pesticides. The insecticide/acaricide  abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole are the main pesticides that are  intensively used in Brazilian strawberry crop and are hence likely to occur  simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies. The aim of the present study was  therefore to evaluate the lethal and sublethal toxicity of single and mixture  exposures of these pesticides to zebrafish early life stages (embryos and  juveniles). By comparing the derived toxicity data of the individual compounds  with that previously determined for zebrafish adults, the order of life stage  sensitivity was juvenile {\textgreater} adult {\textgreater} embryo. The pesticide mixture revealed a  dose-level dependent deviation of the independent action model, with antagonism  at low dose levels and synergism at high dose levels. Sublethal parameters  (especially those related with locomotion) were considerably more sensitive than  lethality. Subsequently, the inclusion of sublethal parameters may greatly  improve the sensitivity of FET tests and hence its suitability as a substitution  of adult fish testing in risk assessment evaluations.},

In this study, it was  observed that several developmental endpoints such as the heart beat,  hatchability, and morphological abnormalities were influenced by ATZ and its  metabolites in different developmental stages. In addition, after 5 days of  exposure to 30, 100, 300 μg L(-1) ATZ and its main chlorometabolites, the  swimming behaviors of larval zebrafish were significantly disturbed, and the  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were consistently inhibited. Our results  also demonstrate that ATZ and its main chlorometabolites are neuroendocrine  disruptors that impact the expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as  Ache, Gap43, Gfap, Syn2a, Shha, Mbp, Elavl3, Nestin and Ngn1 in early  developmental stages of zebrafish.

	abstract = {A sequence of different classes of synthetic insecticides have been used over the past 70 years. Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.},

Optimum mitochondrial function is critical during embryonic development, as they play a  key role in early signaling cascades and epigenetic programming, in addition to  sustaining an adequate energy production. Mitochondria are sensitive targets of  environmental toxins, potentially even at levels considered safe under current  regulatory limits. Most mitochondrial analyses have focused only on chemical  exposure effects in vitro or in isolated mitochondria. However, comparatively  little is known about mitochondrial effects of chemical exposure during  vertebrate embryogenesis, especially during the recovery phase following a  chemical insult. Here, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio), in a 96-well plate  system, to examine mitochondrial effects of 24 chemicals including  pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and agrochemicals. We used oxygen  consumption rate (OCR) during embryogenesis as a proxy for mitochondrial  function. Embryonic OCR (eOCR) was measured in clean egg water immediately  following 24 h of chemical exposure and subsequently for an additional 8 h. Each  chemical, dependent upon the concentration, resulted in a unique eOCR response  profile. While some eOCR effects were persistent or recoverable over time, some  effects were only detected several hours after being removed from the exposure.  Non-monotonic dose response effects as well as mitochondrial hormesis were also  detected following exposure to some chemicals. Collectively, our study shows that  mitochondrial response to chemicals are highly dynamic and warrant careful  consideration when determining mitochondrial toxicity of a given chemical.},

Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to  study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart.

To determine if the effects noted at 48h post  fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we  also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in  situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns  during early cardiac patterning stages.

Previous data indicated that it acts as a developmental  neurotoxicant and can induce transgenerational effects in non-target organisms.  However, associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study  was to investigate permethrin-related transgenerational effects in the zebrafish  model, and to identify possible molecular mechanisms underlying inheritance.  Zebrafish (F0) were exposed to permethrin during early-life (2 h  post-fertilization up to 28 days). The F1 and F2 offspring generations were  obtained by pairing exposed F0 males and females, and were bred unexposed.  Locomotor and anxiety behavior were investigated, together with transcriptomic  and epigenomic (DNA methylation) changes in brains. Permethrin exposed F0 fish  were hypoactive at adulthood, while males from the F1 and F2 generations showed a  specific decrease in anxiety-like behavior. In F0, transcriptomic data showed  enrichment in pathways related to glutamatergic synapse activity, which may  partly underlie the behavioral effects. In F1 and F2 males, dysregulation of  similar pathways was observed, including a subset of differentially methylated  regions that were inherited from the F0 to the F2 generation and indicated stable  dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling. Altogether, the present results provide  novel evidence on the transgenerational neurotoxic effects of permethrin, as well  as mechanistic insight: a transient exposure induces persistent transcriptional  and DNA methylation changes that may translate into transgenerational alteration  of glutamatergic signaling and, thus, into behavioral alterations.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the 1,2,4-triazole fungicides are widely used for crop diseases control, and their toxicity to wild lives and pollution to ecosystem  have attracted more and more attention. However, how to quickly and efficiently  evaluate the toxicity of these compounds to environmental organisms is still a  challenge. In silico method, such like Quantitative Structure-Activity  Relationship (QSAR), provides a good alternative to evaluate the environmental  toxicity of a large number of chemicals. At the present study, the acute toxicity  of 23 1,2,4-triazole fungicides to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos was firstly  tested, and the LC(50) (median lethal concentration) values were used as the  bio-activity endpoint to conduct QSAR modelling for these triazoles. After the  comparative study of several QSAR models, the 2D-QSAR model was finally  constructed using the stepwise multiple linear regression algorithm combining  with two physicochemical parameters (logD and μ), an electronic parameter (Q(N1))  and a topological parameter (X(v)PC(4)). The optimal model could be  mathematically described as following: pLC(50) = -7.24-0.30X(v)PC(4) + 0.76logD -  26.15Q(N1) - 0.08μ. The internal validation by leave-one-out (LOO)  cross-validation showed that the R(2)(adj) (adjusted noncross-validation squared  correlation coefficient), Q(2) (cross-validation correlation coefficient) and  RMSD (root-mean-square error) was 0.88, 0.84 and 0.17, respectively. The external  validation indicated the model had a robust predictability with the q(2)  (predictive squared correlation coefficient) of 0.90 when eliminated  tricyclazole. The present study provided a potential tool for predicting the  acute toxicity of new 1,2,4-triazole fungicides which contained an independent  triazole ring group in their molecules to zebrafish embryos, and also provided a  reference for the development of more environmentally-friendly 1,2,4-triazole  pesticides in the future.},

	abstract = {2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is one of the most commonly used herbicides worldwide. While the effects of 2,4-D in target organisms are well  known, its consequences in nontarget organisms are not fully explained.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the  herbicide on mitochondrial energy metabolism, oxidative status, and exploratory  behavior in adult zebrafish. Animal exposure to 2,4-D increased cytochrome c  oxidase and catalase activities and reduced SOD/CAT ratio, moreover, increased  the total distance traveled and the number of crossings. Finally, animals exposed  to 2,4-D spent more time in the upper zone of the tank and traveled a long  distance in the upper zone. Overall, our results indicate the 2,4-D can provoke  disabling effects in nontarget organisms. The obtained data showed that exposure  to 2,4-D at environmentally relevant concentrations alters mitochondrial  metabolism and antioxidant status and disturbs the zebrafish innate behavior.},

A trout (Onychorynhis mykiss) gill epithelial  cell line (RTgill-W1) was used to determine the cytotoxicity of rotenoids and  effects on cell metabolism.

The crude T. vogelii plant extract significantly decreased the cellular metabolic  activity and was cytotoxic at lower concentrations (5 and 10 nM, respectively),  while tephrosin, deguelin and rotenone showed these effects at  concentrations ≥ 50 nM. The crude T.

Results unraveled that  the 96-h LC(50) values of MYC to D. rerio at various life phases ranged from 5.2  to 10.3 mg L(-1), which were lower than those of THI ranging from 147 to  246 mg L(-1). Combinations of MYC and THI exhibited synergetic toxicity to  zebrafish embryos. The activities of antioxidative enzymes (T-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD and  POD) and detoxification enzyme (GST) were obviously varied in most of the MYC,  THI and combined exposures compared to the control. The mRNA expressions of eight  genes (Cu-sod, cas3, il-8, cxcl, erα, crh, cyp17 and dio1) involved in  antioxidation, apoptosis, immunity and endocrine were obviously altered in the  combined exposure of MYC and THI compared to their individual exposures.

Concern is now growing whether TCIPP and TCEP can cause neurotoxicity since they  have similar chemical structure with organophosphorus pesticide. Therefore, in  this study, zebrafish embryos (2-120 h post-fertilization [hpf]) were exposed to  TCIPP or TCEP (0, 100, 500 or 2500 μg/L) or a model neurotoxicant, chlorpyrifos  (CPF, 100 μg/L) to investigate the adverse effects and possible mechanisms of  TCIPP and TCEP on neurodevelopment. Our results showed that CPF exposure resulted  in developmental toxicity including decreased hatching, survival rates and  increased malformation rates (e.g., spinal curvature) as well as behavior changes  such as decreased locomotive activity in dark stimulation. In contrast, TCIPP and  TCEP showed no significant effects on developmental parameters, but caused  similar effects on locomotive activity at high concentration, indicating that  although not as potent as CPF, TCIPP and TCEP may still cause adverse effects on  neurodevelopment. Furthermore, our results suggest that TCIPP and TCEP showed no  effects on acetylcholine content or AChE activity, which were considered as the  main targets of CPF. However, TCIPP and TCEP exposure can significantly  down-regulate the expression of selected genes and proteins related to  neurodevelopment (e.g., mbp, syn2a, and α1-tubulin) similar as CPF did. Besides  that, TCIPP and TCEP can also affect the transcription of shha and gap43, which  were not affected by CPF, pointing out a complex mechanism underlying TCIPP and  TCEP's neurodevelopmental toxicity. Overall, our results demonstrated that TCEP  and TCIPP may have adverse effect on the neurodevelopment of zebrafish  embryos/larvae, but the underlying mechanism is not via the inhibition of acetyl  cholinesterase activity.},

A number of research studies have investigated the  effects of subacute developmental exposure to OP pesticides in zebrafish,  observing detrimental effects on gross morphology, neuronal development, and  behavior. Few studies, however, have utilized this model to evaluate treatments,  such as oxime reactivators, anticholinergics, or anticonvulsants, following acute  exposure. Preliminary work has investigated the effects of CWNA exposure. The  results clearly demonstrated relative toxicity and oxime efficacy similar to that  reported for the rodent model.

Here we investigated the effects of IMI and THM on locomotor  behavior, AChE activity, and transcription of genes related to synaptic  transmission in zebrafish exposed to IMI and THM with concentrations of  50 ng L(-1) to 50,000 ng L(-1) at 14 day post fertilization (dpf), 21 dpf, 28 dpf  and 35 dpf. Our results showed that IMI and THM significantly influenced the  locomotor activity in larvae at 28 dpf and 35 dpf. THM elevated AChE activity at  28 dpf. The qPCR data revealed that IMI and THM affected the transcription of  marker genes belonging to the synapse from 14 dpf to 35 dpf. Furthermore, IMI and  THM mainly affected transcription of key genes in γ-aminobutyric acid, dopamine  and serotonin pathways in larvae at 28 dpf and 35 dpf. These results demonstrated  the neurotoxicity of IMI and THM in zebrafish. The findings from this study  suggested that IMI and THM in the aquatic environment may pose potential risks to  fish fitness and survival.},

	abstract = {Farmers are often chronically exposed to insecticides, which may present health risks including increased risk of neurobehavioral impairment during adulthood and  across aging. Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to  help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult  insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we  examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an  organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an  organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed  continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 μM CPF), with short-  and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age  respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity,  tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term  effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two  weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a  longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving  responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at  14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses.  Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The  two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in  shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist  through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in  cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term  effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at  14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point.  These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic  doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be  characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a low-cost model that has a variety  of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding  of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such  toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.},

LC(50)  value was obtained by applying varying concentrations of fipronil to zebrafish  embryos for 72 h. As zebrafish embryos are useful vertebrate models for studying  developmental and genetic findings in toxicology research, they were exposed to  fipronil to study detailed elucidating mechanisms with hazardous end points of  toxicity. Cell cycle arrest-related apoptosis supported pathological alterations,  such as increased mortality, shortened body length, and reduced hatchability.  Furthermore, observed heart defects, including edema and irregular heartbeat were  caused due to abnormal blood circulation. In transgenic zebrafish models  (fli1:eGFP and olig2:dsRED), disrupted blood vessel formations were indicated by  eGFP(+) endothelial cells. Moreover, neurogenic defects were observed by studying  dsRED(+) motor neurons and oligodendrocytes.

	abstract = {Aquatic herbicides are used worldwide to eradicate nuisance and invasive plants despite limited knowledge of their toxicity to non-target organisms.  2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a common active ingredient in  commercial herbicide formulations, which triggers plant cell death by mimicking  the plant-specific hormone auxin. Application practices of 2,4-D commercial  herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This  practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full  impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it  may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem  dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio  rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing  commercial herbicide DMA4(®)IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival,  behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt  morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed  reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm  pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced  in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and  yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4  exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of  visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish  exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum  following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the  development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and  thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.},

Fish were  pretreated with a Na(2)SeO(3) diet for 21 days and then PQ (20 mg/kg) was  administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days. In the novel tank  test, the Na(2)SeO(3) diet prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the  increase in the time spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of  freezing episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced  aggression (MIA) tasks, Na(2)SeO(3) prevented the increase in the latency to  enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of PQ-treated  animals, respectively. Na(2)SeO(3) prevented the increase of carbonylated protein  (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as  the decrease in non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant  enzymatic defenses, Na(2)SeO(3) prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary  Na(2)SeO(3) improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment  in zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety- and  aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are highly persistent and ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutants. Based on their chemical structure, PCBs are  classified into non-ortho-substituted and ortho-substituted congeners.  Non-ortho-substituted PCBs are structurally similar to dioxin and their toxic  effects and mode of action are well-established. In contrast, very little is  known about the effects of ortho-substituted PCBs, particularly, during early  development. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of  exposure to an environmentally prominent ortho-substituted PCB  (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl; PCB153) on zebrafish embryos. We exposed  zebrafish embryos to 3 different concentrations of PCB153 starting from 4 to  120 hours post-fertilization (hpf). We quantified gross morphological changes,  behavioral phenotypes, gene expression changes, and circadian behavior in the  larvae. There were no developmental defects during the exposure period, but  starting at 7 dpf, we observed spinal deformity in the 10 μM PCB153 treated  group. A total of 633, 2227, and 3378 differentially expressed genes were  observed in 0.1 μM (0.036 μg/ml), 1 μM (0.36 μg/ml), and 10 μM (3.6 μg/ml)  PCB153-treated embryos, respectively. Of these, 301 genes were common to all  treatment groups. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes related to  circadian rhythm, FoxO signaling, and insulin resistance pathways. Behavioral  analysis revealed that PCB153 exposure significantly alters circadian behavior.  Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with the development of  metabolic and neurological diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of action  of environmental chemicals in disrupting metabolism and other physiological  processes is essential.},

The fungicides were monitored in aquatic ecosystems  and may have negative effects on nontarget organisms. This project was undertaken  to monitor the toxic effects of fluoxastrobin (FLUO) on Danio rerio embryos and  to evaluate the SF risks in aquatic ecosystems. The 96-hour median lethal  concentration (96 h LC(50)), hatching rates, and morphological abnormalities were  used to analyze acute toxicity and teratogenicity of FLUO to Danio rerio embryos  at an FLUO dose of 0.549 mg/L (95\% confidence limits: 0.423 to 0.698 mg/L); the  results showed that FLUO has high toxicity in embryos that is analogous to the  toxicity observed in adult Danio rerio. Fluoxastrobin may lead embryos to delayed  hatching at concentrations {\textgreater}0.6 mg/L, and it may lead to teratogenicity (i.e.,  pericardial edema and spinal curvature). Based on the 96 h LC(50) results, the  following parameters were evaluated in Danio rerio: development-related  indicators (body length and heart rates), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels,  lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, the levels of three antioxidants,  8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and apoptosis. The results elucidated that  FLUO inhibition of spinal and heart development may be induced by oxidative  stress. In addition, FLUO induced a notable climb in ROS content, LPO, the  activated activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and it  inhibited glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity. Fluoxastrobin led to DNA  damage (i.e., a notable climb of 8-OHdG contents and apoptotic cells).  Collectively, FLUO posed threats to Danio rerio embryos at multiple levels, and  this investigation could be a reminder for people to be more judicious in SF-use  to avoid or relieve SF toxicity to nontarget organisms.},

Moreover, we likewise evaluated the possible protective  effect of vitamin C (VC) supplementation against the combined acute toxic effects  of the two toxicants. Juvenile zebrafish were exposed to DM (2 μg L(-1)) and Pb  (60 μg L(-1)) alone and in combination with VC (100 μg L(-1)) and responses were  assessed by quantifying acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation  (MDA), some antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and GPx), three-dimension  locomotion responses and changes of elements concentrations in the zebrafish  body. Our results show that VC has mitigative effects against behavioral and  biochemical alterations induced by a mixture of contaminants, demonstrating that  it can be used as an effective antioxidant. Moreover, the observations in the  study demonstrate zebrafish as a promising in vivo model for assessing the  neuroprotective actions of bioactive compounds.},

	abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most commonly applied agricultural herbicide in the United States. Due to contamination concerns, the U.S. EPA has set the maximum  contaminant level in potable water sources at 3 parts per billion (ppb; μg/l).  Depending on the time of year and sampling location, water sources often exceed  this limit. ATZ is an endocrine disrupting chemical in multiple species observed  to target the neuroendocrine system. In this study the zebrafish vertebrate model  was used to test the hypothesis that a developmental ATZ exposure generates  metabolites similar to those found in mammals and alters morphology and behavior  in developing larvae. Adult AB zebrafish were bred, embryos were collected, and  exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb ATZ from 1 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf).  Targeted metabolomic analysis found that zebrafish produce the same major ATZ  metabolites as mammals: desethyl atrazine (DEA), deisopropyl atrazine (DIA), and  diaminochloroatrazine (DACT). The visual motor response test at 120 hpf detected  hyperactivity in larvae in the 0.3 ppb treatment group and hypoactivity in the  30 ppb treatment group (p {\textless} 0.05). Further analysis into behavior during the dark  and light phases showed zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had an increase  in total distance moved in the first light phase and time spent moving in the  first dark and light phases (p {\textless} 0.05). Alternatively, a decrease in total  distance moved was observed in the second and third dark phases in zebrafish  exposed to 30 ppb ATZ (p {\textless} 0.05). No significant differences were observed for  any of the morphological measurements following ATZ exposure from 1 to 120 hpf  (p {\textgreater} 0.05). These findings suggest that a ATZ exposure during early development  generates metabolite profiles similar to mammals and leads to behavioral  alterations supporting ATZ as a neurodevelopmental toxicant.},

It is  unclear if the adverse effects associated with developmental exposure to the  active CPO persist into adulthood and future generations. The goal of this study  was to investigate whether CPO-associated changes in embryo-larval zebrafish (ZF)  behavior at the F0 5 dpf were manifest throughout the life of the exposed F0, and  are inherited by subsequent generations. For this study, embryos were exposed to  chlorpyrifos-oxon at the environmentally relevant concentration of 0.01 μg/L and  a high concentration of 50 μg/L starting at 4 hpf to 5 dpf, and then raised to  F2. There was a significant decrease in distance traveled with 5 dpf F0 ZF  exposed to the 50 μg/L CPO, with alterations in noncholinergic genes CFOS and  LINGO, and alterations in global DNA methylation. CPO-related behavioral effects  were ameliorated by day 21 through the F1 generation. This trend changed with  hyperactive behavior, increase acetylcholine concentration in F2 zebrafish that  were exposed to 50 μg/L CPO during the F0 development. There was also an increase  in AChE activity and hypermethylation in F2 0.01 μg/L exposure larvae, indicating  that even low dose exposures can have transgenerational effects. Results from  this study demonstrate that early life stage exposures to CPO can lead to  epigenetic changes in neurological activity, which may lead to alterations in  response to CPO in future generations. ABSTRACT SUMMARY: This study identified a  correlation between CPO exposure during F0 development and significant  differences in F2 behavioral, AChE activity and neurotransmitter concentration.},

In this study, the  developmental toxicity of SCCPs to zebrafish embryos/larvae was evaluated, and a  metabolomics approach was adopted to explore the impact of SCCPs exposure on the  metabolism in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to SCCPs at concentrations of 1-200μg/L  did not produce an observable effect on the hatching rate and morphological  deformities of zebrafish embryos/larvae. However, the survival rate of zebrafish  larvae in SCCPs exposure groups decreased in a concentration-dependent manner.  The 13-day 50\% lethal concentration (LC(50)) value of SCCPs was calculated to be  34.4μg/L. Exposure to SCCPs induced a significant change of overall metabolism,  even at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-5μg/L). The most relevant  pathways affected by SCCPs exposure were glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty  acid metabolism and purine metabolism. Exposure to SCCPs at concentrations of  1-5μg/L had begun to accelerate the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and  very long chain fatty acids, and affect the transformation of guanine to xanthine  in the pathway of purine metabolism. Furthermore, when the exposure  concentrations of SCCPs were increased to 50-200μg/L, the levels of phospholipids  and amino acids were significantly raised; whereas the levels of fatty acids,  carnitines and inosine were significantly decreased. In view of the significant  effect on metabolism, the sub-chronic and chronic toxicity of SCCPs to fish  should be concerned.},

However, little attention has been paid to its  endocrine disrupting effect to non-target organisms. In the present study,  zebrafish was exposed to 13 and 65 μg/L of chlorpyrifos for 7 and 10 days to  determine the induced neurotoxicity and the alteration of thyroid metabolism. The  120 h LC(50) and LC(10) of chlorpyrifos was estimated as 1.35 mg/L and 0.62 mg/L  based on the acute embryo toxicity assay, respectively. The acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) inhibitory was detected by 13 μg/L chlorpyrifos and could be reversed by  the co-exposure of 100 and 1000 μg/L anticholinergic agent atropine. For thyroid  hormone level, 13 and 65 μg/L of chlorpyrifos induced increased free T(3) levels  in 10 dpf (days post-fertilization). The expression of thyroid related genes in 7  and 10 dpf exposed zebrafish were measured by the quantitative Real-Time PCR  (qRT-PCR) assay. The mRNA expression of tshba, thrb, crhb, ttr, tpo, ugt1ab and  slc5a5 had significant change. However, the alterations of thyroid hormone and  mRNA expression could be partly rescued by the addition of atropine. The  molecular docking of chlorpyrifos and T(3) to the thyroid receptor β in zebrafish  using homology modelling and CDOCKER procedures shown weaker binding ability of  chlorpyrifos compared to T(3). Therefore, we concluded that the disturbance of  thyroid signaling in zebrafish might arise from the developmental neurotoxicity  induced by chlorpyrifos.},

This study used zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to assess the  enantioselective toxicity of benoxacor and its effects on biological activity and  development from 2 h to 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). Results showed that  benoxacor had negative effects on hatchability, malformations, and mortality.  Compared to either individual enantiomer, embryos exposed to Rac-benoxacor had  higher acute and developmental toxicities, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities, and nrf 2 expression levels. They  also had lower superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  reductase (GR) enzyme activity and krt 17, tbx 16, osx, cat, bcl 2, bax, and ifn  expression levels. High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that Rac-benoxacor had  a greater effect on gene regulation than either enantiomer. Gene Ontology  enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses  demonstrated that changes in oxidoreductase activity, cellular lipid metabolic  process, and catalytic activity related genes may be due to the enantioselective  effects of benoxacor isomers. These results suggest that the ecotoxicology data  and safety knowledge about the effects of chiral benoxacor on zebrafish should be  considered in future environmental risk evaluation.},

However, there is another side of this phenomenon, which  includes side effects and environmental pollution. To avoid or minimize the  uncontrollable consequences of using the newly developed compounds, researchers  seek a quick and effective means of their evaluation. In achieving this goal, the  zebrafish (Danio rerio) has proven to be a highly useful tool, mostly because of  its fast growth and development, as well as the ability to absorb the molecules  diluted in water through its skin and gills. In this review, we focus on the  reports concerning the application of zebrafish as a model for assessing the  impact of toxicants on skeletal muscles, which share many structural and  functional similarities among vertebrates, including zebrafish and humans.},

In this study, the pentylenetetrazole seizure test  (PTZ) was performed to assess the effectiveness of four new ASDs: lamotrigine  (LTG), topiramate (TPM), felbamate (FBM), and levetiracetam (LEV) in the  subsequent stages of seizures in adult fish. All ASDs were administered  intraperitoneally (i.p.). The time of maximal anticonvulsant effect and the  dose-response relationship of the drugs were assessed. The effects of studied  ASDs on the locomotor activity and the anxiety-like behavior in the color  preference test were also investigated. Furthermore, drug concentrations in  zebrafish homogenates were determined. LTG, TPM, and LEV significantly increased  the seizure latency at three subsequent stages of seizures (SI-SIII), while FBM  was effective only at SI. Locomotor activity decreased after TPM treatment. TPM  and FBM exhibited a strong anxiolytic-like effect in the color preference test.  LEV at the highest dose tested had a weak anxiolytic-like effect. The HPLC  analysis showed average concentrations of the studied ASDs in the fish body  during their maximum anticonvulsant activity. The present study shows that FBM  cannot inhibit all subsequent PTZ seizure stages in the adult fish. Except for  LTG, the studied drugs affected the anxiety-like behavior of treated animals.  Furthermore, only TPM significantly changed locomotion parameters. Our findings  support the need to accurately characterize the efficacy of new ASDs at different  stages of the PTZ-induced seizures in adult zebrafish.},

Exposure to bifenazate was found to cause severe  cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, along with disorders in the gene expression  related to heart development. Bifenazate also caused oxidative stress.  Cardiotoxicity caused by bifenazate was partially rescued by astaxanthin (an  antioxidant), accompanied by cardiac genes and oxidative stress-related  indicators becoming normalized. Our results showed that exposure to bifenazate  can significantly change the ATPase activity and gene expression levels of the  calcium signaling pathway. These led to heart failure, in which the blood  accumulated outside the heart without entering it, eventually leading to death.  The results indicated that bifenazate exposure caused cardiotoxicity in zebrafish  embryos through the induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of the calcium  signaling pathway.},

Increasing  evidence on human exposure to and environmental contamination with  organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) requires an adequate toxicity  assessment for this class of chemicals. While developmental toxicity of several  OPFRs has been reported, developmental effects of OPFR metabolites have still to  be understood. The present study aimed at characterizing developmental effects of  OPFR metabolites using zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Triphenyl phosphate  (TPHP) and two of its metabolites, 3-hydroxylphenyl diphenyl phosphate and  4-hydroxylphenyl diphenyl phosphate, were most potent for inducing pericardial  edema and reduction in blood flow in trunk vessels. Other TPHP metabolites, such  as diphenyl phosphate and 4-hydroxylphenyl phenyl phosphate, showed no  substantial increase in circulatory failure at concentrations up to 30 μM. Tris  (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate showed circulatory failure at 30 μM, but its  metabolite bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate did not. Neither  tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate nor its metabolite bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate,  induced circulatory failure. The circulatory failure appeared to be enhanced with  the increase in the octanol-water partition coefficients of OPFRs and their  metabolites, suggesting that developmental circulatory failure posed by these  chemicals could be estimated by their bioaccumulative potential. The present  study demonstrated developmental circulatory failure of hydroxylated TPHP  metabolites, which was almost equipotent to TPHP. Diester OPFR metabolites showed  no major developmental toxicity at the concentrations used in this study. The  current results establish the foundation for further understanding the  similarities and differences in the toxic mechanisms between OPFRs and their  metabolites.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate TAP, MAP and CF  co-degradative ability of Enterobacter sp. Z1 and study the degradation  mechanisms. Strain Z1 was shown to efficiently co-degrade TAP, MAP and CF when  they were used as primary carbon sources. The degradation occurred over a wide  range of temperatures, pH values and pesticide concentrations and followed  first-order kinetics. Under the optimum conditions (37 °C, pH 7 and 100 mg/L of  each pesticide), the degradation efficiencies were 100\%, 100\%, and 95.3\% for TAP,  MAP and CF, respectively. In addition, strain Z1 could simultaneously degrade  TAP, MAP, CF and total nitrogen in wastewater in a batch bioreactor, with high  removal efficiencies of 98.3\%, 100\%, 98.7\% and 100\%, respectively. Genomics,  proteomics, qRT-PCR and gene overexpression analyses revealed that the  degradation mechanisms involved the activities of multiple proteins, among which,  organophosphorus hydrolase (Oph) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PaaC) are  primarily responsible for TAP and MAP degradation, while carbofuran hydrolase  (Mcd) and amidohydrolase (RamA) primarily degrade CF. Among these enzymes, PaaC  and RamA are newly identified pesticide-degrading enzymes. Toxicity assays of  strain Z1 using reporter recombinase gene (recA) and zebrafish showed that there  was no accumulation of toxic metabolites during the degradation process.  Biosafety test using zebrafish showed that the strain was nontoxic toward  zebrafish. Strain Z1 provides a good purification effect for  pesticides-containing wastewater and novel microbial pesticide-degrading  mechanisms were discovered.},

	abstract = {Glyphosate is the active ingredient of some of the most highly produced and used herbicides worldwide. The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides  and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems.  Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including  autism-related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L)  concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant  concentrations of this compound (ng/L to μg/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this  study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after  waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 μg/L)  for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant  impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety.  The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in  dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic  acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the  dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally,  the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and  superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione  stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the  observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of  lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current  glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have  detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the  environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a  vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are  relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding  the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.},

However, the  underlying molecular mechanism at the epigenetic level is largely unknown. Based  on developmental toxicity (i.e., mortality and malformation), we measured  expression levels of mRNA genes and their targeted miRNA in zebrafish embryos  exposed to TPHP. As a result, TPHP caused developmental delay beginning at the  17-somite stage linking to detrimental effects in the tail and even embryonic  mortality. Abnormal tail development was found to be associated with  down-regulation of mmp9 and sox9b in both qRT-PCR and whole in-situ hybridization  analysis. Also, we identified two microRNAs (i.e., miR-137 and miR-141) and  observed their differential over-expression in TPHP-exposed zebrafish embryos. In  the microinjection of miR-137 and miR-141 inhibitors, the reduced expression of  mmp9 and sox9b upon TPHP exposure was compensated, indicating that epigenetic  deregulation of miRNAs modulated putative genes involved in phenotypic tail  defects triggered by TPHP in developing zebrafish embryos.

In this study, we examined the toxic effects of  various concentration of PM on the endpoints of development, locomotor behavior  and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. It was observed that PM exposure  delayed embryonic development, inhibited hatchability at 60 and 72 h  postfertilization and increased heart rate. After PM exposure, the larval  zebrafish showed abnormal free swimming behavior and the swimming behavior in  response to light-dark transition, indicating that PM had the potential to induce  neurotoxicity. Moreover, PM exposure also affected the enzymatic activity of  acetylcholinesterase and dopamine and the transcriptional level of genes related  to neurotoxicity. In addition, PM exposure not only affects catalase (CAT),  glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity but  also affects the transcription level of various genes. We believed that PM  induced oxidative stress was also a possible reason to cause neurotoxicity in  larval zebrafish. In summary, our results suggested that PM could disturb the  endpoints at development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress in larval  zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Commercial benzamide fungicides are applied to crops to control damage caused by oomycete fungi and are used as veterinary pharmaceuticals in aquaculture. The  mechanism of action of these fungicides is to induce mitotic arrest via binding  to beta-tubulin, thus inhibiting tubulin polymerization. However, there are  little toxicity data available for benzimidazole fungicides in fish. To address  this knowledge gap, we conducted zebrafish embryo toxicity tests to assess  deformities, survival, and sub-lethal responses following exposure to zoxamide  (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 μM zoxamide). We hypothesized that skeletal  deformities would be prevalent in zebrafish due to its mechanism of inhibiting  beta-tubulin polymerization. Zoxamide was relatively toxic to zebrafish embryos  and larvae, and survival was reduced ∼50 \% at 2 days post fertilization (dpf)  with 10 μM exposure and over time at 6 dpf, 2.5 μM exposure reduced survival by  ∼20 \%. Frequency of hatch was also reduced/delayed in zebrafish at 3 dpf with  {\textgreater}2.5 μM zoxamide. Pericardial edema, body length shortening, and spine curvature  were observed in larvae exposed to {\textgreater}5 μM. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were  assessed in ∼30 hpf embryos (24-hour exposure) using an XFe24 Flux Analyzer and  regression analysis revealed a negative relationship between basal respiration  and zoxamide concentration. Superoxide dismutase 1 and caspase 3 mRNA levels were  both decreased in 6 dpf larvae exposed to 2.5 μM zoxamide, but were not changed  in expression at 0.5 nor 1 μM zoxamide. Continuous 6-day exposure to zoxamide  reduced larval activity at 2.5 μM; conversely a 24-hour exposure (at 5-6 dpf)  induced hyperactivity at 5 μM suggesting dose and time dependent effects on fish  behavior. Based on sub-lethal endpoints, we conceptualize an adverse outcome  pathway for chemicals that inhibit tubulin polymerization.},

In addition,  deltamethrin could affect the sleep-waking behavior of larvae, increasing the  activity of larvae, decreasing the rest behavior and the expression of hcrt,  hcrtr, aanat2 were down-regulated.

However, data  are scarce on how propiconazole may affect early developmental life stages of  fish. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential sub-lethal  effects of propiconazole during zebrafish development. Wildtype zebrafish (ABTu  strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to propiconazole (0.1-100 μM) for up to  150 hours post fertilization (hpf) depending upon the endpoint measured.  Propiconazole decreased survival and induced hypopigmentation in fish at 100 μM  compared to the water and solvent controls. Pericardial edema was also noted in  embryos and larvae (beginning at 2-3 dpf) exposed to 100 μM propiconazole. To  visualize the effects of propiconazole on the circulatory system in more detail,  we exposed transgenic zebrafish (globin-LCR:eGFP) to the fungicide. Hematopoietic  changes were observed within 48 h of exposure to 100 μM, and localization of  blood cells in the cardic region became diffuse, indicating pooling of blood in  the pericardial region. We measured oxidative respiration in embryos as  sufficient ATP is needed for development. Exposure to 100 μM propiconazole  ({\textasciitilde}6-30 hpf) reduced basal respiration ({\textasciitilde}50\%), oligomycin-induced ATP linked  respiration ({\textasciitilde}70\%), proton leak ({\textasciitilde}30\%), and non-mitochondrial respiration ({\textasciitilde}50\%),  indicating compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. A Visual Motor Response (VMR)  test was used to measure dark photokinesis behavior in larval fish exposed to  propiconazole for a 6-day period. Larval fish exposed to the highest  concentration in the assay (10 μM) showed evidence of hypoactivity. This study  demonstrates that propiconazole can induce hypopigmentation in zebrafish, disrupt  mitochondrial bioenergetics, and can alter locomotor activity. However, these  sub-lethal responses were observed at concentrations above what is typically  detected in the environment.},

	abstract = {Pesticides are typically applied to crops as acute applications, and residual effects of such intermittent exposures are not often characterized in developing  fish. Fipronil is an agricultural pesticide that inhibits γ-amino-butyric acid  (GABA) gated chloride channels. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  were exposed for 48 h (starting at {\textasciitilde}3 h post fertilization, hpf) to various  concentrations of fipronil (0.02 μg/L up to 4000 μg/L). Following this acute  exposure, a subset of fish was transferred to clean water for a 7-day depuration  phase. We hypothesized that a pulse exposure to fipronil during critical periods  of central nervous system development would adversely affect fish later in life.  After a 48 hour pulse exposure, survival was reduced in embryos exposed to 2 μg  fipronil/L or greater. However, there was no further mortality during the  depuration phase, nor were there changes in body length nor notochord length in  larvae 9 dpf (days post-fertilization) compared to controls. Additional  experiments were carried out at higher concentrations over 96 h (up to 4 dpf) to  also elucidate developmental effects and teratogenicity of fipronil (43.7 μg/L up  to 4370 μg/L). Fipronil at these higher concentrations significantly impacted the  development of zebrafish, and the following morphometric and teratogenic effects  were observed in 4 dpf fish; reduced body length, yolk sac and pericardial edema,  reduced midbrain length, reduced optic and otic diameter, and truncation of the  lower jaw. In depurated fish, we hypothesized that there would exist residual  effects of exposure at the molecular level. Transcriptome profiling was therefore  conducted on 9 dpf depurated larvae exposed initially for 48 h to one dose of  either 0.2 μg/L, 200 μg/L or 2000 μg/L fipronil. The expression of gene networks  associated with glycogen and omega-3-fatty acid metabolism were decreased in  larvae exposed to each of the three concentrations of fipronil, suggesting  metabolic disruption. Moreover, transcriptomics revealed that fipronil suppressed  gene networks related to light-dark adaptation, photoperiod sensing, and  circadian rhythm. Based on these data, we tested fish for altered behavioral  responses in a Light-Dark preference test. Larvae exposed to {\textgreater}200 μg fipronil/L  as embryos showed fewer number of visits (20-30\% less) to the dark zone compared  to controls. Larvae also spent a lower amount of time in the dark zone compared  to controls, suggesting that fipronil strengthened dark avoidance behavior which  is indicative of anxiety. This study demonstrates that a short pulse exposure to  fipronil can affect transcriptome networks for metabolism, circadian rhythm, and  response to light in fish after depuration, and these molecular responses are  hypothesized to be related to aberrant behavioral effects observed in the  light-dark preference test.},

	abstract = {Recent studies indicated that 'inert ingredients' exert negative effects on the environment. Herbicide safeners are classed as 'inert ingredients', which  increase the selectivity and detoxification of herbicides. However, little  attention has been focused on the environmental behavior of herbicide safeners.  AD-67 (AD), fenclorim (FM), and flurazole (FZ) are three commercially available  herbicide safeners. In this study, zebrafish embryos were used as a model to  investigate the potential developmental toxicity of these three safeners. The  results showed that AD, FM, and FZ 96 h-LC(50) values were 2.52, 1.26, and  2.01 mg/L, respectively. Significant decreased body lengths were observed in  embryos after 96 h of exposure to 0.2 mg/L FM and FZ. Hatching rates  significantly increased at 24 h and decreased at 96 h in all treatment groups  (0.02 mg/L AD, 0.2 mg/L AD, 0.02 mg/L AD, 0.2 mg/L FZ, as well as 0.01 and  0.1 mg/L FM). No significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) changes in heartbeat numbers (60 s), but  clearly increased malformation rates were observed in response to safeners  exposure. Furthermore, embryos showed signs of oxidative stress, such as  decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, altered activities of glutathione  reductase and catalase and cell apoptosis. The gene transcription related to body  malformation (egf, krt 17, and tbx 16) and cell apoptosis (bcl 2 and bax) changed  in treated groups. These genes have been connected to potential toxicological  mechanisms. These results indicate that the herbicide safeners AD, FM, and FZ  induced developmental toxicities in zebrafish embryos. This study is the first  report of the toxicity of safeners in the development of zebrafish embryos. The  results may be useful for assessing the risk of herbicides safeners in the  aquatic ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Triazole fungicides are increasingly used in North America to combat mold and fungi, in order to protect vegetables, citrus, ornamental plants and field crops.  To determine the biological impacts of tebuconazole in non-target aquatic  organisms, early life stage zebrafish were exposed to 0.1-100 μM tebuconazole for  120 h (5 dpf). There was a significant increase in mortality over time and at  100 μM, only 50\% of the animals survived 96 h compared to {\textgreater}95\% for all other  experimental groups. There was evidence for increased hatching time with 10 μM  tebuconazole compared to the control group ({\textasciitilde}7 h longer at 50\% total hatch) or a  lack of hatch observed with 100 μM. Oxidative respiration and behavior were  evaluated to assess whether the fungicide impaired energy-associated processes.  Oxygen consumption rates in embryos (exposed from {\textasciitilde}6 hpf) were determined with  exposure to 2.5, 25, 50, 100 μM tebuconazole for 24 h using the XFe24  Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Embryos treated with 100 μM showed a {\textasciitilde}60\% reduction  in basal respiration, indicating impaired oxygen consumption and/or changes in  resource allocation (e.g. anti-oxidant production, metabolite synthesis).  Environmentally-relevant concentrations of tebuconazole did not affect oxidative  phosphorylation. As behavior is a sensitive endpoint for toxicity, we measured  the dark photokinesis response and conducted a light-dark preference test in  6 dpf larvae following a sub-chronic exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 μM tebuconazole  beginning with 6 hpf embryos. It was observed in two independent experiments for  dark photokinesis that 10 μM tebuconazole reduced total distance moved (i.e.  hypoactivity) in the dark period by {\textasciitilde}25-35\%. In the light-dark preference test,  there was an increase for mean time in dark zone ({\textasciitilde}100\% increase in the average  time/visits per second) and frequency in dark zone (increase of {\textasciitilde}35\% in average  number of visits) with tebuconazole, suggestive of anxiolytic behavior at  environmentally-relevant doses. This study demonstrates that exposure to  tebuconazole can affect survival, hatch time, oxidative phosphorylation, and  behavioral activity of early-staged zebrafish. While survival, hatch time, and  mitochondrial bioenergetics were not different than control fish at  environmentally-relevant levels of tebuconazole, behavioral responses were  detected at concentrations reported in some aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Paraquat (PQ) is a pesticide highly toxic to human beings, and a well-known trigger of oxidative stress. Although several animal models of PQ poisoning have  been developed, some disadvantages limit their application in vivo. A zebrafish  model was used in the present study to better define mechanisms of oxidative  stress injury induced by PQ. MAIN METHODS: The toxicity of PQ was evaluated in  the AB strain of zebrafish, and apoptosis was assessed by acridine orange  staining. Macrophage migration was identified using the TG (zlyz:EGFP) transgenic  strain, and angiogenesis was observed using the fli1a-EGFP casper strain.  Following the validation of gene changes by zebrafish-based in vivo quantitative  real-time PCR, network analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway  Analysis software. KEY FINDINGS: We first established the LC50 of PQ in the  zebrafish model, and then found that robust oxidative stress and antioxidant  genes were activated after PQ exposure. Moreover, apoptosis and distinct  macrophage activation and migration were identified for the first time in  PQ-exposed zebrafish. Utilizing this model, both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways  involved in PQ-induced apoptosis were elucidated. We further demonstrated that  macrophage migration was specifically induced by PQ, and that Rho family members  and JNK-MMP13 signaling participated in this process. SIGNIFICANCE: Zebrafish is  a promising tool for investigating the mechanisms of oxidative stress injury  induced by PQ, and for screening effective anti-oxidant drugs.},

	abstract = {Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) belong to the family of pattern recognition receptor, represent the major constituent of innate immunity.  Although PGRPs are structurally conserved through evolution, their involvement in  innate immunity is different in vertebrates and invertebrates. They are highly  specific towards recognition of ligands and can hydrolyze bacterial  peptidoglycans (PGNs). Zebrafish PGRPs (zPGRPs) have both peptidoglycans lytic  amidase activity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity, but far less is known  about how these receptors recognize these microbial ligands. Such studies are  hindered due to lack of structural and functional configuration of zPGRPs.  Therefore, in this study, we predicted the three-dimensional structure of zPGRP2  through theoretical modeling, investigated the conformational and dynamic  properties through molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular docking study  revealed the microbial ligands, that is, muramyl pentapeptide-DAP , muramyl  pentapeptide-LYS, muramyl tripeptide-DAP, muramyl tripeptide-Lys, muramyl  tetrapeptide-DAP, muramyl tetrapeptide-LYS and tracheal cytotoxin interacts with  the conserved amino acids of the ligand recognition site comprised of β1, α2, α4,  β4 and loops connecting β1 - α2, α2 - β2, β3 - β4 and α4 - α5. Conserved His31,  His32, Ala34, Ile35, Pro36, Lys38, Asp60, Trp61, Trp63, Ala89, His90, Asp106,  His143 and Arg144 are predicted to essential for binding and provides stability  to these zPGRP-PGN complexes. Our study provides basic molecular information for  further research on the immune mechanisms of PGRP's in Zebrafish. The plasticity  of the zPGRP's binding site revealed by these microbial ligands suggests an  intrinsic capacity of the innate immune system to rapidly evolve specificities to  meet new microbial challenges in the future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this study, the α1 subunit, the β2S subunit lacking 47 amino acid  residues compared with the β2L subunit, and the γ2 subunit having five  transmembrane domains were isolated from zebrafish Danio rerio. The responses of  homomeric and heteromeric (α1, β2S and γ2) channels to agonists and  GABA(A)R-targeted compounds were detected with two-electrode voltage clamp.  Dose-dependent responses were observed in heteromeric α1β2S, β2Sγ2, and α1β2Sγ2  GABAR channels with EC(50) values at 21.75, 6291, and 33.69 μM for GABA-induced  current and 3.28, 155.5, and 3.79 mM for β-alanine-induced current, respectively.  However, no response was induced by benzamidine in all GABAR channels. Abamectin,  dieldrin, fluralaner and fipronil could strongly inhibited GABA-induced inward  current ≥50\% at 10(-6) M, while α-endosulfan, flufiprole and ethiprole only  inhibited GABA-induced current {\textless}50\%.

	abstract = {Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease is a heterogeneous and highly morbid group of energy deficiency disorders for which no proven effective therapies  exist. Robust vertebrate animal models of primary RC dysfunction are needed to  explore the effects of variation in RC disease subtypes, tissue-specific  manifestations, and major pathogenic factors contributing to each disorder, as  well as their pre-clinical response to therapeutic candidates. We have developed  a series of zebrafish (Danio rerio) models that inhibit, to variable degrees,  distinct aspects of RC function, and enable quantification of animal development,  survival, behaviors, and organ-level treatment effects as well as effects on  mitochondrial biochemistry and physiology. Here, we characterize four  pharmacologic inhibitor models of mitochondrial RC dysfunction in early larval  zebrafish, including rotenone (complex I inhibitor), azide (complex IV  inhibitor), oligomycin (complex V inhibitor), and chloramphenicol (mitochondrial  translation inhibitor that leads to multiple RC complex dysfunction). A range of  concentrations and exposure times of each RC inhibitor were systematically  evaluated on early larval development, animal survival, integrated behaviors  (touch and startle responses), organ physiology (brain death, neurologic tone,  heart rate), and fluorescence-based analyses of mitochondrial physiology in  zebrafish skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic RC inhibitor effects were validated by  spectrophotometric analysis of Complex I, II and IV enzyme activities, or  relative quantitation of ATP levels in larvae. Outcomes were prioritized that  utilize in vivo animal imaging and quantitative behavioral assessments, as may  optimally inform the translational potential of pre-clinical drug screens for  future clinical study in human mitochondrial disease subjects. The RC complex  inhibitors each delayed early embryo development, with short-term exposures of  these three agents or chloramphenicol from 5 to 7 days post fertilization also  causing reduced larval survival and organ-specific defects ranging from brain  death, behavioral and neurologic alterations, reduced mitochondrial membrane  potential in skeletal muscle (rotenone), and/or cardiac edema with visible blood  pooling (oligomycin). Remarkably, we demonstrate that treating animals with  probucol, a nutrient-sensing signaling network modulating drug that has been  shown to yield therapeutic effects in a range of other RC disease cellular and  animal models, both prevented acute rotenone-induced brain death in zebrafish  larvae, and significantly rescued early embryo developmental delay from either  rotenone or oligomycin exposure. Overall, these zebrafish pharmacologic RC  function inhibition models offer a unique opportunity to gain novel insights into  diverse developmental, survival, organ-level, and behavioral defects of varying  severity, as well as their individual response to candidate therapies, in a  highly tractable and cost-effective vertebrate animal model system.},

Neurobehavioral effects on larval fish are  known to occur at concentrations higher than those reported in the environment.  The aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of neurobehavioral,  molecular, and biochemical responses of four OPs (diazinon, dichlorvos,  malathion, methyl-parathion) via the following endpoint measurements: distance  traveled, velocity, gene expression (AChE, c-Fos, LINGO-1B, GRIN-1B), enzymatic  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and carboxylesterase (CES) activity. OP  exposures (5 hpf - 120 dpf) on embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) were  assessed using a larval zebrafish behavior assay at concentrations: 0.01, 0.1,  10, and 100 μg/L. Individual OPs had varying degrees of neurotoxicity.  Significant hypoactivity was observed in the 100 μg/L treatments for diazinon and  malathion (p {\textless} 0.05) as compared to the controls. Diazinon-exposed larvae  exhibited a 26\% locomotor decrease, and hypoactivity was observed in  malathion-exposed larvae at a reduction of 22\% and 29\% for distance traveled and  velocity, respectively. Gene regulation and enzymatic activity changes were  measured for both 0.1 and 100 μg/L exposures across OP treatments. Increased CES  activity was observed for the 0.1 μg/L treatments of diazinon and  methyl-parathion as well as the 100 μg/L treatment of dichlorvos; meanwhile,  decreased CES activity was observed for 100 μg/L treatments of diazinon and  malathion. Relative enzymatic activity of AChE was inhibited as compared to the  control for the 0.1 μg/L diazinon. No other treatment group exhibited a  significant effect on biochemical AChE activity; however, AChE upregulation was  observed in the 0.1 μg/L exposure for diazinon, dichlorvos, and malathion.  Methyl-parathion was observed to downregulate c-Fos at 0.1 μg/L exposure.  Malathion upregulated LINGO-1B at 100 μg/L, a gene associated with neuronal  regeneration; meanwhile, downregulation of LINGO-1B was observed for 0.1 μg/L  exposure of methyl-parathion. Additional downregulation was observed for GRIN-1B  in the 100 μg/L diazinon, 100 μg/L dichlorvos, and 0.1 μg/L methyl-parathion  treatments. Exposure of ZF embryos to independent concentrations of 100 μg/L  concentrations of diazinon and malathion resulted in hypoactivity and decreased  CES activity at 5 dfp. No changes in swimming behavior were observed for either  the 0.1 μg/L or 100 μg/L dichlorvos or methyl-parathion treatments. Observations  from this study indicate that AChE inhibition may not be the most sensitive  biomarker of OP pesticide exposure in zebrafish. Rather, the enzyme CES  demonstrated higher sensitivity as a biomarker of OP toxicity.},

An avoidance assay system was used with a  contamination gradient formed by seven compartments, through which the fish could  move and choose the preferred compartment(s). Additionally, the influence of fish  movements in promoting the mixing between compartments and thus disruption of the  gradient over time was also examined by testing sodium chloride (NaCl) at  sublethal concentrations. Samples with pyrimethanil were obtained from the  commercial formulation Mythos®, which was applied to mesocosm systems. Samples of  the pyrimethanil-contaminated mesocosms water were collected and a series of  seven concentrations (0.2 to 1.4mgL(-1) plus a control) diluted with reference  (uncontaminated) mesocosm water were added to the system to form the gradient.  After 4h exposure, fish avoidance in the three highest pyrimethanil  concentrations ranged from 29 to 66\%. The 4h-AC50 (concentration at which 50\% of  the fish avoided pyrimethanil after 4h exposure) was 1.10 (confidence interval:  1.07 to 1.12)mgL(-1). However, the avoidance pattern after 12h was strongly  reduced and it was not possible to calculate the AC50. This is explained by the  results of the NaCl experiment, which showed that the movement of fish in the  system accelerates the mixing of the solutions between compartments. As  pyrimethanil can trigger avoidance response in D. rerio, this fungicide, even at  non-lethal concentrations, could be considered an environmental disturber.},

However, researches about the  combined effects of MPs and pesticides are very limited. A simple combined  exposure model was established in this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to  100 μg/L imidacloprid (IMI), 20 μg/L polystyrene microplastics (PS), and a  combination of PS and IMI (PS + IMI) for 21 days. The results demonstrated that  exposure to PS and IMI inhibited the growth of zebrafish and altered the levels  of glycolipid metabolism and oxidative stress-related biochemical parameters.  While gene expression analysis revealed that, compared with PS or IMI treatment  group, combined exposure caused a greater change in gene expression levels  involving the process of glycolipid metabolism (Gk, Hk1, Aco, PPar-α, Cpt1, Acc,  Fas, PPar-γ, Apo) and inflammatory response (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-10).  The results demonstrated that even combined exposure of low concentrations of PS  and IMI could cause more severe hepatotoxicity in zebrafish, especially in terms  of gene transcription. And more combined toxicity studies are essential for MPs  and pesticides risk assessment.},

However, their  non-target toxicity and environmental behavior with respect to enantioselectivity  have received limited attention. In the present study, tebuconazole and  myclobutanil enantiomers were isolated and used to evaluate the occurrence of  enantioselectivity in their acute toxicity to three non-target organisms  (Scenedesmus obliquus, Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio). Significant differences  were found: R-(-)-tebuconazole was about 1.4-5.9 times more toxic than  S-(+)-tebuconazole; rac-myclobutanil was about 1.3-6.1 and 1.4-7.3 more toxic  than (-)-myclobutanil and (+)-myclobutanil, respectively. Enantioselectivity was  further investigated in terms of fungicide degradation in seven soil samples,  which were selected to cover a broad range of soil properties. In aerobic or  anaerobic soils, the S-(+)-tebuconazole degraded faster than R-(-)-tebuconazole,  and the enantioselectivity showed a correlation with soil organic carbon content.  (+)-Myclobutanil was preferentially degraded than (-)-myclobutanil in aerobic  soils, whereas both enantiomers degraded at similar rates in anaerobic soils.  Apparent correlations of enantioselectivity with soil pH and soil texture were  observed for myclobutanil under aerobic conditions. In addition, both fungicides  were configurationally stable in soils, i.e., no enantiomerization was found.  Enantioselectivity may be a common phenomenon in both aquatic toxicity and  biodegradation of chiral triazole fungicides, and this should be considered when  assessing ecotoxicological risks of these compounds in the environment.},

In this study, broflanilide showed low toxicity to the  zebrafish, Danio rerio, with LC(50) {\textgreater} 10 mg L(-1) at 96 h and also did not  inhibit GABA-induced currents of the heteromeric Drα1β2Sγ2 GABA receptor.  Broflanilide showed medium bioconcentration level with a bioconcentration factor  at steady state (BCF(ss)) of 10.02 and 69.40 in D. rerio at 2.00 mg L(-1) and  0.20 mg L(-1), respectively. In the elimination process, the concentration of  broflanilide rapidly decreased within two days and slowly dropped below the limit  of quantification after ten days. In the 2.00 mg L(-1) broflanilide treatment,  CYP450 activity was significantly increased up to 3.11-fold during eight days.  Glutathione-S- transferase (GST) activity significantly increased by 91.44 \%  within four days. In conclusion, the acute toxicity of broflanilide was low, but  it might induce chronic toxicity, affecting metabolism. To our knowledge, this is  the first report of the toxicological effects of broflanilide on an aquatic  organism, which has the potential to guide the use of broflanilide in the field.},

Compared with control fish, rotenone-treated fish spent less time  swimming at a fast speed, indicating a deficit in motor function. In the  light-dark box test, rotenone-treated fish exhibited longer latencies to enter  the dark compartment and spent more time in the light compartment, reflecting  anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Furthermore, rotenone-treated fish showed  less of an olfactory preference for amino acid, indicating olfactory dysfunction.  These behavioral symptoms were associated with decreased levels of dopamine in  the brains of rotenone-treated fish.

The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of PPF on  reproductive endocrine system of male and female zebrafish along  hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In brain, PPF caused significant  alteration in the transcripts of erα, lhβ, and cyp19b genes in male and fshβ,  lhβ, and cyp19b genes in female zebrafish. The downstream genes of steroidogenic  pathway like, star, 3βhsd, 17βhsd, and cyp19a expression were significantly  altered in gonad of both sexes. Subsequent changes in circulatory steroid hormone  levels lead to imbalance in hormone homeostasis as revealed from  estradiol/testosterone (E(2)/T) ratio. Further, the vitellogenin transcript level  was enhanced in hepatic tissues and their blood plasma content was increased in  male (16.21\%) and declined in female (21.69\%). PPF also induced histopathological  changes in gonads such as, reduction of mature spermatocytes in male and  vitellogenic oocytes in female zebrafish. The altered E(2)/T ratio and gonadal  histopathology were supported by the altered transcript levels of HPG axis genes.  Overall, these findings provide new insights of PPF in zebrafish reproductive  system and highlights for further investigations on its potential risks in  aquatic environment.},

Embryos were dechorionated and  waterborne exposed to the endosulfan I or endosulfan sulfate from 6 to 120h  post-fertilization (hpf). Endosulfan I exposure concentrations ranged from 0.01  to 10microg/L and endosulfan sulfate from 1 to 100microg/L. Water solutions were  renewed every 24h and fish were scored for overt developmental and behavioral  abnormalities. Chemical analysis was performed on water, whole embryo, and larvae  samples to determine waterborne exposure concentrations and tissue concentrations  throughout the 5-day period. The most sensitive toxicity endpoint for both  endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate was an abnormal response of the embryo/larvae  to touch, suggesting that endosulfan I and sulfate are developmentally  neurotoxic. The waterborne exposure EC(50)s for inhibition of touch response for  endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate were 2.2microg/L and 23microg/L,  respectively. The endosulfans were highly concentrated by the organisms, and the  inhibition of touch response tissue EC(50), determined from the measured tissue  concentrations, was 367ng/g for endosulfan I and 4552ng/g for endosulfan sulfate.},

RNA-seq  revealed that the pathways related to cell apoptosis and cancer, and cellular  components organelle membrane and mitochondrion, were markedly affected after TR,  KM, AZ and PY exposure during zebrafish early life stages. The results were  further confirmed by the induction of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and  superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, the elevation of H(2)O(2), malondialdehyde  (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, as well as the reduction of  intracellular calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP),  which indicated that strobilurins could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell  apoptosis.

However, there is still limited observation and  understanding of the potential of chemicals to influence life outcomes over  several generations. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two  environmental contaminants, coumarin 47 and permethrin, on exposed zebrafish (F0)  and their progeny (F1-F3). Coumarin 47 is commonly found in personal care  products and dyes, whereas permethrin is used as a domestic and agricultural  pyrethroid insecticide/insect repellent. Zebrafish (F0) were exposed during early  development until 28 days post-fertilization and their progeny (F1-F3) were bred  unexposed. On one hand, the effects induced by coumarin 47 suggest no  multigenerational toxicity. On the other hand, we found that behavior of  zebrafish larvae was significantly affected by exposure to permethrin in F1 to F3  generations with some differences depending on the concentration. This suggests  persistent alteration of the neural or neuromuscular function. In addition,  lipidomic analyses showed that permethrin treatment was partially correlated with  lysophosphatidylcholine levels in zebrafish, an important lipid for  neurodevelopment. Overall, these results stress out one of the most widely used  pyrethroids can trigger long-term, multi- and possibly transgenerational changes  in the nervous system of zebrafish. These neurobehavioral changes echo the  effects observed under direct exposure to high concentrations of permethrin and  therefore call for more research on mechanisms underlying effect inheritance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: FireMaster® 550 (FM 550) is the second most commonly used flame retardant (FR) product in consumer goods and has been detected in household dust  samples. However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been  characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in  zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of  FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550  exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well  as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied.  In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during  adolescence in zebrafish were studied. METHODS: Developmental exposure to 0,  0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization,  with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute  adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion,  for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank  water with .0004\% (developmental) or .0012\% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior  was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation,  sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration.  RESULTS: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a  significant (p{\textless}0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM  550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior  (p's{\textless}0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were  attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point DISCUSSION: Taken together,  these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations  to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains  and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute  adolescent exposure.},

	abstract = {Synthetic organic insecticides, including pyrethroids, organophosphates, neonicotinoids and other types, have the potential to alter the ecosystems and  many are harmful to humans. This study examines the developmental toxicity and  neurotoxicity of three synthetic organic insecticides, including deltamethrin  (DM), acephate (AP), and thiamethoxam (TM), using embryo-larval stages of  zebrafish (Danio rerio). Results showed that DM exposure led to embryo  development delay and a significant increase in embryo mortality at 24 and 48 h  post-fertilization (hpf). DM and AP decreased embryo chorion surface tension at  24 hpf, along with the increase in hatching rate at 72 hpf. Moreover, DM caused  ntl, shh, and krox20 misexpression in a dose-dependent manner with morphological  deformities of shorter body length, smaller eyes, and larger head-body angles at  10 μg/L. TM did not show significant developmental toxicity. Furthermore, results  of larval rest/wake assay indicated that DM ({\textgreater}0.1 μg/L) and AP (0.1 mg/L)  increased activity behavior with different patterns. Interestingly, as an  insect-specific pesticide, TM still could alter locomotor activity in zebrafish  larvae at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L. Our results indicate that different  types of synthetic organic insecticides could create different toxicity outcomes  in zebrafish embryos and larvae.},

	abstract = {Broad applications and exposure to the fungicide maneb can lead to toxicity in non-target organisms. Maneb is also associated with neurogenerative diseases such  as Parkinson's disease (PD). The objectives of this study were to determine the  acute toxicity of maneb to zebrafish by measuring mitochondrial bioenergetics,  locomotor activity, and the expression of genes related to the oxidative damage  response, as well as those related to dopamine signaling due to its association  with PD. Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either  solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 µM maneb  for 96 h. Maneb was moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos, and had a 96-h LC(50)  value of 4.29 μM ({\textasciitilde} 1.14 mg/L). Maneb induced a dose-dependent increase in  mortality, decreased hatching rate, and increased notochord deformity rate at  both 1.0 and 10.0 µM after 72 and 96 h. Total body length was also significantly  reduced with 1.0 µM maneb. A 50-60\% decrease in mean basal oxygen consumption  rate was also observed in embryos following a 24 hpf exposure to 10.0 µM maneb  but oligomycin-induced ATP production and FCCP-induced maximum respiration  remained unaffected. No change was detected in the expression levels of genes  associated with oxidative stress (sod1 and sod2), nor those related to dopamine  synthesis (th1), dopamine transporter (dat), dopamine receptors (drd1, drd2a,  drd3, and drd4b). Thus, modifying the expression of these transcripts may not be  a mechanism for maneb-induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish. To assess the  potential for neurotoxicity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae  following 7 d exposure to 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM maneb. Larvae exposed to 0.5 and  1.0 μM maneb showed signs related to hypoactivity, and this reduced activity is  hypothesized to be associated with notochord defects as this deformity was  prevalent at higher concentrations of maneb. Overall, these data demonstrate that  maneb negatively affects embryonic development (i.e. notochord development),  affects basal oxygen consumption rates of embryos, and induces hypoactivity in  larval fish. This study improves understanding regarding the developmental  neurotoxicity of the fungicide maneb to zebrafish.},

	abstract = {When the amount of pesticide exceeds the self-purification ability of the environment, it will be enriched in the human body through the atmosphere, soil,  water circulation, etc., threatening human health. Aryloxy-phenoxy-propionate  (APP) herbicides are a class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor  herbicides, widely used in field-weeding of soybean, cabbage, peanut and other  crops. However, due to the water circulation, surface runoff and the agronomic  practices such as watering irrigation, APP herbicides have the risk of polluting  water and destroying the living environment of aquatic organisms. In this paper,  a multistep framework combining homology modeling, molecular docking and  molecular dynamic simulations were adopted to explore the interactions between  APP herbicides and zebrafish estrogen receptor α (ERα) to investigate the  estrogenic activities of the herbicides. The structure of zebrafish ERα was  modeled by homology modeling, using the human's estrogen receptor α (PDB ID:2YJA)  as the template. Then, eight typical APP herbicides were selected to dock with  the zebrafish ERα, and it was determined that there were clear interactions  between the herbicides and the receptor. The binding patterns of  Quizalofop-P-ethyl (QPE), Clodinafop-propargyl (CP) and Haloxyfop-P (HP) with ERα  were further investigated by molecular dynamics and binding free energy  calculation. The results showed the van der Waals force and electrostatic force  were the main driving forces for maintaining the stability of the complex system.  In order to verify the theoretical prediction, an exposed experiment was  conducted to study the effects of different concentrations of herbicides on VTG  level of zebrafish in vivo and the results were consistent with the computational  method. The results of this study revealed the mechanism of the action between  APP herbicides and zebrafish estrogen receptors, and also provided ideas for  optimizing the herbicides.},

	abstract = {Triadimefon (TDF) is a pesticide used in agricultural crops to control powdery mildews, rusts and other fungal pests. It exerts its fungicidal activity through  the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, impairing the formation of the cell  membrane. For vertebrates, one of its side effects is the binding to the dopamine  transporter increasing the levels of synaptic dopamine, similarly to cocaine. In  addition, it has been demonstrated that TDF affects the abundance of other  monoamines in the brain, specifically serotonin. It is well known that drugs  which alter the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems produce behavioral changes  and participate in the development of addictions in mammals. In this work we have  used the conditioned place preference paradigm to assess, for the first time, the  rewarding properties of TDF in zebrafish. We found out that TDF triggers both,  preference and aversion depending on the dosage used during conditioning. We  observed that 5 mg/L produced aversion to the pattern previously paired with TDF.  However, 15 mg/L induced the opposite behavior, showing that zebrafish seek out  those environments which had previously been paired with the higher dose of TDF.  These results are congruent with our previous findings, where we showed that  5 mg/L reduced the levels of serotonin, usually linked to anxious behaviors (a  negative cue), whereas higher concentrations of TDF increased extracellular  dopamine, the main currency of the reward system. Interestingly, both doses of  TDF induced circling behavior, a feature usually seen in glutamatergic  antagonists.},

In the present study,  we explored the potential endocrine-disrupting risk of β-endosulfan by  investigating its effect on the growth, reproduction, plasma vitellogenin, and  organ histology of adult zebrafish. We found that, although β-endosulfan did not  significantly affect the growth of zebrafish, it greatly decreased the hatching  rate, even at a concentration as low as 10 ng/L. Interestingly, the decrease of  the hatching rate was highly correlated with pathological alterations of the  testes. Additionally, the values of the gonadosomatic index were significantly  reduced in female zebrafish treated with 200 ng/L β-endosulfan, which was also  closely associated with ovarian histological changes. More importantly, a  significant increase in the level of vitellogenin was observed in all male fish  treated with β-endosulfan. Based on these findings, we conclude that β-endosulfan  severely affects the reproductive function of zebrafish and the synthesis of  vitellogenin in the liver, and thus, β-endosulfan has a serious endocrine  disruption function in zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological indications connect maternal and developmental presence or exposure to pesticides with an increased risk for a spectrum of neurological  trajectories. To provide pre-clinical data in support of this hypothesis, we used  two distinct experimental models. First, female and male mice were fed  immediately prior to mating, and the resulting pregnant dams were continously fed  during gestation and lactation periods using chow pellets containing a cocktail  of six pesticides at tolerable daily intake levels. Male and female offspring  were then tracked for behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological adaptations.  Second, a zebrafish model allowed us to screen toxicity and motor-behavior  outcomes specifically associated with the developmental exposure to a low-to-high  concentration range of the cocktail and of each individual pesticide. Here, we  report anxiety-like behavior in aging male mice maternally exposed to the  cocktail, as compared to age and gender matched sham animals. In parallel,  in vivo electrocorticography revealed a decrease in gamma (40-80 Hz) and an  increase of theta (6-9 Hz) waves, delineating a long-term, age-dependent,  neuronal slowing. Neurological changes were not accompanied by brain structural  malformations. Next, by using zebrafish larvae, we showed an increase of all  motor-behavioral parameters resulting from the developmental exposure to 10 μg/L  of pesticide cocktail, an outcome that was not associated with midbrain  structural or neurovascular modifications as assessed by in vivo 2-photon  microscopy. When screening each pesticide, chlorpyrifos elicited modifications of  swimming parameters at 0.1 μg/L, while other components provoked changes from  0.5 μg/L. Ziram was the single most toxic component inducing developmental  malformations and mortality at 10 μg/L. Although we have employed non-equivalent  modalities and timing of exposure in two dissimilar experimental models, these  outcomes indicate that presence of a pesticide cocktail during perinatal periods  represents an element promoting behavioral and neurophysiological modifications.  The study limitations and the possible pertinence of our findings to  ecotoxicology and public health are critically discussed.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system (CNS)  following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. Zebrafish were fed  pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8μg/g dieldrin for 21days. Behavioral  analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to  anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were  decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,  consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes  related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by  dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap  identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These  proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated  protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal  recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were  functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis  implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases  associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial  dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association  between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic  and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative  diseases. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine  pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as  Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for  human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed  to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are  altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and  protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's  disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight  into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the  association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration.  These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework  for pesticide induced neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Paraquat is a polar herbicide protecting plant products against invasive species, it requires careful manipulation and restricted usage because of its harmful  potentials. Exposure to paraquat triggers oxidative damage in dopaminergic  neurons and subsequently causes a behavioral defect in vivo. Thereby, persistent  exposure to paraquat is known to increase Parkinson's disease risk by  dysregulating dopaminergic systems in humans. Therefore, most studies have  focused on the dopaminergic systems to elucidate the neurotoxicological mechanism  of paraquat poisoning, and more comprehensive neurochemistry including  histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems has remained  unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the toxicological potential of  paraquat poisoning using a variety of approaches such as toxicokinetic profiles,  behavioral effects, neural activity, and broad-spectrum neurochemistry in  zebrafish larvae after short-term exposure to paraquat and we performed the  molecular modeling approach. Our results showed that paraquat was slowly absorbed  in the brain of zebrafish after oral administration of paraquat. In addition,  paraquat toxicity resulted in behavioral impairments, namely, reduced motor  activity and led to abnormal neural activities in zebrafish larvae. This  locomotor deficit came with a dysregulation of dopamine synthesis induced by the  inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, which was also indirectly confirmed  by molecular modeling studies. Furthermore, short-term exposure to paraquat also  caused simultaneous dysregulation of other neurochemistry including cholinergic  and serotonergic systems in zebrafish larvae. The present study suggests that  this neurotoxicological profiling could be a useful tool for understanding the  brain neurochemistry of neurotoxic agents that might be a potential risk to human  and environmental health.},

	abstract = {Fish are warned about the presence of predators via an alarm cue released from the skin of injured conspecifics. The detection of this odor inherently initiates  an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the  individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used  pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we  analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract  following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate  that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos  significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an  impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the  pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be  detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner  to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors  such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity.  Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a  choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to  chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the  olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing  that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.},

	abstract = {The available arable land is unable to fulfill the food production need of rapidly the exponentially growing human population in the world. Pesticides are  one of those different measures taken to meet this demand. As a plant growth  regulator to block gibberellin, paclobutrazol (PBZ) is used excessively  throughout the world to promote early fruit setting, and to increase seed setting  which might be harmful because PBZ is a very stable compound; therefore, it can  bioaccumulate into the food chain of an ecosystem. In the present study, we  discovered unexpected effects of PBZ on zebrafish larvae and adult behaviors by  challenging them with low dose exposure. Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days  post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 µg/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 µg/L  (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 µg/L (0.1 ppm)  and 1000 µg/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days.  After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the  larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror  biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish  were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to  biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide  dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ  exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming  pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior,  while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and  predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly  compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays  for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed  significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first  time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral  alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used  plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough  tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.},

Current study was designed to investigate the  toxic effect of TAP at different doses (0.06, 0.3 and 1.5 mg/L) to the model  organism of zebrafish (Danio rerio) by using multi-endpoint analysis in a 96 h  acute exposure test. The direct observation that histological and ultrastructural  alteration of zebrafish brain and liver were carried out via paraffin section in  hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),  respectively. In addition, a series of methods were applied for exploring the  physiological parameters related to cellular apoptosis. Results indicated that  vacuolar structure after 96 h treatment with TAP were appeared in the molecular  and granular layers of cerebellum. A large number of nuclear retraction, tissues  vacuolation and cytoplasmic loss were observed in liver at histological level.  From the fine structural level, the mitochondrial vacuolation and membrane damage  of brain cells were found and the cristae of mitochondria disintegrated partly in  hepatocytes. Onset of such histological structure alterations were one of the  most intuitive reflection to TAP exposure, which needs to analyze biochemical  alterations for further study. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) showed  a downward trend in the brain and liver of zebrafish. Simultaneously, the  activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased after 96 h exposure with a  concentration-dependent manner, which could be served as a suitable indicator of  cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis-related genes (Apaf-1, p53, Bax,  Bcl-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9) transcription showed different alterations in  response to the TAP treatment. These results indicated that TAP exposure led to  apoptosis in zebrafish brain and liver and it was speculated that the apoptosis  may occur through mitochondrial pathway. The present study demonstrated that the  exposure of zebrafish to the insecticide TAP led to observe its effects at both  histological structure and apoptosis level in liver and brain.},

Unfortunately, standardized approaches, including HTS experimental  designs, for examining fish behavioral responses to contaminants are rarely  available. In the present study, we examined movement behavior of larval  zebrafish over 7 days (4-10 days post fertilization or dpf) during typical  daylight workday hours to determine whether intrinsic activity differed with age  and time of day. We then employed an early life stage approach using the Fish  Embryo Test (FET) at multiple developmental ages to evaluate whether photomotor  response (PMR) behavior differed with zebrafish age following exposure to  diazinon (DZN), a well-studied orthophosphate insecticide, and diphenhydramine  (DPH), an antihistamine that also targets serotonin reuptake transporters and the  acetylcholine receptor. 72h studies were conducted at 1-4, 4-7 and 7-10dpf,  followed by behavioral observations using a ViewPoint system at 4, 7 and 10dpf.  Distance traveled and swimming speeds were quantified; nominal treatment levels  were analytically verified by isotope-dilution LC-MSMS. Larval zebrafish  locomotion displayed significantly different (p{\textless}0.05) activity profiles over the  course of typical daylight and workday hours, and these time of day PMR activity  profiles were similar across ages examined (4-10dpf). 10dpf zebrafish larvae were  consistently more sensitive to DPH than either the 4 or 7dpf larvae with an  environmentally realistic lowest observed effect concentration of 200ng/L. Though  ELS and FET studies with zebrafish typically focus on mortality or teratogenicity  in 0-4dpf organisms, behavioral responses of slightly older fish were several  orders of magnitude more sensitive to DPH. Our observations highlight the  importance of understanding the influence of time of day on intrinsic locomotor  activity, and the age-specific hazards of aquatic contaminants to fish behavior.},

The ubiquitous use of glyphosate has drawn  extensive attention to its toxicity as an organic pollutant. In this study, we  employed larval zebrafish as an animal model to evaluate the effect of different  concentrations of glyphosate on early development via morphological,  biomechanics, behavioral and physiological analyses. Morphological results showed  that an obvious delay occurred in the epiboly process and body length, eye and  head area were reduced at concentrations higher than 10 mg/L. The expression of  ntl (no tail) shortened and krox20 (also known as Egr2b, early growth response  2b) changed as the glyphosate concentration increased, but there was no change in  the expression of shh (sonic hedgehog). In addition, biomechanical analysis of  the elasticity of chorion indicated that treated embryos' surface tension was  declined. Furthermore, a 48-h locomotion test revealed that embryonic exposure to  glyphosate significantly elevated locomotor activities, which is probably  attributed to motoneuronal damage. The decreased surface tension of chorion and  the increased locomotive activities may contribute to the hatching rates after  glyphosate treatment. Our study enriches the researches of evaluating glyphosate  toxicity and probablely plays a warning role in herbicides used in farming.},

In the acute dosing experiment, limonene and β-myrcene  exposed groups demonstrated a significant decrease in locomotion, a decrease in  anxiety-like behaviour, and an increase in boldness, while linalool treatment  groups demonstrated only minor alterations in locomotion. Moreover, repeated  exposure to limonene (0.39\%) or β-myrcene (0.0083\%) for a seven day period did  not result in any significant behavioural effects.

Their effects at  environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning  mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the  most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic  acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of  zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual  substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours  post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as  malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements,  heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to  the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial  metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway  were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 μg/L) and the pesticide mixture  (1 μg/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of  21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in  larvae exposed to more than 100 μg/L of individual substances (craniofacial  deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 μg/L of  each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on  hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found.  Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53  gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance;  MESA 30 μg/L; and MOA 100 μg/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome  P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the  thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the  environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 μg/L of each  substance) and MESA metabolite (1 μg/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was  revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental  malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced  spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the thyroid system disruption represents a  likely hypothesis behind the effects caused by the low environmental  concentrations of S-metolachlor, its two metabolites and their mixture.},

There is accumulated evidence that some neurotoxic effects of PCB-95 are caused by  increased spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in neurons resulting from modifying  ryanodine receptors (RyR) in calcium-releasing channels. However, there are large  gaps in explaining brain and other developmental malformations on embryonic  PCB-95 exposure. In the present study, we address those deficiencies by studying  the toxic effects of PCB-95 using zebrafish as an ontogenetic model. To  characterize these effects, zebrafish embryos with intact chorions were exposed  to 4 different concentrations of PCB-95 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ppm) for 3  consecutive days. The controls were maintained in 0.5 × E2 medium or egg water  and in 0.1\% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/0.5 × E2 medium or egg water.  PCB-95-treated groups showed dose-dependent decreases in survival and hatching  rates, with increased rates of developmental malformations when compared to  controls. These include morphological malformations, brain cell necrosis, and  smaller eye sizes at 5 d post fertilization. These data suggest potential  mechanisms underlying the abnormal behavior observed in a visual stimulus assay.  The present study provides insight into PCB-95-induced developmental toxicity and  supports the use of the zebrafish model in understanding the effects of PCB-95  exposure.

However, in respect of  the presence or absence of the chorion, a consistent experimental methodology has  yet to be developed. In this study, we used a fixed exposure scheme to compare  the developmental toxicities of six major OPEs in chorionated and dechorionated  zebrafish embryos. Removal of the chorion increased sensitivity to OPEs: we found  higher incidence of mortality and malformation in dechorionated embryos. In a  behavioral assay, the locomotive activity of zebrafish larvae was consistently  inhibited by OPEs except tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate regardless of chorion  presence. However, at the molecular level, the expression of ZHE1 and mmp9 was  affected by the presence of the chorion in zebrafish embryos exposed to tributyl  phosphate and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), respectively. Furthermore, in zebrafish  embryos exposed to TPHP, the increased expression of miR-137 and miR-141 was  abolished by the presence of the chorion. Our results demonstrate for the first  time that the presence of the chorion influences phenotypic morbidity, organismal  behavior, and gene expression in zebrafish embryos exposed to chemicals; thus, we  suggest that dechorionation is desirable for exploring the toxicity mechanisms  that underlie effects of chemical exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental pollutants, including metals, pesticides and other organics, pose serious risks to many aquatic organisms. The acute toxicities to  zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio Hamilton \& Buchanan) were determined for two  organophosphorus insecticides, four pyrethroid insecticides and 50:50 binary  mixtures. RESULTS: At 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after treatment, LC(50) of permethrin,  tetramethrin, bifenthrin, etofenprox, dichlorvos and phoxim to zebrafish were  0.0052-0.0025, 0.0782-0.0460, 0.0065-0.0032, 0.0969-0.0791, 51.3-13.0 and  1.28-0.469 mg L(-1) respectively. LC(50) of permethrin + dichlorvos, permethrin +  phoxim, tetramethrin + dichlorvos, tetramethrin + phoxim, bifenthrin +  dichlorvos, bifenthrin + phoxim, etofenprox + dichlorvos and etofenprox + phoxim  were 0.0082-0.0046, 0.0078-0.0042, 0.264-0.124, 0.141-0.121, 0.0251-0.0154,  0.0154-0.0087, 0.396-0.217 and 0.213-0.0391 mg L(-1). CONCLUSION: Toxicity levels  of all pyrethroid insecticides to the zebrafish were high or very high. The  organophosphate dichlorvos showed low toxicity, but phoxim showed high or  intermediate toxicities to zebrafish, and the toxicities of binary mixtures of  permethrin and dichlorvos or phoxim, bifenthrin and dichlorvos or phoxim and  etofenprox and phoxim (48, 72 and 96 h exposure) were very high. The toxicities  of binary mixtures of tetramethrin and dichlorvos or phoxim, etofenprox and  dichlorvos and etofenprox and phoxim (24 h exposure) were high.},

In this study, water samples from six cross-sections  along the Xitiaoxi River Basin (XRB) were monthly or bimonthly collected in 2014.  The year-period physiochemical parameters as well as one-month-water sample based  acute biotoxicity tests showed that the river water quality of the year was  generally in a good status. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  screening based on one-month-water samples suggested that the organic pollutants  might be non-to-moderately-polar chemicals in very low concentrations.  One-month-water sample based RNA-seq was performed to measure the mRNA  differential expression profile of zebrafish larvae to furtherly explore the  potential bioeffect and the spatial water quality change of the river. Result  indicated that the number of deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) tended to  increase along the downstream direction of the river. Gene ontology (GO)  enrichment analysis implied that the key pollutants might mainly be the function  disruptors of biological processes. Principle components analysis (PCA) combining  with transcripts and one-month-water sample based physiochemical parameters  indicated that the pollution might be similar at TP, DP and CTB sites while  pollution homology existed on some extent between YBQ and JW sites. Although the  water quality of the river had a complex time-space alternation during the year,  and the one-month-data based RNA-seq could not reflex the whole year-water  quality of a watershed, the gene expression profile via RNA-seq provided an  alternative way for assessing integrated biotoxicity of surface water, and it was  relatively fit for early-warning of water quality of a watershed with  unobservable acute toxicity. However, the identification of detail toxicants and  the links between DEGs and pollution level as well as physiological-biochemical  toxicity needed further investigation.},

	abstract = {Diquat is a non-selective bipyridylium herbicide which has replaced its sister compound paraquat, as paraquat is associated to an increased risk for Parkinson's  disease. However, the propensity of diquat to propagate reactive oxygen species  ensures that diquat remains an exposure risk in non-target organisms. In this  study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to diquat (1, 10, 100μM)  beginning at ∼6h post fertilization for up to 7days to learn more about the  mechanisms underlying diquat toxicity during vertebrate development. Zebrafish  embryos exposed to diquat for 96h did not show any significant mortality nor  deformity compared to controls. Moreover, there was no difference in the timing  of hatch, an indicator of stress, for fish exposed to diquat. To determine  whether changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics occurred in early development as a  response to diquat exposure, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole  embryos. Basal respiration and ATP production were decreased following a 24h  diquat exposure at 100μM, suggesting that diquat negatively affects oxidative  phosphorylation. We also assessed locomotor behavior as a sensitive endpoint for  impaired activity and neurotoxicity. Seven day old (7 dpf) zebrafish treated with  diquat at the highest doses tested (10-100μM) showed an increase (hyper-activity)  in total distance travelled, velocity, movement cumulative duration, and overall  activity compared to unexposed fish. Lastly, in 7d fish, we measured transcripts  related to redox balance and apoptosis as diquat has been reported to induce  oxidative stress and can affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. Larvae exposed to  10μM diquat showed higher transcript levels of catalase compared to control fish,  implying that reactive oxygen species are produced following diquat exposure.  Transcript levels of sod1, sod2, bcl2, bax and caspase 3 however did not vary in  abundance among treatments with diquat. This study improves mechanistic  understanding of diquat in fish at early stages of development and presents  evidence that diquat disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics and behavior.},

However, the impact to swimming behavior from exposure  to mixtures of neurotoxicants has received little attention. In the current  study, we analyzed spontaneous swimming rates of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to  investigate in vivo mixture interactions involving two chemical classes.  Zebrafish were exposed to the neurotoxicants copper chloride (CuCl, 0.1 μM, 0.25  μM, 0.6 μM, or 6.3, 16, 40 ppb), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 0.1 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.6 μM, or  35, 88, 220 ppb) and binary mixtures for 24h to better understand the effects of  Cu on CPF neurotoxicity. Exposure to CPF increased the number of animals  undergoing freeze responses (an anti-predator behavior) and, at the highest CPF  dose (0.6 μM), elicited a decrease in zebrafish swimming rates. Interestingly,  the addition of Cu caused a reduction in the number of zebrafish in the CPF  exposure groups undergoing freeze responses. There was no evidence of additive or  synergistic toxicity between Cu and CPF. Although muscle AChE activity was  significantly reduced by CPF, there was a relatively poor relationship among  muscle AChE concentrations and swimming behavior, suggesting non-muscle AChE  mechanisms in the loss of swimming behavior. In summary, we have observed a  modulating effect of Cu on CPF swimming impairment that appears to involve both  AChE and non-AChE mechanisms. Our study supports the utility of zebrafish in  understanding chemical mixture interactions and neurobehavioral injury.},

Reactive oxygen species, antioxidant and oxidative  stress biomarkers, genotoxicity as well as cell cycle was evaluated in the liver  cell line from zebrafish (Danio rerio; ZF-L) exposed to 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and  1000 ng mL(-1) MgHP. MgHP affected cell stability by increasing reactive oxygen  species (ROS) in both exposure times (24 and 96 h) at high concentrations.  Catalase (CAT) activity decreased after 24 h exposure, and glutathione and  metallothionein values increased, avoiding the lipid peroxidation. Genotoxicity  increased as MgHP concentration increased, after 24 h exposure, exhibiting  nuclear abnormalities; it was recovered after 96 h exposure, evidencing possible  stimulation of DNA repair mechanisms. The alteration in the cell cycle  (increasing in the Sub-G1 phase and decreasing in the S-phase) was associated  with chromosomal instability. In conclusion, the responses of ROS and the  antioxidant defense system depended on MgHP concentration and time exposure,  while DNA exhibited some instability after 24 h exposure, which was recovered  after 96 h.},

The long-term effects of PM include changes in  non-motor behaviors such as fear and anxiety in larva and adults. Adults  embryonically exposed to PM also showed a significant increase in aggressiveness  parameters. These results demonstrated that embryonic exposure to PM induces  persistent neurotoxic effects in adulthood, which can impair the cognitive and  behavioral fitness of non-target species contributing to a rise in  neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Beta-cypermethrin, a type II synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in pest control. Several studies have demonstrated that beta-cypermethrin can affect  the reproductive system of mammals. However, there is still a scarcity of  information about the reproductive toxicity to fish induced by beta-cypermethrin  and its molecular mechanism. Therefore, this study was conducted to address this  scientific question, in which the adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 (blank  control), 0 (acetone solvent control), 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 μg/L of  beta-cypermethrin for 21 days. A decrease in cumulative egg production of  zebrafish was observed, indicating that beta-cypermethrin had a negative impact  on reproductive capacity of zebrafish. Regarding the histomorphological analysis  of gonads, the delay of gonadal development was observed after exposure for  21 days. In addition, significant changes in plasma 17β-estradiol (E2) and  testosterone (T) were found in zebrafish. Further exploration showed that the  transcription levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis-related genes  were remarkably changed, which corresponded well with the alterations of hormone  levels. These results demonstrated that beta-cypermethrin might have an adverse  effect on the reproduction system of zebrafish through delaying gonadal  development, disturbing sex hormone secretion, and affecting HPG axis gene  expression. This study suggests that beta-cypermethrin poses a potential threat  to the reproduction of fish populations, and the toxicity assessment of  beta-cypermethrin plays a vital role in the environmental risk assessment of  pesticides.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin (MLT)  was able to protect against FEN-induced behavior, oxidative stress, apoptosis,  and neurogenesis using zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Zebrafish exposed to 100  μg/L FEN for 120 h exhibited decreased swimming activity accompanied by  downregulated expression of neurogenesis-related genes (Dlx2, Shha, Ngn1, Elavl3,  and Gfap), suggesting that neurogenesis were impaired. In addition, FEN exposure  significantly elevated oxidative stress as evidenced by increased malondialdehyde  levels, as well as activities of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD),  catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Acridine orange staining demonstrated that  embryos treated with FEN for 120 h significantly enhanced apoptosis mainly in the  brain. FEN also produced upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic  genes (Bax, Fas, caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3) and decreased expression of  the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. MLT significantly attenuated the FEN-mediated  oxidative stress, modulated apoptotic-regulating genes, and diminished apoptotic  responses. Further, MLT blocked the FEN-induced effects on swimming behavior as  well as on neurogenesis-related genes. In conclusion, MLT protected against  FEN-induced developmental neurotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibiting  pesticide-mediated oxidative stress in zebrafish.},

In this study, we evaluated the enantioselective  toxicity of rac-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  through various malformations including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema,  crooked body, and short tails. The results showed that there were significant  differences in toxicity to zebrafish embryos caused by rac-metalaxyl and  R-metalaxyl, and the LC50 s at 96 h are 416.41 (353.91, 499.29) mg · L(-1) and  320.650 (279.80, 363.46) mg · L(-1) , respectively. In order to explore the  possible mechanism of the development defects, the genes involved in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (vtg1, vtg2, cyp17, cyp19a, cyp19b) and  hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (dio1, dio2, nis, tg, tpo) were quantified by  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results revealed  that there were no significant differences in the expression of vtg1, vtg2,  cyp17, cyp19a, and cyp19b after exposure to rac-metalaxyl. However, the  expression of vtg1, cyp19a, and cyp19b decreased significantly after exposure to  R-metalaxyl. And likewise, rac-metalaxyl only caused the upregulation of dio2,  while R-metalaxyl suppressed the expression of dio1 and tpo and induced the  expression of dio2 and nis. The change of gene expression may cause the  enantioselectivity in developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryo.

To date, little is understood of the  molecular mechanism driving the observed cardiac defects in exposed fishes. The  literature shows PCB \& TCDD derived cardiac defects are concurrent with, but not  caused by, expression of cyp1A, due to activation of the aryl hydrocarbon  receptor (AhR) gene activation pathway. However, in this study, detailed  visualization of fish hearts exposed to PCBs and TCDD show that, in addition to a  failure of cardiac looping in early heart development, the inner endocardial  lining of the heart fails to maintain proper cell adhesion and tissue integrity.  The resulting gap between the endocardium and myocardium in both zebrafish and  Atlantic sturgeon suggested functional faults in endothelial adherens junction  formation. Thus, we explored the molecular mechanism triggering cardiac defects  using immunohistochemistry to identify the location and phosphorylation state of  key regulatory and adhesion molecules. We hypothesized that PCB and TCDD  activates AhR, phosphorylating Src, which then phosphorylates the endothelial  adherens junction protein, VEcadherin. When phosphorylated, VEcadherin dimers,  found in the endocardium and vasculature, separate, reducing tissue integrity. In  zebrafish, treatment with PCB and TCDD contaminants leads to higher  phosphorylation of VEcadherin in cardiac tissue suggesting that these cells have  reduced connectivity. Small molecule inhibition of Src phosphorylation prevents  contaminant stimulated phosphorylation of VEcadherin and rescues both cardiac  function and gross morphology. Atlantic sturgeon hearts show parallels to  contaminant exposed zebrafish cardiac phenotype at the tissue level. These data  suggest that the mechanism for PCB and TCDD action in the heart is, in part,  distinct from the canonical mechanism described in the literature and that  cardiac defects are impacted by this nongenomic mechanism.},

Adult zebrafish at  ∼4 months of age were fed a measured amount of feed containing either a solvent  control or one of two doses of dieldrin (measured at 16, and 163.5 ng/g dry  weight) for 4 months. Dieldrin body burden levels in zebrafish after four-month  exposure were 0 (control), 11.47 ± 1.13 ng/g (low dose) and 18.32 ± 1.32 ng/g  (high dose) wet weight [mean ± std]. Extensive histopathology at the whole  organism level revealed that dieldrin exposure did not induce notable tissue  pathology, including the gastrointestinal tract. A repeated measure mixed model  analysis revealed that, while fish gained weight over time, there were no  dieldrin-specific effects on body weight. Fecal content was collected from the  gastrointestinal tract of males and 16S rRNA gene sequencing conducted. Dieldrin  at a measured feed dose of 16 ng/g reduced the abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum  involved in energy resorption. At the level of class, there was a decrease in  abundance of Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, and an increase in  Verrucomicrobiae species. We used a computational approach called predicted  relative metabolomic turnover (PRMT) to predict how a shift in microbial  community composition affects exchange of metabolites. Dieldrin was predicted to  affect metabolic turnover of uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I  [enzyme]-cysteine, hydrogen selenide, selenite, and methyl-selenic acid in the  fish gastrointestinal system. These pathways are related to bacterial heme  biosynthesis and selenium metabolism. Our study demonstrates that dietary  exposures to dieldrin can alter microbiota composition over 4 months, however the  long-term consequences of such impacts are not well understood.},

Five  representative pathogens (e.g., Alternaria solani) were used to investigate  enantioselective activity, and three non-target organisms (e.g., Selenastrum  bibraianum) were used to evaluate acute toxicity. S-Famoxadone was 3.00-6.59  times more effective than R-famoxadone. R-Famoxadone also showed 1.80-6.40 times  more toxicity than S-famoxadone toward S. bibraianum and Daphnia magna. The  toxicity of R-famoxadone was 100 times more toxic than S-famoxadone toward Danio  rerio. Under aerobic conditions, the half-life (t(1/2)) for famoxadone enantiomer  degradation was 46.2-126 days in different soils and the enantiomeric fraction  (EF) ranged from 0.435 to 0.470 after 120 days. R-Famoxadone preferentially  degraded in three soils, resulting in an enrichment of S-famoxadone. Under  anaerobic conditions, t(1/2) of famoxadone enantiomers was 62.4-147 days in  different soils and the EF ranged from 0.489 to 0.495, indicating that famoxadone  enantiomers were not enantioselective.

In the  present work, we performed lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses on brains of  zebrafish (F0-F2) from exposed and control lineages to identify molecular changes  that could explain the observed phenotypes. The use of both technologies  highlighted that F0 zebrafish displayed impaired mitochondrial function and lipid  metabolism regulation (depletion in triacylglycerols and phospholipids) which can  explain disruption of energy homeostasis. A subset of the regulated biological  pathways related to energetic metabolism and neurotransmission were inherited in  F2. In addition, there were increasing effects on epigenetic pathways from the F0  to the F2 generation. Altogether, we show that the effects of an environmental  exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on energetic metabolism as well as neurotransmission  extend over 2 generations of zebrafish, possibly due to transgenerational  epigenetic inheritance.},

The transcription of photoreceptor  opsin genes, and histopathological changes in the retina and visual behavior  (optokinetic and phototactic responses) were evaluated. TPhP significantly  downregulated the transcription of opsin genes (zfrho, opn1sw1, opn1sw2, opn1mw1,  opn1mw2, opn1mw3, opn1mw4, opn1lw1 and opn1lw2) in all exposure groups.  Histopathological analysis revealed that the areas of the outer nuclear layer  (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina  were significantly reduced in the 10 and 30 μg/L TPhP groups. The number of  ganglion cells was reduced significantly in the 30 μg/L group. The optokinetic  response (OKR) and phototactic response showed dose-dependent decreases caused by  impaired visual function, which was confirmed by unchanged locomotor activity.  The results indicated that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of  TPhP could inhibit the transcription of genes related to visual function and  impair retinal development, thus leading to visual impairment in zebraﬁsh larvae.},

Among different behavioral activities, aquatic  organisms' swimming behavior (fitness) is the essential factor for health  assessment; thus, it is practiced routinely in neurotoxicological studies.  Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are excellent models for neurotoxicology studies. Based  on the above information, we hypothesized that zebrafish's swimming behavior is a  potential biomarker for neurotoxic effect assessment. We exposed zebrafish  (length, 3-4 cm; weight, 0.2-0.3 g) to different synthetic organic chemicals  (organophosphorus flame retardants (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl  phosphate) and neurotoxic pesticides (cypermethrin and methomyl) for 15 days. For  each test chemical, we chose two different concentrations (Treatment-I 5 μL/L and  Treatment-II 25 μL/L) to study their eco-toxicity. The swimming strength of  zebrafish was quantified using an online monitoring system. The swimming strength  of zebrafish decreased under different treatments (Treatment-I (5 μL/L) and -II  (25 μL/L)) of target chemicals. The circadian rhythm of zebrafish was  predominantly not affected in this study. Higher neurotoxic effect (behavioral  impairment) was observed in Treatment-II when compare to Treatment-I of  organophosphorus flame retardants and pesticides groups. Responses of zebrafish  under organophosphorus flame retardant (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl  phosphate) treatments were identical with pesticide (cypermethrin and methomyl)  treatments. Based on the results, we conclude that swimming behavior could be an  ideal non-invasive biomarker to assess waterborne contaminants' neurotoxic  effect.},

It is  considered to be a new candidate for the persistent organic pollutants group.  Endosulfan residues in the environment may cause serious damage to ecosystems,  especially in aquatic environments. The present study was conducted to  investigate the effect of endosulfan on antioxidant enzymes [catalase (CAT) and  superoxide dismutase (SOD)], reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA  damage in zebrafish. Male and female zebrafish were separated and exposed to a  control solution and four concentrations of endosulfan (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg  L⁻¹) and were sampled after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. It is noteworthy that the  present research explored the correlation among the three indicators induced by  endosulfan. Low endosulfan concentrations (0.01 μg L⁻¹) induced a slight increase  of SOD and CAT activity, which kept ROS in a stable level. High endosulfan  concentration (10 μg L⁻¹) induced excessive ROS production which exceeded the  capacity of the cellular antioxidants and exhausted the enzyme including CAT and  SOD. The DNA damage of zebrafish was evaluated by single-cell gel electrophoresis  and was enhanced with increasing endosulfan concentration. In conclusion, the  present study showed that endosulfan (0.01-10 μg L⁻¹) has toxic effects on  zebrafish.},

Apart from motor deficits, PD reduces patient's quality of life  through sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment and emotional disorders.  However, it's unclear whether bad life habits such as stay up late exacerbate the  patient's cognition and emotional disorders. Thus we investigated the  consequences of sleep deprivation (SD) on memory and emotions using a  rotenone-based zebrafish model of PD. Behavioral assays, using locomotor activity  assay, showed that rotenone treated zebrafish exhibited PD-like symptoms, whereas  sleep deprivation didn't exacerbate the progression of them. The object  discrimination task exhibited that the short-term cognitive deficits of rotenone  group are more serious than the sham group after SD. Light-dark box test showed  that rotenone treated fish are more dysphoric than the sham fish after SD.  Dopamine and DOPAC significantly reduced in rotenone treated fish compared with  the sham fish. However, this DOPAC reduction recovered after SD. The expression  of D2 and D3 in rotenone treated zebrafish elevated compared with sham group and  SD group. However, the rotenone treated zebrafish manifested a decrease level of  D2 and D3 after SD. D1 did not show any significantly changes among the four  groups. Our findings suggest that zebrafish treated with rotenone may have a more  severe damage of memory and emotional function after SD, which may be related to  the changes in the DA systems.},

This  video analysis-based assay automatically segmented every embryo and thus was able  to accurately quantify spontaneous movement features, including frequency,  duration, intensity, interval, and the number of continuous movements. When  tested with eight environmental substances known to be neurodevelopmental  toxicants, such as chlorpyrifos and bisphenol A, the assay successfully captured  frequency alterations that were well-documented in previous studies while also  providing additional information. Using an optimized procedure, we further  assessed 132 potential neurotoxins that spanned a wide range of molecular  targets, many of which were previously detected in environmental waterbodies. The  distinct altered behavioral barcodes indicated that the spontaneous movement was  impacted by diverse neuroactive substances, and the effects could be effectively  evaluated with the developed assay.

Biosafety assessment of methanol extract of A.  radiata leaves on embryos of Danio rerio (Zebra fish) and Artemia nauplii (micro  crustacean) revealed that there were no destructive or teratogenic effects.

TPhP was found to have high bioconcentrations in zebrafish  larvae after exposure. Further, it significantly reduced locomotor activity as  well as the heart rate at the 100 μg/L concentration. TPhP exposure significantly  altered the content of the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric and histamine.  Downregulation of the genes related to central nervous system development (e.g.,  α1-tubulin, mbp, syn2a, shha, and elavl3) as well as the corresponding proteins  (e.g., α1-tubulin, mbp, and syn2a) was observed, but the gap-43 protein was found  to upregulated. Finally, marked inhibition of total acetylcholinesterase  activity, which is considered as a biomarker of neurotoxicant exposure, was also  observed in the larvae. Our results indicate that exposure to environmentally  relevant concentrations of TPhP can affect different parameters related to center  nervous system development, and thus contribute to developmental neurotoxicity in  early developing zebrafish larvae.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin has been increasingly employed for pest control in urban and agricultural areas, putting  humans and wildlife at increased risk of exposure. Exposures to nanomolar (nM)  concentrations of bifenthrin have recently been reported to alter calcium  oscillations in rodent neurons. Neuronal calcium oscillations are influenced by  ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity, which modulates calcium-dependent signaling  cascades, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.  RyR activity and mTOR signaling play critical roles in regulating  neurodevelopmental processes. However, whether environmentally relevant levels of  bifenthrin alter RyR or mTOR signaling pathways to influence neurodevelopment has  not been addressed. Therefore, our main objectives in this study were to examine  the transcriptomic responses of genes involved in RyR and mTOR signaling pathways  in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin,  and to assess the potential functional consequences by measuring locomotor  responses to external stimuli. Wildtype zebrafish were exposed for 1, 3 and 5  days to 1, 10 and 50 ng/L bifenthrin, followed by a 14 d recovery period.  Bifenthrin elicited significant concentration-dependent transcriptional responses  in the majority of genes examined in both signaling cascades, and at all time  points examined during the acute exposure period (1, 3, and 5 days post  fertilization; dpf), and at the post recovery assessment time point (19 dpf).  Changes in locomotor behavior were not evident during the acute exposure period,  but were observed at 19 dpf, with main effects (increased locomotor behavior)  detected in fish exposed developmentally to bifenthrin at 1 or 10 ng/L, but not  50 ng/L. These findings illustrate significant influences of developmental  exposures to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin on neurodevelopmental  processes in zebrafish.},

In vivo pyriproxyfen  treatment was carried out to study oxidative stress, and conduct morphological  analysis of the testis and liver. Whole testes were incubated in vitro  with/without pyriproxyfen (10(-12), 10(-9) or 10(-6) M; 30 min) and (45)Ca(2+)  influx determined. To study pyriproxyfen's mechanism of action,  inhibitors/activators of ionic channels or pumps/exchangers, protein kinase  inhibitors or a calcium chelator were added 15 min before the addition of  (45)Ca(2+) and pyriproxyfen. We evaluated the in vivo effects of 7 day exposure  to waterborne pyriproxyfen (10(-9) M) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation,  lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione content (GSH), glutathione  S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and  γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity. Morphological analyses of the testis and  liver were carried out after in vivo exposure of D. rerio to pyriproxyfen.  Pyriproxyfen increased (45)Ca(2+) influx by opening the voltage-dependent T-type  channels (T-type VDCC), inhibiting sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (45)Ca(2+)-ATPase  (SERCA) and the NCX exchanger (forward mode) and by mobilizing calcium from  stores. The involvement of potassium channels and protein kinase C (PKC) was also  demonstrated in pyriproxyfen-induced intracellular calcium elevation. In vivo  pyriproxyfen treatment of D. rerio increased lipid peroxidation, decreased GSH  content and increased GST activity in testes, in addition to increasing the  number and size of spermatogonia cysts and inducing hepatocyte basophilia and  dilation of blood vessels in the liver. The toxicity of pyriproxyfen is mediated  by calcium overload, increased lipid peroxidation, and a diminished antioxidant  capacity in the testis, due to GSH depletion, and altered spermatogenesis. The  development of high basophilia in the liver suggests that pyriproxyfen may have  estrogenic activity, possibly acting as an endocrine-disruptor. These findings  indicate that these alterations may contribute to pyriproxyfen toxicity and  spermatogenesis disruption.},

Therefore, firstly we explored the  toxic effects and possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity induced by TF  using zebrafish model. Zebrafish at stage of 48 h post fertilization (hpf)  exposed to TF for 24 h exhibited morphological malformations which were further  confirmed by histopathologic examination, including pericardial edema,  circulation abnormalities, serious venous thrombosis and increased distance  between the sinus venosus (SV) and bulbus arteriosus (BA) regions of the heart.  In addition to morphological changes, TF induced functional deficits in the heart  of zebrafish, including bradycardia and a significant reduced cardiac output that  became more serious at higher concentrations. To better understand the possible  molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish, we  investigated the transcriptional level of genes related to calcium signaling  pathway and cardiac muscle contraction. Q-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase  chain reaction) results demonstrated that the expression level of genes related  to ATPase (atp2a1l, atp1b2b, atp1a3b), calcium channel (cacna1ab, cacna1da) and  cardiac troponin C (tnnc1a) were significantly decreased after TF exposure. For  the first time, the present study revealed that TF exposure had observable  morphological and functional negative impacts on cardiovascular system of  zebrafish. Mechanistically, this toxicity might result from the pressure of  down-regulation of genes associated with calcium signaling pathway and cardiac  muscle contraction following TF exposure. These findings generated here can  provide information for better pesticide poisoning treatments, occupational  disease prevention, and providing theoretical foundation for risk management  measures.},

Imazalil is a widely used chiral fungicide; its parent and major  metabolite R14821 (imazalil-M) are usually detected in environmental and plant  samples. The enantioselective bioactivity of imazalil enantiomers to seven  typical pathogens (e.g., Fulvia fulva) was explored. S-(+)-Imazalil showed  3.00-6.59 times higher bioactivity than its antipode for selected pathogens.  Molecular docking partly explained the mechanism of enantioselectivity in  bioactivity. S-(+)-Imazalil had a stronger hydrophobic interaction and lower  energy conformation with binding sites than R-(-)-imazalil. The acute toxicity of  S-(+)-imazalil was 1.23-fold and 2.25-fold more than R-(-)-imazalil to P.  subcapitata and D. magna, respectively. And, S-(+)-imazalil-M had 2.21-fold and  1.70-fold higher toxicity than R-(-)-imazalil-M to P. subcapitata and D. magna,  respectively. However, R-(-)-imazalil was 1.21 times more toxic than  S-(+)-imazalil to D. rerio. The enantioselective dissipation of imazalil and  imazalil-M was explored under greenhouse conditions. High-effective  S-(+)-imazalil preferentially enriched in leaf and fruit of tomato and cucumber,  and no enantioselective degradation was found in soil. Imazalil-M enantiomers  formed in cucumber, leaf of cucumber, and tomato, and the EF values fluctuated  between 0.332 and 0.499. The results could provide information for more accurate  assessment of imazalil; they implicated that using S-(+)-imazalil could reduce  pesticide input and the risk to D. rerio.},

Here, zebrafish larvae were exposed, from 1.5 to 120 h  post-fertilization, to a broad concentration range (0.05-10.000 μg/L) of  glyphosate to explore its impact on the brain. We evaluated morphology, tracked  locomotor behavior and neurophysiological parameters, examined  neuro-glio-vascular cell structures, and outlined transcriptomic outcomes by RNA  sequencing. At the concentration range tested, glyphosate did not elicit gross  morphological changes. Behavioral analysis revealed a significant decrease in  locomotor activity following the exposure to 1000 μg/L glyphosate or higher. In  parallel, midbrain electrophysiological recordings indicated abnormal, and  variable, spike activity in zebrafish larvae exposed to 1000 μg/L glyphosate.  Next, we asked whether the observed neurophysiological outcome could be secondary  to brain structural modifications. We used transgenic zebrafish and in vivo  2-photon microscopy to examine, at the cellular level, the effects of the  behavior-modifying concentration of 1000 μg/L, comparing to low 0.1 μg/L, and  control. We ruled out the presence of cerebrovascular and neuronal malformations.  However, microglia morphological modifications were visible at the two glyphosate  concentrations, specifically the presence of amoeboid cells suggestive of  activation. Lastly, RNAseq analysis showed the deregulation of transcript  families implicated in neuronal physiology, synaptic transmission, and  inflammation, as evaluated at the two selected glyphosate concentrations. In  zebrafish larvae, behavioral and neurophysiological defects occur after the  exposure to high glyphosate concentrations while cellular and transcript  signatures can be detected in response to low dose. The prospective applicability  to ecotoxicology and the possible extension to brain-health vulnerability are  critically discussed.},

However, no reports have been issued on the effects of different  enantiomers on locomotor behavior for synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) in zebrafish,  and whether locomotor activity is associated with the developmental toxicities  remains unclear. In this study, enantioselectivity of BF (1S and 1R) on the acute  locomotor activity and developmental toxicities of embryonic-larval zebrafish  were first evaluated. The results indicated that 1R-BF was more toxic, causing  morphological impairments, with a 96-h median effective concentration (EC50) of  226 microg/L for pericardial edema and 145 microg/L for curved body axis.  Administration of 20 microg/L of one enantiomer of BF had differential effects on  the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 4 d postfertilization (dpf) under  alternating light and dark conditions. Larvae treated with 1R-BF were not  sensitive to the alteration of light to dark, and the locomotor activities were  reduced to a level similar to that observed in light, which otherwise increased  rapidly and markedly. However, 1S-BF did not alter the general pattern of  zebrafish response to the light or dark compared with the control. The results  demonstrated that the differential effects on development might have contributed  to the enantioselectivity in the locomotor activity. The consistency of  enantioselectivity with insecticidal activity may also indicate a common mode of  action. Furthermore, 1R-BF accelerated the spontaneous movement and hatching  process, whereas 1S-BF seemed to be inhibitory. The results suggest the need to  link behavioral changes to developmental toxicities in order to achieve more  comprehensive health risk assessments of chiral pesticides.},

Rotenone inhibits mitochondrial respiratory  complex 1 (MRC1) and causes reactive oxygen species formation. Mass spectrometry  (MS)-based phosphoproteomic methods enable discovering specific signaling events  in special molecular pathways through identification and quantification of  phosphoproteins.

Microtubule-associated protein  (MAP) family members were significantly lower in rotenone group. Phosphoproteins  involved in ion binding (calcium, magnesium, zinc ion), oxygen binding,  microtubule binding, ATP- and GTP-binding were among differentially expressed 347  proteins in rotenone group and they were reversed after octanoic acid treatments.  Phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites were identified for future exploration  of signaling pathways involved in rotenone toxicity.

However, most studies reported its mitochondrial toxicity with  respect to a single form, which is far from the environmentally relevant  conditions. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to five OCPs: chlordane,  heptachlor, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT),  β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), as well as an equal  ratio mixture of these OCPs. We evaluated mitochondrial function, including  oxygen consumption, the activity of mitochondrial complexes, antioxidant  reactions, and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. Oxygen  consumption rate was reduced by exposure to chlordane, and β-HCH, linking to the  increased activity of specific mitochondrial complex I and III, and decreased GSH  level. We found that these mitochondrial dysfunctions were more significant in  the exposure to the OCP mixture than the individual OCPs. On the mRNA  transcription level, the individual OCPs mainly dysregulated the metabolic cycle  (i.e., cs and acadm), whereas the OCP mixture disrupted the genes related to  mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., sdha). Consequently, we  demonstrate that the OCP mixture disrupts mitochondrial metabolism by a different  molecular mechanism than the individual OCPs, which warrants further study to  evaluate mitochondrial dysregulation by chronic exposure to the OCP mixture.},

Embryonic atrazine  exposure resulted in a significant increase in progesterone levels in the 3 and  30 ppb groups. A significant decrease in spawning and a significant increase in  follicular atresia in the 30 ppb group were observed. In offspring, a decrease in  the head length to body ratio in the 30 ppb group, along with a significant  increase in head width to body ratio in the 0.3 and 3 ppb groups occurred.  Transcriptomic alterations involved genes associated with endocrine system  development and function, tissue development, and behavior. This study provides  evidence to support atrazine as an EDC causing reproductive dysfunction and  molecular alterations in adults exposed only during embryogenesis and  morphological alterations in their offspring.},

In this study, we studied the changes of toxicity of triphenyl  phosphate (TPhP) to zebrafish, in the presence of micro-polystyrene (MPS, 5.8 μm)  and nano-polystyrene (NPS, 46 nm). Results indicated that separate MPS and NPS  had no acute toxicity and little reproductive toxicity on zebrafish. TPhP alone  was a highly toxic substance with a median lethal concentration (LC(50)) of  976 μg/L, the presence of MPS and NPS did not have significant effect on the  acute toxicity of TPhP. TPhP alone stimulated the enlargement of liver and gonad  of fish (except the testis) by 1.25-2.12 fold, and the presence of NPS further  aggravated this stimulation by 1.23-2.84 fold, while MPS did not. The gonadal  histology indicated that comparing with TPhP alone, the addition of MPS and NPS  further inhibited the process of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, even causing  obvious lacunas in testis and atretic follicles oocytes in ovary. Meanwhile, TPhP  did not significantly disturb the hormone homeostasis (E(2)/T) and vitellogenin  (Vtg) content in fish, but the presence of NPS increased the E(2)/T ratio and Vtg  content in male fish, while slightly decreased those in female fish, which  implying that effects of PS was sex-dependent. As a result, the egg production,  the fertilization rate and hatchability of eggs significantly reduced after  combined TPhP+PS exposure, demonstrating that co-occurrence of TPhP and PS,  especially NPS, could greatly impaired the reproductive performance of zebrafish.},

Olfaction mediates behaviors pivotal for survival, such as feeding,  mating, social behavior, and danger assessment. The olfactory organs are directly  exposed to the milieu, and thus are particularly vulnerable to damage by  environmental pollutants and toxicants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and  surfactants, among others. Given the widespread occurrence of olfactory  toxicants, there is a pressing need to understand the effects of these harmful  compounds on olfactory function. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for  studying human physiology, disease, and toxicity. Additionally, the anatomical  components of the zebrafish olfactory system are similar to those of other  vertebrates, and they present a remarkable degree of regeneration and  neuroplasticity, making it an ideal model for the study of regeneration,  reorganization and repair mechanisms following olfactory toxicant exposure. In  this review, we focus on (1) the anatomical, morphological, and functional  organization of the olfactory system of zebrafish; (2) the adverse effects of  olfactory toxicants and injury to the olfactory organ; and (3) remodeling and  repair neuroplasticity mechanisms following injury and degeneration by olfactory  toxicant exposure.},

In the present study, early developmental stage zebrafish  were used as the subject organisms to assess the toxicity of EPX, and the  possible mechanism of toxicity was also discussed by biochemical and  transcriptomic analysis. Through embryo toxicity test, we had made it clear that  the 96 h LC(50) of embryo was 7.204 mg/L, and acute exposure to EPX effected  hatching rate, heartbeats, body length and even morphological defects. Then, by  being exposed to EPX for 7 days at concentrations of 175 (1/40 LC(50)), 350 (1/20  LC(50)) and 700 (1/10 LC(50)), biochemical parameters were affected, mainly  manifested as increase of the triglyceride (TG) level and decrease of glucose  content. Correspondingly, the transcription of genes related of glucose  metabolism, lipid metabolism and cholesterol metabolism were also affected  significantly in larval zebrafish. Moreover, some pathways, including lipid  metabolism, glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism were affected through  transcriptome sequencing analysis in the larval zebrafish. Further data analysis  based on the sequencing, EPX exposure also affected the expression of genes  related to cell apoptosis. We further conformed that the bright fluorescence on  the liver and bright spots near the liver by acridine orange staining. In  addition, the mRNA levels of apoptosis related genes were also significantly  affected in the EPX exposed larval zebrafish. Taken together, the work could  provide an insight into toxic effects of EPX on the zebrafish larvae at embryo  toxicity and transcriptional levels, providing some evidences for the toxic  effects of triazole fungicides on non-target organisms.},

	abstract = {Metolachlor herbicides are derived from the chloroacetamide chemical family of which there are the S- and R-metolachlor isomers. S-metolachlor is a selective  herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The  herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in  aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects  of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor  light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval  locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed  zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 µM)  over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and  increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 µM and above.  Exposure levels as high as 200 µM for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen  consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints  related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of  swim bladder inflation at 50 µM in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related  to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the  swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia  homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish  exposed to 50 µM while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance,  corresponding to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response  test revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light  with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 µM) resulted  in hypoactivity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis indicated that there was a  positive relationship between surface area of the swim bladder and distance  traveled, and the size of the swim bladder explained {\textasciitilde}10-14\% in the variation for  total distance moved. Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test,  and we did not detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration  tested. Here we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure  to the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may disrupt  transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and morphology, which could  ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity. These data are expected to  contribute to further risk assessment guidelines for S-metolachlor in aquatic  ecosystems.},

Nevertheless,  the combined toxicity of NPs and the pesticides that were used world-widely still  remains unclear. Cypermethrin (CYP), a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is  commonly used for controlling agricultural and indoor pests. Therefore, the  effects of titanium dioxide NPs (nTiO(2)) on CYP bioconcentration and its effects  on the neuronal development in zebrafish were investigated in our study.  Zebrafish embryos (2- hour-post-fertilization, hpf) were exposed to CYP (0, 0.4,  2 and 10 μg/L) alone or co-exposed with nTiO(2) (1 mg/L) until 120-hpf. nTiO(2)  is taken up by zebrafish larvae and also it can adsorb CYP. The zebrafish body  burdens of CYP was observed and CYP uptake was increased by nTiO(2), indicating  that the nTiO(2) could accelerate the bioaccumulation of CYP in larvae.  Co-exposure of nTiO(2) and CYP induced the generation of reactive oxygen species.  Exposure to CYP alone significantly decreased the mRNA expression of genes,  including glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), α1-tubulin, myelin basic  protein (mbp) and growth associated protein (gap-43). Besides, reductions of  serotonin, dopamine and GABA concentrations were observed in zebrafish and the  larval locomotion was significantly decreased in response to the lower level of  the neurotransmitters. Moreover, co-exposure of nTiO(2) and CYP caused further  significantly decreased in the locomotion activity, and enhanced the  down-regulation of the mRNA expression of specific genes and the  neurotransmitters levels. The results demonstrated that nTiO(2) increased CYP  accumulation and enhanced CYP-induced developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish.},

In this study, zebrafish larvae at 4 days post  fertilization (dpf) were exposed to a range of pyraclostrobin for 96 h to assess  its acute toxicity and effects on mitochondria. Pyraclostrobin at 36 μg/L or  higher concentrations caused significant influences on larval heart and brain  including pericardial edema, brain damage malformations, histological and  mitochondrial structural damage of the two organs. The results of RNA-Seq  revealed that the transcripts of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation,  cardiac muscle contraction, mitochondrion, nervous system development and  glutamate receptor activity were significantly influenced by 36 μg/L  pyraclostrobin. Further tests showed that pyraclostrobin at 18 and 36 μg/L  reduced the concentrations of proteins related to cardiac muscle contraction,  impaired cardiac function, inhibited glutamate receptors activities and  suppressed locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. Negative changes in  mitochondrial complex activities, as well as reduced ATP content were also  observed in larvae treated with 18 and 36 μg/L pyraclostrobin. These results  suggested that pyraclostrobin exposure caused cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity in  zebrafish larvae and mitochondrial dysfunction might be the underlying mechanism  of pyraclostrobin toxicity.},

We employed zebrafish larva (transgenic SR4G line)  with a cortisol-inducible green fluorescence protein reporter (eGFP) as a model  to detect stress responses upon exposure to compounds with environmental impact,  including bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin (VIN), and fluoxetine (FLX). Cortisol,  fluorescence signal, and mRNA levels of eGFP and 11 targeted genes were measured  in a homogenized pool of zebrafish larvae, with six experimental replicates for  each endpoint. Eleven targeted genes were selected according to their association  with stress-axis and immediate early response class of genes. Hydrocortisone  (CORT)and dexamethasone (DEX) were used as positive and negative controls,  respectively. All measurements were done in two unstressed and stressed condition  using standardized net handling as the stressor. A significant positive linear  correlation between cortisol levels and eGFP mRNA levels was observed (r{\textgreater} 0.9).  Based on eGFP mRNA levels in unstressed and stressed larvae two predictive models  were trained (Random Forest and Logistic Regression). Both these models could  correctly predict the blunted stress response upon exposure to BPA, VIN, FLX and  the negative control, DEX. The negative predictive value (NPV) of these models  were 100\%. Similar NPV was observed when the predictive models trained based on  the mRNA levels of the eleven assessed genes. Measurement of whole-body  fluorescence intensity signal was not significant to detect blunted stress  response. Our findings support the use of SR4G transgenic larvae as an in vivo  biomonitoring model to screen chemicals for their stress-disrupting potentials.  This is important because there is increasing evidence that brief exposures to  environmental pollutants modify the stress response and critical coping behaviors  for several generations.},

Consequently, toxic compounds reach nontarget organisms. For  instance, aquatic organisms can be exposed to tebuconazole-based fungicides  (TBF), glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), and atrazine-based herbicides (ABH)  that are potentially dangerous, which motivates the following question: Are these  agrichemicals attractant or aversive to fish? To answer this question, adult  zebrafish were tested in a chamber that allows fish to escape from or seek a lane  of contaminated water. This attraction and aversion paradigm was evaluated with  zebrafish in the presence of an acute contamination with these compounds. We  showed that only GBH was aversive to fish, whereas ABH and TBF caused neither  attraction nor aversion for zebrafish. Thus, these chemicals do not impose an  extra toxic risk by being an attractant for fish, although TBF and ABH can be  more deleterious, because they induce no aversive response. Because the uptake  and bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish seems to be time- and dose-dependent, a  fish that remains longer in the presence of these substances tends to absorb  higher concentrations than one that escapes from contaminated sites.},

Besides the light-dark cycle, there are additional environmental factors that  regulate the circadian rhythms in animals as well as humans. Here, we outline the  circadian rhythm system and considers zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a representative  vertebrate organism. We characterize multiple physiological processes, which are  affected by circadian rhythm disrupting compounds (circadian disrupters). We  focus on and summarize 40 natural and anthropogenic environmental circadian  disrupters in fish. They can be divided into six major categories: steroid  hormones, metals, pesticides and biocides, polychlorinated biphenyls, neuroactive  drugs and other compounds such as cyanobacterial toxins and bisphenol A. Steroid  hormones as well as metals are most studied. Especially for progestins and  glucocorticoids, circadian dysregulation was demonstrated in zebrafish on the  molecular and physiological level, which comprise mainly behavioral alterations.  Our review summarizes the current state of knowledge on circadian disrupters,  highlights their risks to fish and identifies knowledge gaps in animals and  humans. While most studies focus on transcriptional and behavioral alterations,  additional effects and consequences are underexplored. Forthcoming studies should  explore, which additional environmental circadian disrupters exist. They should  clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and aim to better understand the  consequences for physiological processes.},

In this study, to clarify the risk of  broflanilide to aquatic organisms and explore its possible mechanism, lethal and  sub-lethal exposure of zebrafish embryos were performed. The acute toxicity  LC(50) (50\% lethal concentration) (96 h) of broflanilide to zebrafish embryos and  larvae were 3.72 mg/L and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. It also caused toxic symptoms  including reduced heart rate, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema and shortened  larval body length at ≥ 0.2 mg/L. Understanding the cellular and molecular  changes underlying developmental toxicity in early stages of zebrafish may be  very important to further improvement of this study. Here, we found cell  apoptosis in embryonic heart, significant up-regulation in expression of genes  associated with apoptosis and increased activity of caspase-9. In particular, we  detected the levels of genes and TBX5 (T-box protein 5) related to cardiac  development, which were significantly increased in this study and may be  contribution to the cardiotoxicity of embryos. In general, our results identified  the aquatic toxicity of broflanilide to the early stage of zebrafish and provide  insights into the underlying mechanism in developmental toxicity especially  cardiotoxicity of embryos.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a neurotoxic insecticide, is implicated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children through  noncholinergic mechanisms. METHODS: This review presents qualitative and  quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and  Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring  at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). RESULTS:  CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment  showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function  (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C.  elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of  specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating  those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance  among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor  activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for  effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day  10-14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses  (≤1.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF  treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction  associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for  all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses  approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition. CONCLUSIONS:  Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF  neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms. Variability in laboratories,  exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal species/strain might have contributed to  the inconsistent results. The detrimental CPF effects during early development  are relevant to human populations.},

	abstract = {The zebrafish Danio rerio is a model vertebrate organism for understanding biological mechanisms. Recent studies have explored using zebrafish as a model  for lipid-related diseases, for in vivo fish bioassays, and for embryonic  toxicity experiments. Mass spectrometry (MS) and MS imaging are established tools  for lipid profiling and spatial mapping of biomolecules and offer rapid,  sensitive, and simple analytical protocols for zebrafish analysis. When ambient  ionization techniques are used, ions are generated in native environmental  conditions, requiring neither sample preparation nor separation of molecules  prior to MS. We used two direct MS techniques to describe the dynamics of the  lipid profile during zebrafish embryonic development from 0 to 96 hours  post-fertilization and to explore these analytical approaches as molecular  diagnostic assays. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS imaging followed  by nanoelectrospray (nESI) MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) were used in positive and  negative ion modes, allowing the detection of a large variety of  phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, free fatty  acids, triacylglycerols, ubiquinone, squalene, and other lipids, and revealed  information on the spatial distributions of lipids within the embryo and on lipid  molecular structure. Differences were observed in the relative ion abundances of  free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and ubiquinone - essentially localized to the  yolk - across developmental stages, whereas no relevant differences were found in  the distribution of complex membrane glycerophospholipids, indicating conserved  lipid constitution. Embryos exposed to trichloroethylene for 72 hours exhibited  an altered lipid profile, indicating the potential utility of this technique for  testing the effects of environmental contaminants.},

In this study, zebrafish embryos at 6 h  post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L clethodim  for up to 24 hpf, and zebrafish larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were  exposed to the same density gradient for 24 h. Our results showed that clethodim  could cause head and cardiovascular malformations in embryos: blurred brain  ventricles, unapparent brain regions, condensation of nucleus and cytoplasm in  brain cells, increased intercellular space, developmental malformations of eyes  and ears, reduced neonatal neurons, disorder migration of neural ridge cells;  morphological aberrations of the vascular ICM, slowing of heart beat and blood  flow, reduction of circulating red blood cells, and delayed development of head  and tail blood vessels. These defects could be a result of clethodim-induced  oxidative stress and decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which in  turn affected the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, decreased ATPase  activity, and ultimately led to developmental malformations. The swimming  behaviour of zebrafish larvae was observed to decrease with increasing  concentration of clethodim exposure, but the angular velocity and mobility  increased. These could be due to reduced AChE activity and disturbed gene  expression of GABA, dopamine and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems, which  thus altered the locomotor behaviour. In summary, we found that clethodim induces  developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and larvae.},

Herein, we investigated the effects  of TCPP exposure on zebrafish neurodevelopment and swimming behavior to elucidate  the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Under TCPP gradient  concentration exposure, the hatching rates were declined by up to 33.3\% in  72 hpf, and the malformation rates increased from 15\% to 50\%. Meanwhile, TCPP led  to abnormal behaviors including decreased locomotive activity in the dark and  slow/insensitive responses to sound and light stimulation of larvae. TCPP caused  excessive apoptosis and ROS accumulation in early embryonic development, with  hair cell defects and structural deformity of neuromast. Abnormal expression of  neurodevelopment (pax6a, nova1, sox11b, syn2a, foxo3a and robo2) and  apoptosis-related genes (baxa, bcl2a and casp8) revealed molecular mechanisms  regarding abnormal behavioral and phenotypic symptoms. Chronic TCPP exposure led  to anxiety-like behavior and excessive panic, lower capacity for discrimination  and risk avoidance, and conditioned place preference in adults. Social  interaction tests demonstrated that long-term TCPP stress resulted in unsociable,  eccentric, lonely and silent behaviors in adults. Zebrafish memory and cognitive  function were severely reduced as concluded from T-maze tests. Potential  mechanisms triggering behavioral abnormality were attributed to histopathological  injury of diencephalon, abnormal changes in nerve-related genes at transcription  and expression levels, and inhibited activity of AChE by TCPP stress. These  findings provide an important reference for risk assessment and early warning to  TCPP exposure, and offer insights for prevention/mitigation of pollutant-induced  nervous system diseases.},

Moreover, the stereoselective degradation of difenoconazole in vegetables  (cucumber, Cucumis sativus and tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum) under field  conditions and in soil under laboratory-controlled conditions (aerobic and  anaerobic) was investigated. There were 1.33-24.2-fold and 1.04-6.78-fold  differences in bioactivity and toxicity, respectively. Investigations on the  stereoselective degradation of difenoconazole in vegetables showed that the  highest-toxic and lowest-bioactive (2S,4S)-stereoisomer displays a different  enrichment behavior in different plant species. Under aerobic or anaerobic  conditions, (2R,4R)- and (2R,4S)-difenoconazole were preferentially degraded in  the soil. Moreover, difenoconazole was configurationally stable in the test soil  matrices. On the basis of biological activity, ecotoxicity, and environmental  behavior, it is likely that the use of pure (2R,4S)-difenoconazole instead of the  commercial stereoisomer mix may help to increase the bioactivity and reduce  environmental pollution.},

One  component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops  is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause  neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have  indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming  to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and  Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how  chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and  sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social  interaction and locomotor tests (p {\textgreater} 0.05). However, several exceptions have been  noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their  locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p {\textless} 0.05). We  further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as  represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no  statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control  group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone + probiotics (p {\textgreater} 0.05), relevant  changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p {\textless} 0.05 and p {\textless} 0.005,  respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) have been  observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the  other three groups.

We found that developmental hypoxia resulted in  decreased spontaneous swimming behavior in larva, and that this motor impairment  persisted into adulthood. In evaluation of the diencephalic dopaminergic neurons,  which regulate early development of locomotion and constitute an evolutionarily  conserved component of the vertebrate dopaminergic system, hypoxia caused a  decrease in the number of synapses from the descending dopaminergic  diencephalospinal tract (DDT) to spinal cord motor neurons. Moreover, dopamine  signaling from the DDT was coupled jointly to motor neuron synaptogenesis and to  locomotor development. Together, these results demonstrate the developmental  processes regulating early locomotor development and a requirement for  dopaminergic projections and motor neuron synaptogenesis.

	abstract = {Animal behaviour is the interaction between environment and an individual organism, which also can be influenced by its neighbours. Variations in  environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to  neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of  the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is  frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish  is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of  different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also  all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive  behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the  split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic  signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were  exposed to ATZ for 14days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2\%  acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000μg/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same  tank was recorded for 6min and biological samples were prepared. Our results  showed that 1000μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well  as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an  increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant  differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency  to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,  but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ  did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain.  Exposure to 10μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data  suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be  related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use  of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group  behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds.},

	abstract = {Nanoplastics are being detected with increasing frequency in aquatic environments. Although evidence suggests that nanoplastics can cause overt  toxicity to biota across different trophic levels, but there is little  understanding of how materials such as differently charged polystyrene  nanoplastics (PS-NP) impact fish development and behavior. Following exposure to  amino-modified (positive charge) PS-NP, fluorescence accumulation was observed in  the zebrafish brain and gastrointestinal tract. Positively charged PS-NP induced  stronger developmental toxicity (decreased spontaneous movement, heartbeat,  hatching rate, and length) and cell apoptosis in the brain and induced greater  neurobehavioral impairment as compared to carboxyl-modified (negative charge)  PS-NP. These findings correlated well with fluorescence differences indicating  PS-NP presence. Targeted neuro-metabolite analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS reveals that  positively charged PS-NP decreased levels of glycine, cysteine, glutathione, and  glutamic acid, while the increased levels of spermine, spermidine, and tyramine  were induced by negatively charged PS-NP. Positively charged PS-NP interacted  with the neurotransmitter receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NMDA2B),  whereas negatively charged PS-NP impacted the G-protein-coupled receptor 1  (GPR1), each with different binding energies that led to behavioral differences.  These findings reveal the charge-specific toxicity of nanoplastics to fish and  provide new perspective for understanding PS-NP neurotoxicity that is needed to  accurately assess potential environmental and health risks of these emerging  contaminants.},

This  study examined the effects of clethodim on zebrafish at aspects of early stage  embryonic development, immune toxicity, cell apoptosis and locomotor behavior.  Firstly, clethodim exposure markedly decreased the survival rate, body length,  and heart rate and resulted in a series of morphological abnormalities, primarily  spinal deformities (SD) and yolk sac edema, in zebrafish larvae. Secondly, the  number of immune cells was substantially reduced but the levels of apoptosis and  oxidative stress were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon  clethodim exposure. Thirdly, we evaluated the expression of some key genes in TLR  signaling including TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 and they were all up-regulated by  exposure to 300 μg/L clethodim. Meanwhile, some proinflammatory cytokines such as  TNF-α, IL-1β, IL8, and IFN-γ were also activated in both the mock and the TLR4-KD  conditions. Moreover, the locomotor behaviors and the enzymatic activities of  AChE were obviously inhibited but the levels of acetylated histone H3 were  greatly increased by clethodim exposure. In addition, incubation of zebrafish  larvae with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol can partially rescue  the clethodim-modulated locomotor behavior. Taken together, our results suggest  that clethodim has the potential to induce developmental immunotoxicity and cause  behavioral alterations in zebrafish larvae. The information presented in this  study will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying clethodim  exposure in aquatic ecosystems.},

It has been established that  both A-Phen and DP elicit neurotoxicity, but the potential interactive toxicity  of these contaminants is not well-known. To determine whether a mixture of A-Phen  and DP would exhibit interactive effects on neurodevelopment, we co-exposed  3-methylphenanthrene (3-MP), a representative of A-Phen, with DP. Our results  illustrated that exposure to 5 or 20 μg/L 3-MP alone or in combination with  60 μg/L DP caused neurobehavioral anomalies in zebrafish. In accordance with the  behavioral deficits, 3-MP alone or co-exposed with DP significantly decreased  axonal growth of secondary motoneurons, altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis  and induced cell apoptosis in the muscle of zebrafish. Additionally, 3-MP alone  or co-exposed with DP significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and  the mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes. These findings indicate that 3-MP  alone or co-exposed with DP induces neurobehavioral deficits through the combined  effects on neuronal connectivity and muscle function. Chemical analysis revealed  significant increases in 3-MP and DP bioaccumulation in zebrafish co-exposed with  3-MP and DP. Elevated bioaccumulation resulting from mixture exposure may  represent a significant contribution of the synergistic effects observed in  combined chemical exposure.},

	abstract = {Altered transcription of calcium-dependent signaling cascades involving the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in response  to environmental exposures have been described in model vertebrates, including  zebrafish, while the relevance for wild fishes remains unknown. To address this  knowledge gap, we exposed the euryhaline model species Menidia beryllina (inland  silversides) to the insecticide bifenthrin, a known modulator of calcium  signaling. The main objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether  exposure of developing silversides to environmentally relevant concentrations of  bifenthrin alters their behavior; and (2) whether behavioral changes correlate  with altered expression of genes involved in RyR and mTOR-dependent signaling  pathways. At six hours post fertilization (hpf), inland silversides were exposed  to bifenthrin at 3, 27 and 122 ng/L until 7 days post fertilization (dpf, larvae  hatched at 6dpf), followed by a 14-day recovery period in uncontaminated water.  Transcriptional responses were measured at 5, 7 and 21 dpf; locomotor behavior  following external stimuli and response to an olfactory predator cue were  assessed at 7 and 21 dpf. Bifenthrin elicited significant non-monotonic  transcriptional responses in the majority of genes examined at 5 dpf and at 21  dpf. Bifenthrin also significantly altered predator avoidance behavior via  olfactory mechanisms with main effects identified for animals exposed to 3 and  27 ng/L. Behavioral effects were not detected in response to visual stimuli  during acute exposure, but were significant in the predator-cue assessment  following the recovery period, suggesting delayed and long-term effects of early  developmental exposures to bifenthrin. Our findings demonstrate that at picomolar  (pM) concentrations, which are often not represented in ecotoxicological studies,  bifenthrin perturbs early development of inland silversides. These developmental  impacts are manifested behaviorally at later life stages, specifically as altered  patterns of predator avoidance behavior, which have been correlated with  population decline. Collectively, these data suggest that bifenthrin may be  negatively impacting wild fish populations.},

In this study, adult zebrafish were used to study the  enantioselective bioaccumulation of HEX and its effect endpoints in liver,  including oxidative stress and the regulation of apoptosis-related gene  expression. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was demonstrated when  exposed to HEX of 100 and 200 μg L(-)(1), finding that the (-)-enantiomer tended  to accumulate in zebrafish more easily than (+)-enantiomer. Activities of  antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and GSH content were all significantly  decreased when zebrafish were exposed to 50 and 200 μg L(-1) HEX for 21 d. A  series of genes of the apoptosis pathway were examined in groups treated with 50  and 200 μg L(-)(1) HEX for 21 d using real-time PCR. Significant up-regulation of  p53, Puma, Apaf-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression and down-regulation of  Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio were proved. The overall results indicated that  waterborne HEX was able to produce oxidative stress and induce apoptosis through  the involvement of caspases in adult zebrafish.

OP poisoning induces cholinergic syndrome, with respiratory distress,  hypertension, and neuron damage that may lead to epileptic seizures and permanent  cognitive deficits. Existing countermeasures are lifesaving but do not prevent  long-lasting neuronal comorbidities, emphasizing the urgent need for animal  models to better understand OP neurotoxicity and identify novel antidotes. Here,  using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a prototypic and moderately toxic OP,  combined with zebrafish larvae, we first showed that DFP poisoning caused major  acetylcholinesterase inhibition, resulting in paralysis and CNS neuron  hyperactivation, as indicated by increased neuronal calcium transients and  overexpression of the immediate early genes fosab, junBa, npas4b, and atf3. In  addition to these epileptiform seizure-like events, DFP-exposed larvae showed  increased neuronal apoptosis, which were both partially alleviated by diazepam  treatment, suggesting a causal link between neuronal hyperexcitation and cell  death. Last, DFP poisoning induced an altered balance of glutamatergic/GABAergic  synaptic activity with increased NR2B-NMDA receptor accumulation combined with  decreased GAD65/67 and gephyrin protein accumulation. The zebrafish DFP model  presented here thus provides important novel insights into the pathophysiology of  OP intoxication, making it a promising model to identify novel antidotes.},

Likely due to its wide-spread  use, IMZ is frequently detected in vegetable, fruit, soil and even surface water  samples. Even though several previous studies have reported on the neurotoxicity  of IMZ, its effects on the neurobehavior of zebrafish have received little  attention to date. In this study, we show that the heartbeat and hatchability of  zebrafish were significantly influenced by IMZ concentrations of 300 μg L(-1) or  higher. Moreover, in zebrafish larvae, locomotor behaviors such as average  swimming speed and swimming distance were significantly decreased after exposure  to 300 μg L(-1) IMZ for 96 h, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression and  activity were consistently inhibited in IMZ-treated fish. Our results further  suggest that IMZ could act as a neuroendocrine disruptor by decreasing the  expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as Glial fibrillary acidic protein  (Gfap), Myelin basic protein (Mbp) and Sonic hedgehog a (Shha) during early  developmental stages of zebrafish. In conclusion, we show that exposure to IMZ  has the potential to induce developmental toxicity and locomotor behavior  abnormalities during zebrafish development.},

Damage effects to nontarget organisms have been reported, particularly  in the early stages of development. Studies indicate redox unbalance as secondary  PM effect. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the acute PM effects on larval  zebrafish. Larvae (6 days postfertilization) were exposed to PM (25-600 μg/L)  during 24 hours, and 50\% lethal concentration was estimated. For subsequent  assays, the sublethal PM concentrations of 25 and 50 μg/L were used. PM increased  anxiety-like behaviors according to the Novel Tank and Light-Dark tests. At the  molecular level, PM induced increased ROS, which may be related to the increased  lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis detected in PM-exposed organisms.  In parallel, upregulation of the antioxidant system was detected after PM  exposure, with increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and  glutathione reductase activities, and thiol levels. The increased of Nrf2 target  genes and the activation of an electrophile response element-driven reporter  Tg(EPRE:LUC-EGFP) suggest that the Nrf2 pathway can mediate a fast response to  PM, leading to antioxidant amplification. By using high-resolution respirometry,  we found that exposure to PM decreased the oxygen consumption in all respiratory  stages, disrupting the oxidative phosphorylation and inhibiting the electron  transfer system, leading to decrease in bioenergetics capacity. In addition, PM  led to increases of residual oxygen consumption and changes in substrate control  ratio. Glucose metabolism seems to be affected by PM, with increased lactate  dehydrogenase and decreased citrate synthase activities. Taken together, our  results demonstrated the adverse effects of acute sublethal PM concentrations  during larval development in zebrafish, causing apparent mitochondrial  dysfunction, indicating a potential mechanism to redox unbalance and oxidative  stress, which may be linked to the detected cell death and alterations in normal  behavior patterns caused by acute PM exposure.},

The results  showed that high concentration of PCM could cause the pericardial edema and  increase the heart rates in larval zebrafish, suggesting that PCM had  developmental toxicity to zebrafish. We also observed that PCM exposure not only  changed the physiological parameters including TBA, GLU and pyruvic acid, but  also changed the transcriptional levels of glycolipid metabolism related genes.  In addition, after transcriptomics analysis, a total of 1065 differentially  expressed genes, including 456 up-regulated genes and 609 down-regulated genes,  changed significantly in 100 μg/L PCM treated larval zebrafish. Interestingly,  after GO (Gene Ontology) analysis, the different expression genes (DEGs) were  mainly enriched to the three different biology processes including GABA-nervous,  lipid Metabolism and response to drug. We also observed that the levels of GABA  receptor related genes including gabrg2, gabbr1α, gabbr1 and gabra6α were  inhibited by PCM exposure. Interestingly, the swimming distance of larval  zebrafish had the tendency to decrease after PCM exposure, indicating that the  nervous system was affected by PCM. Taken together, the results confirmed that  the fungicide PCM could cause developmental toxicity by influencing the lipid  metabolism and GABA mediated nervous system and behavior in larval zebrafish.

Herein, we investigated the metabolism  of six typical organophosphate (OP) flame retardants (tripropyl phosphate (TPRP),  tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP),  tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate  (TDCIPP) and tri-p-cresyl phosphate (p-TCP)) in adult zebrafish in laboratory at  three levels (0, 1/150 LC(50) (environmentally relevant level), and 1/30 LC(50)  per OP analog). Twenty main metabolites were detected in the liver of OPs-exposed  zebrafish using high resolution mass spectrometry (Q-TOF). The reaction pathways  involving scission of the ester bond (hydrolysis), cleavage of the ether bond,  oxidative hydroxylation, dechlorination, and coupling with glucuronic acid were  proposed, and were further confirmed by the frontier electron density and point  charge calculations. Tissue distribution of the twenty metabolites revealed that  liver and intestine with the highest levels of metabolites were the most active  organs for OPs biotransformation among the studied tissues of intestine, liver,  roe, brain, muscle, and gill, which showed the importance of hepatobiliary system  (liver-bile-intestine) in the metabolism and excretion of OPs in zebrafish. Fast  depuration of metabolites from tissues indicated that the formed metabolites  might be not persistent in fish, and easily released into water. This study  provides comprehensive information on the metabolism of OPs in the tissue of  zebrafish, which might give some hints for the exploration of their toxic  mechanism in aquatic life.},

	abstract = {Fipronil, a broad-spectrum chiral insecticide, has been documented to induce significant neurotoxicity to nontarget aquatic species; however, whether its  neurotoxicity behaves enantioselectively and what molecular mechanisms correspond  to the neurotoxicity remain unanswered. To date, few investigations have focused  on the genomic mechanisms responsible for the enantioselective toxicity of chiral  pesticides. The epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, caused by  the pesticides are also blind spot of the research works. Video tracking showed  that R-fipronil exhibited more intense neurotoxicity, as well as the induction of  more severe anxiety-like behavior, such as boosted swimming speed and  dysregulated photoperiodic locomotion, to embryonic and larval zebrafish compared  with S-fipronil. The MeDIP-Seq analysis, combined with Gene Ontology and KEGG,  revealed that R-fipronil disrupted five signaling pathways (MAPK, Calcium  signaling, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Purine metabolism, and  Endocytosis) to a greater extent than S-fipronil through the hypermethylation of  several important neuro-related genes, whereas no significant alterations of  global DNA methylation were observed on the two enantiomers. To summarize, our  data indicated that the fipronil-conducted enantioselective neurotoxicity likely  applied its enantioselectivity by the dysregulation of DNA methylation. Our study  also provided novel epigenetic insights into the study of enantioselective  biological effects and the relevant underlying mechanisms of chiral insecticide.},

Previous studies have  investigated the influences of cyprodinil on the developmental and reproductive  toxicity of fish. However, it remains unknown whether it affects fish behaviors  and the underlying mechanisms. In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model  animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to  240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration)  and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was  significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator  behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the  adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol  homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 μg/L).  In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland  axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were  downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the  hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells  increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover,  these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of  zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator  behavior during the predator avoidance test. Overall, the data provided herein  further our understanding of cyprodinil toxicity and can be used to assess the  ecological effects of cyprodinil on the induction of abnormal behaviors at the  environmental level.},

Despite  previous researches have reported the developmental toxicity of TBOEP in  zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, few research focused on its underlying  mechanisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 20, 200, 1000 and  2000 µg/L TBOEP from 2 until 120 h post-fertilization (hpf) to determine  potential mechanisms of developmental toxicity of this compound. Early  developmental stage parameters such as body length, survival rate, hatching rate  and heart rate were decreased, while malformation rate was ascended. Quantitative  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was carried out  at 12, 24, 72 and 120 hpf to demonstrate alterations in expression of genes of  Wnt signaling pathway. The results indicated that axin1 was significantly  up-regulated, while β-catenin, pkc and wnt11 were down-regulated. Correlation  analysis indicated that expression of these genes was significantly correlated  with body length. Furthermore, apoptosis was detected in heart region by acridine  orange (AO) staining and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP  nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In addition, at 120 hpf, occurrence of oxidative  stress was observed in zebrafish larvae. Moreover, 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime  (BIO)， an activator of Wnt pathway, was found to alleviate the inhibiting effects  of TBOEP on zebrafish growth. The overall outcomes offered novel viewpoints in  toxic effects of TBOEP, and down-regulating Wnt signaling pathway were able to  reveal some potential mechanisms of developmental toxicity of TBOEP in zebrafish  larvae.},

	abstract = {Surface engineering of nanocarriers allows fine-tuning of their interactions with biological organisms, potentially forming the basis of devices for the monitoring  of intracellular events or for intracellular drug delivery. In this context,  biodegradable nanocarriers or nanocapsules capable of carrying bioactive  molecules or drugs into the mitochondrial matrix could offer new capabilities in  treating mitochondrial diseases. Nanocapsules with a polymeric backbone that  undergoes programmed rupture in response to a specific chemical or enzymatic  stimulus with subsequent release of the bioactive molecule or drug at  mitochondria would be particularly attractive for this function. With this goal  in mind, we have developed biologically benign nanocapsules using  polyurethane-based, polymeric backbone that incorporates repetitive ester  functionalities. The resulting nanocapsules are found to be highly stable and  monodispersed in size. Importantly, a new non-isocyanate route is adapted for the  synthesis of these non-isocyanate polyurethane nanocapsules (NIPU). The embedded  ester linkages of these capsules' shells have facilitated complete degradation of  the polymeric backbone in response to a stimulus provided by an esterase enzyme.  Hydrophilic payloads like rhodamine or doxorubicin can be loaded inside these  nanocarriers during their synthesis by an interfacial polymerization reaction.  The postgrafting of the nanocapsules with phosphonium ion, a  mitochondria-targeting receptor functionality, has helped us achieve the  site-specific release of the drug. Co-localization experiments with commercial  mitotracker green as well as mitotracker deep red confirmed localization of the  cargo in mitochondria. Our in vitro studies confirm that specific release of  doxorubicin within mitochondria causes higher cytotoxicity and cell death  compared to free doxorubicin. Endogenous enzyme triggered nanocapsule rupture and  release of the encapsulated dye is also demonstrated in a zebrafish model. The  results of this proof-of-concept study illustrate that NIPU nanocarriers can  provide a site-specific delivery vehicle and improve the therapeutic efficacy of  a drug or be used to produce organelle-specific imaging studies.},

GLY is applied in formulated products known as  glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), which could induce effects that are not  predicted by toxicity assays with pure GLY. This herbicide is classified as  organophosphorus compound, which is known to induce neurotoxic effects. Although  this compound is classified as non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies, acute  exposure to GBH causes neurological symptoms in humans. However, there is no  consensus in relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH. Thus, the aim of this study  was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of the GBH in the zebrafish Danio  rerio, focusing on acute toxicity, the activity and transcript levels of  mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane potential,  reactive species (RS) formation, and behavioral repertoire. Adult zebrafish were  exposed in vivo to three concentrations of GBH Scout(®), which contained GLY in  formulation (fGLY) (0.065, 1.0 and 10.0 mg L(-1) fGLY) for 7 d, and an in vitro  assay was performed using also pure GLY. Our results show that GBH induced in  zebrafish brain a decrease in cell viability, inhibited mitochondrial complex  enzymatic activity, modulated gene expression related to mitochondrial complexes,  induced an increase in RS production, promoted hyperpolarization of mitochondrial  membrane, and induced behavioral impairments. Together, our data contributes to  the knowledge of the neurotoxic effects of GBH. Mitochondrial dysfunction has  been recognized as a relevant cellular response that should not be disregarded.  Moreover, this study pointed to the mitochondria as an important target of GBH.},

Behavior activity  suggested a possibility of reviving circadian rhythm in test organisms after  exposure to the chemical in lower concentration (0.1 TU). This type of rhythm  disappeared in higher concentrations (1.0 TU and 2.0 TU).

Overall, 37 known  zebrafish miRNAs were differentially expressed in the infection group and 107  predicted target genes of 26 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the mRNA  transcriptome.

This study further investigates ATZ-related developmental toxicity  by testing the following hypotheses in zebrafish: the effects of embryonic ATZ  exposure are dependent on timing of exposure; embryonic ATZ exposure alters brain  development and function; and embryonic ATZ exposure changes protein abundance in  carcinogenesis-related pathways. After exposing embryos to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts  per billion (ppb) ATZ, we monitored the expression of cytochrome P450 family 17  subfamily A member 1 (cyp17a1), glyoxalase I (glo1), ring finger protein 14  (rnf14), salt inducible kinase 2 (sik2), tetratricopeptide domain 3 (ttc3), and  tumor protein D52 like 1 (tpd52l1) at multiple embryonic time points to determine  normal expression and if ATZ exposure altered expression. Only cyp17a1 had normal  dynamic expression, but ttc3 and tpd52l1 had ATZ-related expression changes  before 72 h. Larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had increased brain length, while  larvae exposed to 30 ppb ATZ were hypoactive. Proteomic analysis identified  altered protein abundance in pathways related to cellular function,  neurodevelopment, and genital-tract cancer. The results indicate embryonic ATZ  toxicity involves interactions of multiple pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the  first report of proteomic alterations following embryonic exposure to atrazine,  an environmentally persistent pesticide and common water contaminant. Although  the transcriptomic alterations in larval zebrafish with embryonic atrazine  exposure have been reported, neither the time at which gene expression changes  occur nor the resulting proteomic changes have been investigated. This study  seeks to address these knowledge gaps by evaluating atrazine's effect on gene  expression through multiple time points during embryogenesis, and correlating  changes in gene expression to pathological alterations in brain length and  functional changes in behavior. Finally, pathway analysis of the proteomic  alterations identifies connections between the molecular changes and functional  outcomes associated with embryonic atrazine exposure.},

Whole extracts induced toxicity including mortality, edema, and notochord  distortion at 20\% effect concentration (EC20) values of approximately 100, 100,  and 10 mg LDPE/mL, respectively. Through fractionation, we determined that PAHs  at concentrations similar to previous research did not contribute markedly to  toxicity. We also eliminated pesticides, phthalates, musks, and other substances  identified in toxic fractions by testing surrogate mixtures. We identified free  fatty acids as lethal components of LDPE extracts and confirmed their toxicity  with authentic standards. We found chromatographic evidence that dithiocarbamates  are responsible for notochord and other sublethal effects, although exact matches  were not obtained.

At sufficiently high concentrations or within mixtures, they could provoke neurotoxic effects and  neurological diseases to organisms and humans. Fast identification of such  neuroactive compounds in the environment could help in hazard assessment and risk  mitigation. Behavior change is considered as an important endpoint and might be  directly or indirectly connected to a neuroactive mode of action. For a fast  evaluation of environmental samples and pure substances, we optimized the  measurement of a behavioral endpoint in zebrafish embryos - the spontaneous tail  coiling (STC). Evaluation of results is automated via the use of a workflow  established with the KNIME® software. Analysis duration and developmental stage  were optimized to 1 min and 25 ± 1 hpf respectively during measurement. Exposing  the embryos in a group of 10 or 20 and acclimatizing for 30 min at room  temperature proved to be reliable. The optimized method was used to investigate  neurotoxic effects of 18 substances with different modes of action (MoA). The STC  test accurately detected the effect of 8 out of 11 neuroactive substances  (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon, paraoxon-methyl, abamectin,  carbamazepine, propafenone and diazepam). Aldicarb and nicotine showed subtle  effects which were considered to be conditional and imidacloprid showed no  effect. For substances with unknown neuroactive MoA, 3 substances did not provoke  any effect on the STC (pyraclostrobin, diuron and daunorubicin-hydrochloride)  while 4 other substances provoked an increased STC (hexaconazole, aniline,  dimethyl-sulfoxide and 3,4-dichloroaniline). Such unexpected effects indicate  possible neuroactive side effects or unknown mechanisms of action that impact on  the STC. In conclusion, the optimized STC parameters and the automated analysis  in KNIME® indicate opportunities for the harmonization of the STC test and  further development for prospective and diagnostic testing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fetal poisoning of California sea lions (CSLs; Zalophus californianus) has been associated with exposure to the algal toxin domoic acid.  These same sea lions accumulate a mixture of persistent environmental  contaminants including pesticides and industrial products such as polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Developmental  exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its stable  metabolite 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p -DDE) has been shown  to enhance domoic acid-induced seizures in zebrafish; however, the contribution  of other co-occurring contaminants is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We formulated a mixture  of contaminants to include PCBs, PBDEs, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and  chlordane at levels matching those reported for fetal CSL blubber to determine  the impact of co-occurring persistent contaminants with p,p -DDE on chemically  induced seizures in zebrafish as a model for the CSLs. METHODS: Embryos were  exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to p,p -DDE in the presence or absence of a  defined contaminant mixture prior to neurodevelopment via either bath exposure or  embryo yolk sac microinjection. After brain maturation (7 days  postfertilization), fish were exposed to a chemical convulsant, either  pentylenetetrazole or domoic acid; resulting seizure behavior was then monitored  and analyzed for changes, using cameras and behavioral tracking software.  RESULTS: Induced seizure behavior did not differ significantly between subjects  with embryonic exposure to a contaminant mixture and those exposed to p,p -DDE  only. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that p,p -DDE--in the absence of  PCBs, HCH, chlordane, and PBDEs that co-occur in fetal sea lions--accounts for  the synergistic activity that leads to greater sensitivity to domoic acid  seizures.},

The effects of these exposures on embryonic  morphology, larval behavior and antioxidant gene expression were analyzed.  Phenotypic analysis at 48 hpf showed that ESF led to a dose-dependent increase in  embryonic deformities, including axis malformations, pericardial edema and  reduced pigmentation. Co-exposure of ESF with α-TOC (1-3 mM) significantly  (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced ESF-induced embryonic malformations. Exposure to solely α-TOC  did not affect rates of survival or malformations. Behavior studies showed that  ESF caused hyperactivity at 5 days post fertilization, indicating a developmental  neurotoxic effect. The ESF-induced hyperactivity was ameliorated by α-TOC.  Elevated ESF concentrations caused down-regulation of the antioxidant genes  cuzn-sod, gpx1a and cat, suggesting that ESF promoted oxidative stress in the  embryos. α-TOC did not prevent the ESF-induced dysregulation of these genes.  These results demonstrate that α-TOC protects against phenotypic and behavioral  effects caused by ESF but did not rescue ESF-induced aberrations in antioxidant  gene expression.},

Microcapsulation can address the inherent limitation of  pyraclostrobin that is photo unstable and highly toxic on aquatic organisms.  Compared to free pyraclostrobin, microcapsulation could dramatically improve its  photostability under ultraviolet light irradiation. Lower acute toxicity against  zebra fish on the first day and gradually similar toxicity over time with that of  pyraclostrobin technical concentrate were in accordance with the release profiles  of pyraclostrobin microcapsules.

	abstract = {Endosulfan is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide that is still widely in use in many developing countries. Following application, endosulfan can get to  watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the  non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the  activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently  used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results  concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim  of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE  activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as  an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in  different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory  formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 μg endosulfan/L group  presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 ± 1.038 μmol SCh h(-1) mg  protein(-1); p=0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 ± 1.768 μmol SCh  h(-1) mg protein(-1); p=0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40\%. The  down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the  transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results  reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in  brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 μg endosulfan/L during 96 h  impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (≈21\%,  273.7 ± 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 ±  21.30, p=0.0483), traveled distance (≈20\%, 23.44 ± 2.127 m compared to the  control group 29.39 ± 1.585, p=0.0281), mean speed (≈25\%, 0.03 ± 0.003 m/s  compared to the control group 0.04 ± 0.002, p=0.0275) and body turn angle (≈21\%,  69,940 ± 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88,010 ± 4560,  p=0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs  animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological  and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan  exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance  apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of  endosulfan exposure in the nervous system.},

To assess the health risk of  PQ, especially to suicidal individuals, accidental ingestion eaters, occupational  groups, and special multitude, firstly we explored the acute toxic effect and the  possible mechanisms of high-level exposure of PQ using zebrafish. The mainly  target organs of PQ were swim bladder which is the homolog of the mammalian lung,  followed by gastrointestinal tract and liver. Morphological malformations which  were further defined by histopathologic examination include smaller size,  fibrosis and inflammatory cell invasion for swim bladder; irregularly arranged or  dissolved epithelial folds, loss of villous architecture, and ecclasis of mucosal  cells in a smaller lumen for gastrointestinal tract; as well as smaller size,  degeneration, fibrous proliferation, atrophy for liver. In addition, PQ enhanced  leukocyte recruitment (neutrophil migrated first, followed by macrophage) into  swim bladder and induced ROS which can be scavenged by glutathione. Moreover,  qRT-PCR results showed that PQ increased the expression level of genes involved  in the inflammatory response, such as L-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TNF-β, IFN-1,  TGF-β, and NF-kB. For the first time, our results demonstrated that acute  exposure of PQ induced pulmonary toxicity which was followed by gastrointestinal  and hepatic toxicity via neutrophil-mediated ROS in zebrafish. In summary, these  findings generated here will contribute to our better understanding of  characteristics of PQ acute poisoning and can provide valuable information on  better PQ poisoning treatments, occupational disease prevention, and providing  theoretical foundation for risk management measures.},

Since it crosses placental barrier it can induce warfarin embryopathy (WE), a fetal  mortality in neonates characterized by skeletal deformities in addition to brain  hemorrhages. Although the effects of warfarin exposure in aquatic off target  species were already described, the particular molecular toxicological mechanisms  during early development are still unclear. Here, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio)  to describe and compare the developmental effects of warfarin exposure (0, 15.13,  75.68 and 378.43 mM) on two distinct early developmental phases (embryos and  eleuthero-embryos). Although exposure to both developmental phases induced fish  mortality, only embryos exposed to the highest warfarin level exhibited features  mimicking mammalian WE, e.g. high mortality, higher incidence of hemorrhages and  altered skeletal development, among other effects. To gain insights into the  toxic mechanisms underlying warfarin exposure, the transcriptome of embryos  exposed to warfarin was explored through RNA-Seq and compared to that of control  embryos. 766 differentially expressed (564 up- and 202 down-regulated) genes were  identified. Gene Ontology analysis revealed particular cellular components  (cytoplasm, extracellular matrix, lysosome and vacuole), biological processes  (mainly amino acid and lipid metabolism and response to stimulus) and pathways  (oxidative stress response and apoptosis signaling pathways) being significantly  overrepresented in zebrafish embryos upon warfarin exposure. Protein-protein  interaction further evidenced an altered redox system, blood coagulation and  vasculogenesis, visual phototransduction and collagen formation upon warfarin  exposure. The present study not only describes for the first time the WE in  zebrafish, it provides new insights for a better risk assessment, and highlights  the need for programming the rat eradication actions outside the fish spawning  season to avoid an impact on off target fish community. The urge for the  development of more species-specific anticoagulants for rodent pest control is  also highlighted.},

It has been shown that IVM enters the aquatic compartment and  adversely affects organisms including fish. This study is based on the hypothesis  that long term exposure to IVM affects fish and thus, the main objective was to  assess the chronic effects of 0.25 and 25 µg IVM/L to zebrafish using multiple  endpoints representative of several levels of biological organization: weight,  behaviour (swimming and feeding) and subcellular markers including biomarkers for  oestrogenicity (vitellogenin-VTG), oxidative stress (catalase-CAT and  glutathione-S-transferase-GST) and neurotransmission (cholinesterase-ChE).  Concentrations as low as 0.25 µg IVM/L disrupted the swimming behaviour, causing  fish to spend more time at the bottom of aquaria. Such reduction of the swimming  performance affected the feeding ability which is likely responsible for the  weight loss. The effects on weight were gender differentiated, being more  pronounced in males (0.25 µg IVM/L) than in females (25 µg IVM/L). Fish exposed  to 25 µg/L exhibited darker coloration and mild curvature of the spine. No  effects on VTG and AChE were observed, but a reduction on CAT and GST levels was  observed in fish exposed to 25 µg IVM/L, although these alterations probably only  reflect the general condition of the fish which was significantly compromised at  this concentration. Despite that predicted environmental concentrations of IVM  are below 0.25 µg/L, the behavioural effects may be translated into important  ecological impacts, e.g. at predator-prey interactions where fish competitive  advantage can be decreased. Future work should address the link between behaviour  disruption and population fitness. The current study was based on a one  experiment and multiple endpoint (anchored) approach, allowing the results to be  integrated and linked towards a mechanistic understanding.},

Embryos exposed to fipronil at nominal  concentrations at or above 0.7 microM (333 mug/l) displayed notochord  degeneration, shortening along the rostral-caudal body axis, and ineffective tail  flips and uncoordinated muscle contractions along the body axis in response to  touch. This phenotype closely resembles zebrafish locomotor mutants of the  accordion class and is consistent with loss of reciprocal inhibitory  neurotransmission by glycinergic commissural interneurons in the spinal cord.  Consistent with the hypothesis that notochord degeneration may be due to abnormal  mechanical stress from muscle tetany, the expression patterns of gene and protein  markers specific to notochord development were unaffected by fipronil. Moreover,  the degenerative effects of fipronil (1.1 microM) were reversed by coexposure to  the sodium channel blocker MS-222 (0.6mM). The notochord effects of fipronil were  phenocopied by exposure to 70 microM strychnine, a glycinergic receptor  antagonist. In contrast, exposure to gabazine, a potent vertebrate GABA(A)  antagonist, resulted in a hyperactive touch response but did not cause notochord  degeneration. Although specifically developed to target insect GABA receptors  with low vertebrate toxicity, our results suggest that fipronil impairs the  development of spinal locomotor pathways in fish by inhibiting a structurally  related glycine receptor subtype. This represents an unanticipated and  potentially novel mechanism for fipronil toxicity in vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Various environmental contaminants are known agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is highly conserved across vertebrate species. Due to gene  duplication events before and after the divergence of ray- and lobe-finned  fishes, many teleosts have multiple AHR isoforms. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has  three identified AHRs: AHR1A and AHR1B, the roles of which are not yet well  elucidated, and AHR2, which has been shown to mediate the toxicity of various  anthropogenic compounds including dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, we sought to explore the  role of the two AHR1 isoforms in PAH- and PCB-induced toxicity in zebrafish  embryos utilizing morpholino gene knockdown of the AHR isoforms. Knockdown of  AHR1B did not affect the toxicity of PAH mixtures or PCB-126, whereas knockdown  of AHR1A exacerbated the cardiac toxicity caused by PAH mixtures and PCB-126.  Knockdown of AHR1A did not impact the mRNA expression of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and  CYP1C1 in exposed embryos, but it did result in increased CYP1 activity in  exposed embryos. As has been shown previously, knockdown of AHR2 resulted in  protection from PAH- and PCB-induced cardiac deformities and prevented CYP1  enzyme activity in exposed embryos. Co-knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 resulted in an  intermediate response compared to knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 individually;  co-knockdown did not exacerbate nor protect from PAH-induced deformities and  embryos exhibited an intermediate CYP1 enzyme activity response. In contrast,  co-knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 did protect from PCB-126-induced deformities.  These results suggest that AHR1A is not a nonfunctional receptor as previously  thought and may play a role in the normal physiology of zebrafish during  development and/or the toxicity of environmental contaminants in early life  stages.},

Chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, which is likely to affect  behaviour of the organism. NiCl2 targets the active sites of enzymes and is  regarded as an unspecific toxicant for aquatic organisms. Several endpoints, such  as locomotor activity, morphological abnormalities, and mortality of D. rerio  embryos and larvae were studied. During acute exposures to {\textgreater} or =0.25 mg/L of  chlorpyrifos, locomotor activity tended to increase. However, this activity  decreased significantly at {\textgreater} or =7.5 mg Ni/L. Subchronic exposures to CHP  resulted in behavioural changes at much lower concentrations ({\textgreater} or =0.01 mg/L)  and considerably earlier than the observed increase in morphological  abnormalities and mortality (LC(50) (10 d): 0.43 mg/L). Combined CHP and NiCl2  mixtures led to an antagonistic deviation from the concept of independent action,  in the case of locomotor activity. Compared to developmental or survival  parameters, behaviour was the most sensitive endpoint for CHP exposure in this  study; therefore we recommend this parameter to complement already established  endpoints.},

Cis-BF enantiomers exhibited the equal maternal transfer potentials.  GC/MSD analysis showed that parental 1S-cis-BF exposure could disrupt the  components of fatty acids in offspring embryos. In transcriptional expression,  the whole differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in GO  categories, including the processes related to lipid biosynthesis/metabolism. The  perturbations of fatty acids suggested that cis-BF has potential negative impacts  on embryos' development. Furthermore, enantioselective growth inhibition and  developmental neurotoxicity in larvae were also observed. The mRNA expressions of  neuronal development genes were significantly changed in 1S-exposed offspring, so  were the levels of the neurotransmitters and larval locomotion. Our results show  that the cis-BF induced the growth inhibition and neurotoxicity in zebrafish  larvae, which may be mediated by the development interference in embryos related  to the disrupted fatty acid composition. Furthermore, the toxicological response  to 1S-cis-BF was greater than that to the 1R-enantiomer in the offspring of  exposed adults.},

Considering  the structural similarity between OPFRs and organophosphate pesticides,  hypotheses that OPFRs may interfere with neurodevelopment as organophosphate  pesticides are reasonable. In this study, the neurotoxicity of three OPFRs,  including tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP)  and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), was evaluated in zebrafish larvae and  then compared with the neurotoxicity of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos  (CPF). The results showed that similar to CPF, exposure to OPFRs for 5days  resulted in significant changes in locomotor behavior, either in free swimming or  in photomotor response. However, given the transcriptional changes that occur in  nervous system genes in response to OPFRs and CPF, as well as the altered enzyme  activity of AChE and its mRNA level, the underlying mechanisms for neurotoxicity  among these organophosphate chemicals might be varied. In summary, the results  confirm the potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of OPFRs and underscore the  importance of identifying the mechanistic targets of the OPFRs with specific  moieties. Furthermore, as the neurobehavioral responses are well conserved among  vertebrates and the exposure of children to OPFRs is significant, a thorough  assessment of the risk of OPFRs exposure during early development should be  highly emphasized in future studies.},

Four hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were  exposed to several environmentally relevant concentrations of methamidophos (0,  25, and 500 μg/L) for up to 72 hpf. Locomotor behavior was then studied in the  zebrafish larvae at this timepoint. Acridine orange (AO) staining was carried out  in the zebrafish larvae, and the mRNA levels of genes associated with neural  development (mbp and syn2a) were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase  chain reaction (RT-PCR). The number of escape responders for mechanical  stimulation was significantly decreased in exposed groups. AO staining showed  noticeable signs of apoptosis mainly in the brain. In addition, the mRNA levels  of mbp and syn2a were both significantly down-regulated in exposed groups. Our  study provides the first evidence that methamidophos exposure can cause  developmental neurotoxicity in the early stages of zebrafish life, which may be  caused by the effect of methamidophos on neurodevelopmental genes and the  activation of cell apoptosis in the brain.},

The potential for OPFRs to cause  adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Because of their  structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been  heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated  the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate  (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to  behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the  organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. METHODS: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03  or 0.3 μM of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization.  Vehicle control consisted of 0.03\% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post  fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day  old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to  adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a  battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment  exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape.  RESULTS: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan.  Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 μM doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited  significant (p{\textless}0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate  exposure significantly (p{\textless}0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish  behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation  assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) reduced in fish  exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult  fish, with fish exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly  (p{\textless}0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. DISCUSSION:  Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that  persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader research investigating  the role of organophosphate compounds, including the OPFRs used here, in  developmental neurotoxicity.},

They are of significant  clinical importance as antifungal drugs and are widely used in personal care  products, ultraviolet stabilizers, and in aircraft for its anti-corrosive  properties. The prevalence of azole compounds in the natural environment and its  accumulation in fish raises questions about its impact on aquatic organisms.  OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to review the scientific studies on  the effects of azole compounds in fish and to discuss future opportunities for  the risk evaluation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on Web  of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to locate peer-reviewed scientific articles  on occurrence, environmental fate, and toxicological impact of azole fungicides  on fish. RESULTS: Studies included in this review provide ample evidence that  azole compounds are not only commonly detected in the natural environment but  also cause several detrimental effects on fish. Future studies with  environmentally relevant concentrations of azole alone or in combination with  other commonly occurring contaminants in a multigenerational study could provide  a better understanding. CONCLUSION: Based on current knowledge and studies  reporting adverse biological effects of azole on fish, considerable attention is  required for better management and effective ecological risk assessment of these  emerging contaminants.},

The current vector control strategies are limited due to multiple  insecticide resistance, deleterious impacts on the environment, and toxicity to  non-target organisms. Bilobol, an alkylresorcinol isolated from the plant species  Schinus terebinthifolia, demonstrated larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti  (LC(50) 7.67 mg/L in less than 24 h). To ensure that bilobol presents a viable  alternative as an eco-friendly larvicide, this study aimed to explore the  degradation process and acute toxicity of this alkylresorcinol in zebrafish, a  non-target organism. A quantification method with validated parameters was  developed and used to evaluate bilobol degradation in water over time. The Fish  Embryo Toxicity (FET) test was applied to evaluate the acute toxicity of bilobol  together with its degradation derivates. Results demonstrated that bilobol  gradually degrades over time and almost completely disappears after 96 h, turning  into small aliphatic chains which are less toxic than bilobol in its fundamental  form. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that bilobol does not present  significant toxicity to zebrafish embryos nor does it show signs of persistence  in the environment. Additionally, bilobol can be found in high quantities not  only in S. terebinthifolia, but also in cashew nut industry waste. Thus, bilobol  constitutes an alternative environmentally friendly insecticide because it is not  persistent, has indications of low toxicity to non-target organisms and presents  a way to exploit massive quantities of material discarded by the food industry.},

The toxicity of these substances with different modes of action  (acetylcholine esterase inhibitor vs. polar narcosis) was tested for single  substances as well as in binary mixtures. To study effects on different  biological organisation levels (from the molecular up to the whole organism  level) the molecular stress response regarding Hsp70, the embryonic and larval  development and the locomotor activity were investigated as integrative  biomarkers. In single substance tests 3,4-dichloroaniline elicited deformations  at {\textgreater} or = 0.25 mg/l during the 11 days subchronic test, whereas locomotor  activity and mortality were impaired at {\textgreater} or = 0.5 mg/l.

	abstract = {3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) cause multiple adverse effects in organisms including animals and humans. Although PCB toxicities are linked to  oxidative damage in rodents, the mechanism in early life stages of zebrafish is  not clear. To explore the developmental toxicity mechanism of PCB126, three  paradigms (toxicological phenotypes, biochemical changes, and molecular changes)  were studied in 3-h postfertilization (hpf) zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  exposed to different PCB126 concentrations (0, 16, 32, 64, and 128 μg/L) until  168 hpf. Developmental malformations, including pericardial and yolk sac edema,  impaired lower jaw growth, spinal curvature, head edema and failure to inflate  the swim bladder were observed, some as early as 72 hpf. Mortality was not  apparent in early stages but significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner  from 144 hpf onward. A dose-dependent significant increase in malformation rate  was observed from 72 hpf onward with up to 100\% at 132 hpf in embryos exposed to  128 μg/L of PCB126. Higher doses of PCB126 significantly decreased the  copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-Sod), catalase (Cat), and glutathione  peroxidase (Gpx) enzyme activities at 96, 132 hpf, but markedly declined from  thereafter. PCB126 at 128 μg/L significantly increased the malondialdehyde  content at 72, 96, and 132 hpf. The transcriptional gene expression of  antioxidant enzymes Cat and Gpx was upregulated in embryos exposed to 64 μg/L of  PCB126 at 24 and 96 hpf. Sod1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was low in embryos exposed to  32 μg/L at 72 and 96 hpf but was induced in embryos exposed to 64 and 128 μg/L  doses at 132 hpf. Collectively, the results suggest oxidative stress as a major  factor in the induction of multiple developmental abnormalities in early life  stages of zebrafish exposed to PCB126. However, the relationship between the  antioxidant enzyme activity and the mRNA expression was not clear and the  potential reasons for this are discussed.},

Pesticides have an irreplaceable role in  agricultural production, which leads to their massive utilization and their  inevitably penetrate into the aquatic environment. However, limited information  is available regarding the impact of CNTs on the toxicity and enrichment of  chiral compounds to organisms. Using zebrafish as a model to study whether the  enantioselective bioaccumulation and oxidative stress of chiral pollutants may be  altered in the presence of MWCNTs. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation  was observed in zebrafish with the preferential accumulation of R-(-)-indoxacarb  during the 28-day bioaccumulation. The combined exposure of MWCNTs does not  affect the enantioselectivity of zebrafish bioaccumulation, but increase the  bioaccumulation amount of R-(-)-indoxacarb by 65\%. Moreover, the average  degradation half-life of indoxacarb enantiomers was 1.30 days. The indoxacarb  causes oxidative stress toxicity in zebrafish liver and exhibited  enantioselectivity, while the addition of MWCNTs did not significantly change the  enantioselectivity of oxidative stress toxicity of indoxacarb, but enhanced the  toxicity 20\% with increased MWCNTs concentrations. This study suggests that the  risk of the co-presence of nanomaterials and chiral pesticides in aquatic  environments should be taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {Forchlorfenuron (CPPU) has been used worldwide, to boost size and improve quality of various agricultural products. CPPU and its metabolites are persistent and  have been detected frequently in fruits, water, sediments, and organisms in  aquatic systems. Although the public became aware of CPPU through the exploding  watermelon scandal of 2011 in Zhenjiang, China, little was known of its potential  effects on the environment and wildlife. In this study, adverse effects of CPPU  on developmental angiogenesis and vasculature, which is vulnerable to insults of  persistent toxicants, were studied in vivo in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio).  Exposure to 10 mg CPPU/L impaired survival and hatching, while development was  hindered by exposure to 2.5 mg CPPU/L. Developing vascular structure, including  common cardinal veins (CCVs), intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and sub-intestinal  vessels (SIVs), were significantly restrained by exposure to CPPU, in a  dose-dependent manner. Also, CPPU caused disorganization of the cytoskeleton. In  human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), CPPU inhibited proliferation,  migration and formation of tubular-like structures in vitro. Results of Western  blot analyses revealed that exposure to CPPU increased phosphorylation of FLT-1,  but inhibited phosphorylation of FAK and its downstream MAPK pathway in HUVECs.  In summary, CPPU elicited developmental toxicity to the developing endothelial  system of zebrafish and HUVECs. This was do, at least in part due to inhibition  of the FAK/MAPK signaling pathway rather than direct interaction with the VEGF  receptor (VEGFR).},

The results showed that  n-TiO(2) alone did not affect thyroid hormones levels or transcriptions of  related genes. Exposure to PCP significantly decreased thyroid hormone thyroxine  (T4) content, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level and transcription of  thyroglobulin (tg), but significantly increased 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3)  level and upregulation of deiodinase 2 (dio2). In comparison, the co-exposure  with n-TiO(2) significantly reduced the content of T3 by depressing the potential  targets, tg and dio2. For neurotoxicity, the single and co-exposure resulted in  similar effects with significant downregulation of neurodevelopment-related genes  (ELAV like RNA Binding Protein 3, elavl3; Growth associated protein-43, gap43;  α-tubulin) and inhibited locomotor activity.

As behavior  (swimming activity) response is the first adjustment due to neurotoxic stress on  the fitness of fish. In this study, the quantified swimming activity of zebrafish  (Danio rerio) under IPPP and TPP exposure in an online monitoring system was  investigated to assess the neurotoxin effects under long-term exposure periods,  no swimming anomalies were observed in the control group. Whereas, in the OPFR  exposures ((treatment I: 5 μg/L and treatment II: 25 μg/L), a series of anomalies  were identified. Hyperactivity was shown in IPPP treatment I group (5 μg/L),  whereas zebrafish swimming activity was declined throughout the study period in  IPPP treatment II (25 μg/L), and TPP groups (5 μg/L and 25 μg/L) when compared to  the control group. Circadian rhythm was not affected in the present study. The  results of the present study indicated that the fitness of test individuals was a  valid biomarker for eco-toxicity assessment under unescapable conditions.  Hypoactivity of zebrafish signified the neurotoxic effects of IPPP and TPP. A  concentration based improvement in swimming activity was observed under recovery  conditions, which suggested that recovery capacity along with toxicity responses  could be a comprehensive non-invasive technique to assess the eco-toxicity of  waterborne chemicals.},

Therefore, the objective of this  work was to represent a realistic application scenario by evaluating the toxicity  of environmental relevant and higher concentrations of a commercial formulation  of MZ using zebrafish embryos. Following determination of the 96-h LC(50) value,  the embryos at the blastula stage ({\textasciitilde} 2 h post-fertilisation, hpf) were exposed to  0.5, 5, and 50 μg L(-1) of the active ingredient ({\textasciitilde} 40× lower than the 96-h  LC(50)). During the exposure period (96 h), lethal, sublethal, and teratogenic  parameters, as well as behaviour analysis, at 120 hpf, were assayed. Biochemical  parameters such as oxidative stress-linked enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD),  catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)),  reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and glutathione levels (GSH and GSSG), as  well as the activity of degradation (glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  carboxylesterase (CarE)), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), and  anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related enzymes, were  analysed at the end of the exposure period. Exposed embryos showed a marked  decrease in the hatching rate and many malformations (cardiac and yolk sac oedema  and spinal torsions), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration. A  dose-dependent decreased locomotor activity and a response to an aversive  stimulus, as well as a light-dark transition decline, were observed at  environmental relevant concentrations. Furthermore, the activities of SOD and GR  increased while the activity of GST, AChE, and MDA contents decreased. Taken  together, the involvement of mancozeb metabolites and the generation of ROS are  suggested as responsible for the developmental phenotypes. While further studies  are needed to fully support the hypothesis presented, the potential cumulative  effects of mancozeb-containing formulations and its metabolites could represent  an environmental risk which should not be disregarded.},

	abstract = {During early zebrafish embryogenesis, spontaneous tail contractions represent the first sign of locomotion and result from innervation of primary motoneuron axons  to target axial muscles. Based on a high-content screen, we previously  demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish embryos to abamectin--an avermectin  insecticide--from 5-25 hours post-fertilization (hpf) abolished spontaneous  activity in the absence of effects on survival and gross morphology. Therefore,  the objective of this study was to begin investigating the mechanism of  abamectin-induced hypoactivity in zebrafish. Similar to 384-well plates, static  exposure of embryos to abamectin from 5-25 hpf in glass beakers resulted in  elimination of activity at low micromolar concentrations. However, abamectin did  not affect neurite outgrowth from spinal motoneurons and, compared with exposure  from 5-25 hpf, embryos were equally susceptible to abamectin-induced hypoactivity  when exposures were initiated at 10 and 23 hpf. Moreover, immersion of  abamectin-exposed embryos in clean water resulted in complete recovery of  spontaneous activity relative to vehicle controls, suggesting that abamectin  reversibly activated ligand-gated chloride channels and inhibited  neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated embryos to vehicle or  non-toxic concentrations of fipronil or endosulfan--two insecticides that  antagonize the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor--from 5-23 hpf, and then  exposed embryos to vehicle or abamectin from 23-25 hpf. Interestingly, activity  levels within abamectin-exposed embryos pretreated with either antagonist were  similar to embryos exposed to vehicle alone. Using quantitative PCR and  phylogenetic analyses, we then confirmed the presence of GABA receptor α1 and β2  subunits at 5, 10, and 23 hpf, and demonstrated that zebrafish GABA receptor  subunits are homologous to mammalian GABA receptor subunits. Overall, our data  collectively suggest that abamectin induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity  within early zebrafish embryos, an effect that may be mediated through the GABA  receptor.},

We developed  a multifactorial zebrafish drug-screening platform combining Pink1 deficiency  with an environmental toxin to compromise mitochondrial function and trigger  dopaminergic neuron loss. Using a phenotypic screening strategy, we identified a  series of piperazine phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, which rescued  Pink1 deficiency by activating autophagy selectively in stressed zebrafish and  human cells. We show that trifluoperazine acts downstream of, or parallel to,  PINK1/PARKIN to stimulate transcription factor EB nuclear translocation and the  expression of autophagy-lysosomal target genes. These data suggest that  stress-dependent pharmacological reactivation of autophagy could prevent the loss  of vulnerable neurons to slow neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: California sea lions have a large body burden of organochlorine pesticides, and over the last decade they have also been subject to domoic acid  poisoning. Domoic acid poisoning, previously recognized in adult animals, is now  viewed as a major cause of prenatal mortality. The appearance of a chronic  juvenile domoic acid disease in the sea lions, characterized by behavioral  abnormalities and epilepsy, is consistent with early life poisoning and may be  potentiated by organochlorine burden. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the interactive  effect of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on neurodevelopment using a  zebrafish (Danio rerio) model for seizure behavior to examine the susceptibility  to domoic acid-induced seizures after completion of neurodevelopment. METHODS:  Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to either o,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE  (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) during neurodevelopment via a 0.1\% dimethyl  sulfoxide solution. These larval (7 days postfertilization) fish were then  exposed to either the seizure-inducing drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or domoic  acid; resulting seizure behavior was monitored and analyzed for changes using  cameras and behavioral tracking software. RESULTS: Embryonic exposure to DDTs  enhanced PTZ seizures and caused distinct and increased seizure behaviors to  domoic acid, most notably a type of head-shaking behavior. CONCLUSION: These  studies demonstrate that embryonic exposure to DDTs leads to asymptomatic animals  at completion of neurodevelopment with greater sensitivity to domoic acid-induced  seizures. The body burden levels of p,p'-DDE are close to the range recently  found in fetal California sea lions and suggest a potential interactive effect of  p,p'-DDE embryonic poisoning and domoic acid toxicity.},

	abstract = {This is the first systemic assessment of the stereoselectivity of etoxazole enantiomers. Etoxazole's stereoselective bioactivity was assessed against target  organisms ( Tetranychus urticae eggs and Tetranychus cinnabarinus eggs), and its  acute toxicity was assessed toward nontarget aquatic organisms ( Daphnia magna  and Danio rerio). Additionally, stereoselective elimination was investigated in  three species of fruits (grape and strawberry grown in a greenhouse and apple  grown in an open field) and in field soil. The ovicidal activity of (+)-(  S)-etoxazole against Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus cinnabarinus eggs was  about 16 and 24 times higher, respectively, than that of (-)-( R)-etoxazole.  Inconsistent order of etoxazole isomer toxicity was found toward different  aquatic organisms: (+)-( S)-etoxazole showed nearly 8.7 times higher acute  toxicity than (-)-( R)-etoxazole toward Daphnia magna, whereas (-)-( R)-etoxazole  was ∼4.5 times more toxic to Danio rerio than (+)-( S)-etoxazole. Stereoselective  degradation of etoxazole enantiomers showed significant variation in various  fruits and field soil. The (+)-( S)-etoxazole was preferentially dissipated in  grape and strawberry fruits grown under greenhouse condition, whereas (-)-(  R)-etoxazole degraded faster than its antipode in apple fruits and soils under  open-field condition. Overall, the stereoselectivity of etoxazole enantiomers  should be fully considered in comprehensive environmental health risk in future  work.},

Aclonifen is toxic to experimental animals, causing developmental abnormalities, decreased energy  production for survival, and impaired organogenesis. However, no studies have  reported the functional defects and toxicity caused by aclonifen in embryonic  development. We hypothesized that the mechanism underlying the toxicity of  several herbicides in various organisms involves mitochondrial dysfunction, which  subsequently promotes genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and acute organotoxicity. In  the present study, we demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction during  development results in decreased body length, delayed yolk sac absorption,  malformed spinal cord, disrupted brain and eye formation, and the activation of  apoptosis in zebrafish embryos. Aclonifen induced oxidative stress by elevating  the level of reactive oxygen species, causing mitochondrial damage. Likewise,  impaired embryonic vascularization can promote cardiovascular disorders. In this  study, we characterized the toxicity of aclonifen in a non-target organism. These  findings increase our understanding of the toxicological effects of herbicides in  unexpected environments.},

Co-exposure to NP (1 mg/L) and KCZ/FCZ (1 mg/L) for 96 h reduced the  hatching rate, survival rate, and heart rate and increased the malformation rate  and catalase activity. The bax/bcl2 ratio, an apoptosis indicator, was higher  after NP, KCZ, or FCZ treatment. However, the bax/bcl2 ratio after exposure to NP  + KCZ or NP + FCZ was much higher than that after single exposure. Overall, the  results indicated that NP aggravated the toxicity of azole by significantly  increasing the reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and altering the  expression of oxidative-stress- and apoptosis-related genes.

We used the  zebrafish model to examine the link between chemotactic signaling and lysosome  physiology in macrophages during mycobacterial infection and wound-induced  inflammation in vivo. Macrophages from zebrafish larvae carrying a mutation in a  chemokine receptor of the Cxcr3 family display upregulated expression of vesicle  trafficking and lysosomal genes and possess enlarged lysosomes that enhance  intracellular bacterial clearance. This increased microbicidal capacity is  phenocopied by inhibiting the lysosomal transcription factor EC, while its  overexpression counteracts the protective effect of chemokine receptor mutation.  Tracking macrophage migration in zebrafish revealed that lysosomes of chemokine  receptor mutants accumulate in the front half of cells, preventing macrophage  polarization during chemotaxis and reaching sites of inflammation. Our work shows  that chemotactic signaling affects the bactericidal properties and localization  during chemotaxis, key aspects of the inflammatory response.},

	abstract = {Chemical exposures in fish have been linked to loss of olfaction leading to an inability to detect predators and prey and decreased survival. However, the  mechanisms underlying olfactory neurotoxicity are not well characterized,  especially in environmental exposures which involve chemical mixtures. We used  zebrafish to characterize olfactory transcriptional responses by two model  olfactory inhibitors, the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mixtures of CPF with  the neurotoxic metal copper (Cu). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from  olfactory tissues of zebrafish exposed to CPF alone or to a mixture of CPF and  Cu. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis and  hierarchical clustering, whereas gene set analysis was used to identify  biological themes in the microarray data. Microarray results were confirmed by  real-time PCR on genes serving as potential biomarkers of olfactory injury. In  addition, we mined our previously published Cu-induced zebrafish olfactory  transcriptional response database (Tilton et al., 2008) for the purposes of  discriminating pathways of olfaction impacted by either the individual agents or  the CPF-Cu mixture transcriptional signatures. CPF exposure altered the  expression of gene pathways associated with cellular morphogenesis and odorant  binding, but not olfactory signal transduction, a known olfactory pathway for Cu.  The mixture profiles shared genes from the Cu and CPF datasets, whereas some  genes were altered only by the mixtures. The transcriptional signature of the  mixtures was more similar to that in zebrafish exposed to Cu alone than for CPF.  In conclusion, exposure to a mixture containing a common environmental metal and  pesticide causes a unique transcriptional signature that is heavily influenced by  the metal, even when organophosphate predominates.},

TCP has three  symmetric isomers, distinguished by the methyl group position on the aromatic  ring system. One of these isomers, tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCP), has been  reported for years as a neuropathic OP, targeting neuropathic target esterase  (NTE/PNPLA6), but its mode of toxic action had not been fully elucidated.  Zebrafish eleuthero-embryo and larva were used to characterize the differential  action of the TCP isomers. The symmetric isomers inhibited phenyl valerate  (PV)-NTE enzymatic activity in vivo with different IC50, while no effect was  observed on acetylcholinesterase activity. Moreover, the locomotor behavior was  also affected by tri-para-cresyl phosphate and tri-meta-cresyl phosphate, only  ToCP exposure led to locomotor hyperactivity lasting several hours, associated  with defects in the postural control system and an impaired phototactic response,  as revealed by the visual motor response test. The electric field pulse motor  response test demonstrated that a seizure-like, multiple C-bend-spaghetti  phenotype may be significantly induced by ToCP only, independently of any  inhibition of PV-NTE activity. Eleuthero-embryos exposed to picrotoxin, a known  gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor inhibitor, exhibited similar adverse  outcomes to ToCP exposure. Thus, our results demonstrated that the TCP mode of  toxic action was isomer specific and not initially related to modulation of  PV-NTE activity. Furthermore, it was suggested that the molecular events involved  were linked to an impairment of the balance between excitation and inhibition in  neuronal circuits.},

Exposure of embryos at 1 h  post fertilization (hpf) to 3-5 μM Cd or 30-100 μM PQ for 9 h induced a 2-3-fold  increase of oxidative stress, while a 6.5-fold increase of oxidative stress was  induced by 200 μM PQ. Real-time RT-PCR detected a down-regulated xeroderma  pigmentosum C (XPC) and an up-regulated UV-DDB2 gene expression in  mildly-stressed embryos, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene  expression increased with PQ exposure levels. NER of UV-damaged DNA was enhanced  in weakly oxidant-stressed embryos as shown by a transcription-based DNA repair  assay, yet repair activities of both UV and cisplatin-damaged DNA were inhibited  in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ. Band shift assay showed a suppression of  cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) binding activity in all stressed embryos. In  contrast, (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP) recognition activity was weakly stimulated  except in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ, revealing a link of NER capacity to 6-4PP  binding. Our results showed that Cd and PQ imposed similar inducing effects on  UV-DDB2 gene expression, NER of UV-damaged DNA and 6-4PP binding activity in  zebrafish embryo under low levels of oxidative stress and NER capacity could be  inhibited if the intensity of oxidative stress increased to a critical level.},

Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that  32 signals were considered as differential signals in zebrafish after the  exposure treatment of fipronil and its derivatives, including  phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs),  phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), fatty acids and so on.

Besides, the intensities of PC  signals in the liver samples of each group showed such a trend: mixed fiprole  exposed group {\textgreater} fipronil sulfone exposed group ≈ fipronil sulfide exposed group {\textgreater}  fipronil exposed group {\textgreater} fipronil desulfinyl exposed group {\textgreater} control group,  indicating that mixed exposure of fipronil and its derivatives exhibited more  significant metabolic disturbance in zebrafish.

Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side  effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this  work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate  (RoundUp® UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish  embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to  0, 1, 2 and 5 μg a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for  72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were  washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour  was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory  motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social  interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes  were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field.  The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social  interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations.  Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae  exposed to 5 μg a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an aversive  stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory-motor coordination  during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic  effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In  addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species  that should not be neglected.},

In this study, four stereoisomers of sulfoxaflor were  separated using HPLC, and the absolute configurations of three stereoisomers were  identified via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. First, the stability and  isomerization of the four enantiomers and rac-sulfoxaflor in water and seven  organic solvents were investigated. All enantiomers were extremely unstable in  water with isomerization rates above 20\%. The racemate did not isomerize in any  of the solutions and was stable in water (degradation rate less than 7\%).  Therefore, we studied the acute toxicity, enantioselective behavior, and  enzymatic activities of rac-sulfoxaflor in zebrafish. The bioaccumulation  experiment demonstrated that the bioconcentration of sulfoxaflor in zebrafish was  enantioselective, and the four enantiomers accumulated in zebrafish in the order  (+)-2S,3S-sulfoxaflor {\textgreater} (-)-2R,3R-sulfoxaflor {\textgreater} (+)-2R,3S-sulfoxaflor {\textgreater} (-)-2S,3R-sulfoxaflor.  The effect of rac-sulfoxaflor on the enzymatic activities of zebrafish showed  that superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities and  malondialdehyde content were significantly enhanced as compared to those in  control, whereas acetylcholinesterase was significantly reduced in the  sulfoxaflor exposure treatment (p {\textless} 0.05), indicating that sulfoxaflor caused  oxidative lesions and induced enzymatic activity in zebrafish. This study  provides important information on the enantioselective behavior and toxic effects  of sulfoxaflor, which can help assess the potential ecological risk of chiral  pesticides to aquatic organisms.},

Use of  genetically engineered Tg(cmlc:EGFP) allowed fluorescence observation during  heart development. PY interfered with normal heart development via upregulation  of the nppa gene responsible for the expression of natriuretic peptides. Heart  function was dramatically reduced as indicated by reduced heart rates. Increased  expression of the nppa gene was also seen in AZ-treated embryos. The expression  level of cyp24a1 was also up-regulated, while ugt1a1 and sult1st6 were  down-regulated after treatment of zebrafish embryos with AZ or PY.

Because of the  conservation of acetylcholinesterase between invertebrates and vertebrates, OPs  also can adversely affect nontarget species, such as aquatic and terrestrial  animals. This study used uniform conditions to analyze the morphological and  physiological effects caused by developmental exposure to 3 commonly used  OPs-chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, and diazinon-on 2 aquatic vertebrate species, Danio  rerio (zebrafish) and Xenopus laevis. Survival, locomotor activity, heart rate,  and gross anatomical abnormalities, including kyphosis and edema, were observed  over a 5-d period in response to OP concentrations ranging from 0 µM to 1000 µM.  Both zebrafish and Xenopus showed decreased survival for all 3 OPs at higher  concentrations. However, Xenopus showed higher mortality than zebrafish at lower  chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos concentrations. Both models showed a dose-dependent  decrease in heart rate and free-swimming larval activity in response to  chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. In addition, kyphosis and decreased spine length  were prominent in Xenopus in response to 10 µM of chlorpyrifos and 0.1 µM  dichlorvos. Although diazinon induced no effects on skeletal and cardiac motor  activity in either species, it did induce cardiac edemas in zebrafish.  Differences in the biological actions of OPs and their differential effects in  these 2 vertebrate models demonstrate the importance of using common protocols  and multiple models to evaluate the ecotoxicology of OPs.},

We show that at  non-lethal, equimolar concentrations, chlorpyrifos (CPF) is more effective at  equimolar concentrations than diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) in producing AChE  inhibition. As concentrations of DZN and PA are raised, lethality occurs before  they can produce the degree of AChE inhibition observed with CPF at 300 nM.

Relative toxicity was measured through transcriptional,  morphological, and behavioral end points in zebrafish and fathead minnow fry  exposed for 96 h to RDX concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 27.7 mg/L. Spinal  deformities and lethality occurred at 1.8 and 3.5 mg/L RDX respectively for  fathead minnow and at 13.8 and 27.7 mg/L for zebrafish, indicating that zebrafish  have an 8-fold greater tolerance for RDX than fathead minnow fry. The number and  magnitude of differentially expressed transcripts increased with increasing RDX  concentration for both species. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in  functions related to neurological disease, oxidative-stress, acute-phase  response, vitamin/mineral metabolism and skeletal/muscular disorders. Decreased  expression of collagen-coding transcripts were associated with spinal deformity  and likely involved in sensitivity to RDX. Our work provides a mechanistic  explanation for species-specific sensitivity to RDX where zebrafish responded at  lower concentrations with greater numbers of functions related to RDX tolerance  than fathead minnow. While the 10-fold interspecies uncertainty factor does  provide a reasonable cross-species estimate of toxicity in the present study, the  observation that the responses between ZF and FHM are markedly different does  initiate a call for concern regarding establishment of broad ecotoxicological  conclusions based on model species such as zebrafish.},

In this research,  difenoconazole (DIF) and tebuconazole (TEB) mixture exhibited additive effect on  the acute toxicity to zebrafish embryos. The transcriptomics and metabolomics  demonstrated DIF and TEB mixtures at aquatic life benchmark and environmental  concentration simultaneously influenced the lipid metabolism, arachidonic acid  metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism, but showed  diverse response patterns mediating the combined effects on zebrafish embryos  after 120 h exposure. The DIF and TEB mixture at aquatic life benchmark caused  combined effect on yolk sac resorption and metabolites, was less than the  additive effect of individual DIF and TEB. It was found environmental  concentration of DIF and TEB caused much lower levels of IFN and IL6, induced  higher levels of PGE(2), l-kynurenine and formylanthranilate in zebrafish larvae,  and their binary mixture caused synergistic effect on the accumulation of  metabolites in metabolic pathways, which might cause more negative effect and  risk on growth in zebrafish later life stages. Results further demonstrated that  adding arachidonic acid (AA) increased the transcripts of Pla(2), Ptgs1, Cyp19a  and Cxcl8b, allayed the accumulation of PLA(2) and 17β-E(2), and induced more  PGF2α, IFN and IL6 levels in zebrafish larvae, indicated AA metabolism might play  important regulatory roles on hormone synthesis and immune response caused by DIF  and TEB mixtures. Current results indicated the risk assessment of mixtures based  on single concentration may not precisely estimate the environmental risk and  health effect, it is crucially important to consider the multi-concentration  combinations, and more attention should be paid to the environmental  concentration.},

In the present study, a  series of computational methods including homology modeling, docking, and  molecular dynamics simulation studies were integrated to explore the binding  difference of fipronil with GABAARs from fruitfly and zebrafish systems. It was  found that, in the zebrafish system, the H-bond between 6'Thr and fipronil  exerted key effects on the recognition of fipronil, which was absent in the  fruitfly system. On the other hand, in the fruitfly system, strong electrostatic  interaction between 2'Ala and fipronil was favorable to the binding of fipronil  but detrimental to the binding in the zebrafish system. These findings marked the  binding difference of fipronil with different GABAARs, which might be helpful in  designing selective insecticides against pests instead of fishes.},

The aim of this study  was to investigate the toxic effects of carbendazim to zebrafish early life  stages at several levels of biological organization, including developmental,  biochemical and behavioural levels. The embryo assay was done following the OECD  guideline 236 and using a concentration range between 1.1 and 1.8mg/L. Lethal and  developmental endpoints such as hatching, edemas, malformations, heart beat rate,  body growth and delays were assessed in a 96h exposure. A sub-teratogenic range  (from 0.16 to 500μg/L) was then used to assess effects at biochemical and  behavioural levels. Biochemical markers included cholinesterase (ChE),  glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT)  and were assessed at 96h. The locomotor behaviour was assessed using an automated  video tracking system at 120h. Carbendazim (96h-LC50 of 1.75mg/L) elicited  several developmental anomalies in zebrafish embryos with EC50 values ranging  from 0.85 to 1.6mg/L. ChE, GST and LDH activities were increased at  concentrations equal or above 4μg/L. The locomotor assay showed to be extremely  sensitive, detecting effects in time that larvae spent swimming at concentrations  of 0.16μg/L and thus, being several orders of magnitude more sensitive that  developmental parameters or lethality. These are ecological relevant  concentrations and highlight the potential of behavioural endpoints as early  warning signs for environmental stress. Further studies should focus on  understanding how the behavioural disturbances measured in these types of studies  translate into fitness impairment at the adult stage.},

This study aims to explore the  differential expression proteins in the brain induced by their joint stress and  their joint effects, which are poorly reported, and devotes finding novel  biomarkers for monitoring their contamination in water and assessing their  neurological effects. The bioaccumulation of MP and Cd in tissues after 96 h of  exposure was first analyzed by GC and inductively coupled plasma-MS to provide  insights into the interaction. Protein profile changes in the brains of the  zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to MP and Cd were further investigated using the  proteomic approach. The correlation of gene expression on the transcription level  of mRNA and the translation level of protein was examined by real-time  quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis. It showed that Cd and MP have an  interaction on their bioaccumulation, which suggests that their joint effect over  96 h might be antagonistic. Proteomics revealed that 22 protein spots changed  their expression levels under stress, of which 16 proteins were identified using  MS. These proteins were involved in oxidation/reduction, metabolism, energy  production, receptor activity, and cytoskeleton assembly. Among them, five  proteins with a remarkable abundance change are significantly suggested to play  important roles in the joint effect. This work demonstrates that there exists an  interaction between MP and Cd toxicities, which may aid in our understanding of  the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by joint stress. The results may also  provide the possibility of the establishment of candidate biomarkers for  monitoring MP and Cd contamination in water.},

This study evaluated the overt toxicity, uptake, and neurobehavioral  effects of tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), tris (2-chloroethyl)  phosphate (TCEP), tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris  (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP) in early life stage zebrafish.

To evaluate uptake and metabolism,  zebrafish were exposed to 1 µM of each organophosphate (OP) flame retardant and  collected on 1 and 5 dpf to monitor accumulation. Larval swimming activity was  measured in 6 dpf larvae to evaluate neurobehavioral effects of exposures below  the acute toxicity threshold. TDBPP elicited the greatest toxicity at {\textgreater}1 µM.  TDCPP and chlorpyrifos were overtly toxic at concentrations ≥10 µM, TCEP, and  TCPP were not overtly toxic at the doses tested. Tissue concentrations increased  with increasing hydrophobicity of the parent chemical after 24 h exposures. TDCPP  and TDBPP and their respective metabolites were detected in embryos on 5 dpf. For  all chemicals tested, developmental exposures that were not overtly toxic  significantly altered larval swimming activity.

	abstract = {Niclosamide is an antihelminthic drug used worldwide for the treatment of tapeworm infections. Recent drug repurposing screens have highlighted the broad  bioactivity of niclosamide across diverse mechanisms of action. As a result,  niclosamide is being evaluated for a range of alternative drug-repurposing  applications, including the treatment of cancer, bacterial infections, and Zika  virus. As new applications of niclosamide will require non-oral delivery routes  that may lead to exposure in utero, it is important to understand the mechanism  of niclosamide toxicity during early stages of embryonic development. Previously,  we showed that niclosamide induces a concentration-dependent delay in epiboly  progression in the absence of effects on oxidative phosphorylation - a  well-established target for niclosamide. Therefore, the overall objective of this  study was to further examine the mechanism of niclosamide-induced epiboly delay  during zebrafish embryogenesis. Based on this study, we found that (1)  niclosamide exposure during early zebrafish embryogenesis resulted in a decrease  in yolk sac integrity with a concomitant decrease in the presence of yolk sac  actin networks and increase in cell size; (2) within whole embryos, niclosamide  exposure did not alter non-polar metabolites and lipids, but significantly  altered amino acids specific to aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; (3) niclosamide  significantly altered transcripts related to translation, transcription, and mRNA  processing pathways; and (4) niclosamide did not significantly alter levels of  rRNA and tRNA. Overall, our findings suggest that niclosamide may be causing a  systemic delay in embryonic development by disrupting the translation of  maternally-supplied mRNAs, an effect that may be mediated through disruption of  aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.},

Mixtures of atrazine (ATR) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) may elicit synergic effects on  the permanent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in certain aquatic  organisms, causing severe damage. Mechanistic mathematical models of  toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (TD) may be used to better characterize and  understand the interactions of these two chemicals. In this study, a previously  published generic physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model for fish was  adapted to ATR and CPF. A sub-model of the kinetics of one of the main  metabolites of CPF, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-oxon), was included, as well as a TD  model. Inhibition of two esterases, AChE and carboxylesterase, by ATR, CPF and  CPF-oxon, was modeled using TD modeling of quantities of total and inactive  esterases. Specific attention was given to the parameterization and calibration  of the model to accurately predict the concentration and effects observed in the  fish using Bayesian inference and published data from fathead minnow (Pimephales  promelas), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). A  PBTK-TD for mixtures was used to predict dose-response relationships for  comparison with available adult fish data.

Recently, it was reported that some PBDE including BDE-47 stimulates  locomotor activities of zebrafish embryos by unknown mechanism. In this study,  motor movements of the zebrafish embryo were used as a model system to evaluate  the neuronal toxicity of a non-coplanar PCB-dominant mixture (Aroclor 1254) and  BDE-47. Both organohalogens increased tail shaking and rotation of embryos in a  concentration-dependent manner. Chemical inhibition and gene knock-down of  tyrosine hydroxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) also induced  hyperactivities. Hyperactivities induced by these treatments were all inhibited  by supplementation of l-tyrosine and l-dopa, precursors of dopamine synthesis.  Both organohalogens reduced dopamine contents and increased the  3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/dopamine ratio in whole embryos. The  results suggest that functional inhibition of dopaminergic neurons is involved in  hyperactivities of zebrafish embryos caused by Aroclor 1254 and BDE-47.},

General activity, anxiety-like effects, and learning and memory in a  passive avoidance task were assessed after exposure to 20 or 40 μl/L neem. The  results showed that 20 μl/L neem reduced the number of runs. Both neem  concentrations increased the number of climbs to the water surface, and 40 μl/L  increased the number of tremors. In the anxiety test, the 20 μl/L dose increased  the number of entries in the light side compared with controls, but the latency  to enter the dark side and the freezing behavior in this side did not changed. In  relation to controls, the 40 μl/L neem reduced the latency to enter in the light  side, did not change the number of entries in this side and increased freezing  behavior in the light side. In the passive avoidance test, pre-training and  pre-test neem exposure to 40 μl/L decreased the response to the learning task.  Thus, no impairment was observed in this behavioral test.

Given similarities of OPFRs to organophosphate (OP)  pesticides, research into the possible neurotoxic impacts of developmental OPFR  exposure has been growing. Building upon research implicating exposure to OP  pesticides in dopaminergic (DA) dysfunction, we exposed developing zebrafish to  the OPFR tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), during the first 5 days  following fertilization. On day 6, larvae were challenged with acute  administration of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor antagonists and then tested in  a light-dark locomotor assay. We found that both developmental TDCIPP exposure  and acute dopamine D(1) and D(2) antagonism decreased locomotor activity  separately. The OPFR and DA effects were not additive; rather, TDCIPP blunted  further D(1) and D(2) antagonist-induced decreases in activity. Our results  suggest that TDCIPP exposure may be disrupting dopamine signaling. These findings  support further research on the effects of OPFR exposure on the normal  neurodevelopment of DA systems, whether these results might persist into  adulthood, and whether they interact with OPFR effects on other neurotransmitter  systems in producing the developmental neurobehavioral toxicity.},

Live video-microscopy revealed that the  profenofos exposed embryos exhibited an abnormal development, skeletal defects  and altered heart morphology in a concentration-dependent manner, which leads to  alterations in the swimming behavior of hatchlings at 144-h, which indicate that  developing zebrafish are sensitive to profenofos.},

When single and combined exposure to BPA (0,  2, and 20 μg/L) and n-TiO(2) (100 μg/L) were compared, combined exposure was  found to reciprocally facilitate bioaccumulation in adult fish while enhancing  maternal transfer to offspring. Thyroid endocrine disruption and developmental  neurotoxicity were observed in larval offspring by parental exposure to BPA alone  or in combination with n-TiO(2). Exposure to 20 μg/L BPA significantly decreased  the thyroxine (T4) concentration in adult plasma, leading to less transfer into  the eggs. The presence of 20 μg/L BPA with n-TiO(2) further decreased the level  of T4 compared to BPA exposure alone. Additionally, offspring larvae derived from  exposed parents exhibited lethargic swimming behavior. Overall, this study  examined the interactions of BPA and n-TiO(2) with regard to their  bioaccumulation, maternal transfer, and developmental effects, which highlighted  that co-exposure dynamics are important and need to be considered for accurate  environmental risk assessment.},

This study was to explore the toxic effect and the possible  mechanism of toxic action of acetochlor using zebrafish larvae whose toxicity  profiles have been confirmed to be strikingly similar with mammalian. The result  indicated that the toxic target organ of acetochlor was cardiovascular system.  Thus, cardiovascular toxicity evaluation was investigated systematically. The  main phenotypes of cardiovascular toxicity induced by acetochlor were  bradycardia, pericardial edema, circulation defect, and thrombosis; Malformed  heart was confirmed by histopathological examination. Thrombosis which maybe  triggered by bradycardia was further studied using o-dianisidine for erythrocyte  staining; Substantial thrombus in the caudal vein and significantly reduced heart  red blood cells (RBCs) intensity which can reflect the thrombosis degree were  observed in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the mRNA  expression level of Nkx2.5 and Gata4 related to induction of cardiac program were  down-regulated significantly by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  (qRT-PCR), which could cause defects in the cardiovascular system. For the first  time, our results demonstrated that acetochlor induced cardiovascular toxicity,  and down-regulation of Nkx2.5 and Gata4 might be its possible molecular basis.  Our data generated here might provide novel insights into cardiovascular disease  risk following acetochlor exposure to human, especially to pesticide suicides  population, occupational population and special population.},

	abstract = {Strobilurins are popular fungicides used in agriculture on a global scale. Due to their widespread use as agrochemicals, they can enter aquatic environments at  concentrations that can elicit adverse effects in organisms. This review  synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding the toxic effects of  strobilurin fungicides on aquatic species, including algal species, Daphnia  magna, and fish species, to determine risk to aquatic organisms and ecosystems.  Data show that the toxicities of strobilurins vary widely across aquatic species.  Strobilurins bind cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III in fungi, and as  such, research in aquatic species has focused on mitochondria-related endpoints  following exposures to strobilurins. In fish, studies into the activities of  mitochondrial complexes and the expression of genes involved in the electron  transfer chain have been conducted, converging on the theme that mitochondrial  complexes and their enzymes are impaired by strobilurins. In general, the order  of toxicity of strobilurins for fish species are  pyraoxystrobin {\textgreater} pyraclostrobin ≈ trifloxystrobin {\textgreater} picoxystrobin {\textgreater} kresoxim-methyl {\textgreater} fluoxastrobin {\textgreater} azoxystrobin.  In addition to mitochondrial toxicity, studies also report genotoxicity,  immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption, and each  of these events can potentially impact whole organism-level processes such as  development, reproduction, and behavior. Screening data from the US Environmental  Protection Agency ToxCast database supports the hypothesis that these fungicides  may act as endocrine disruptors, and high throughput data suggest estrogen  receptor alpha and thyroid hormone receptor beta can be activated by some  strobilurins. It is recommended that studies investigate the potential for  endocrine disruption by strobilurins more thoroughly in aquatic species. Based on  molecular, physiological, and developmental outcomes, a proposed adverse outcome  pathway is presented with complex III inhibition in the electron transfer chain  as a molecular initiating event. This review comprehensively addresses sub-lethal  toxicity mechanisms of strobilurin fungicides, important as the detection of  strobilurins in aquatic environments suggests exposure risks in wildlife.},

These behavioral responses can be unique to chemical specific  mechanisms and modes of action (MOA) and thus present diagnostic utility. In an  initial effort to explore the use of larval fish behavioral response patterns in  screening environmental contaminants for toxicity and to identify behavioral  responses associated with common chemical specific MOAs, we employed the two most  common fish models, the zebrafish and the fathead minnow, to define toxicant  induced swimming activity alterations during interchanging photoperiods. Though  the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is a common model for aquatic toxicology  research and regulatory toxicology practice, this model has received little  attention in behavioral studies compared to the zebrafish, a common biomedical  model. We specifically compared behavioral responses among 7 different chemicals  (1-heptanol, phenol, R-(-)-carvone, citalopram, diazinon, pentylenetetrazole  (PTZ), and xylazine) that were selected and classified based on anticipated MOA  (nonpolar narcosis, polar narcosis, electrophile, specific mechanism) according  to traditional approaches to examine whether these comparative responses differ  among chemicals with various structure-based predicted toxicity. Following  standardized experimental guidelines, zebrafish embryos and fathead minnow larvae  were exposed for 96 h to each compound then were observed using digital  behavioral analysis. Behavioral observations included photomotor responses,  distance traveled, and stimulatory, refractory and cruising locomotor activity.  Though fathead minnow larvae displayed greater behavioral sensitivity to  1-heptanol, phenol and citalopram, zebrafish were more sensitive to diazinon and  R-(-)-carvone. Both fish models were equally sensitive to xylazine and PTZ.  Further, the pharmaceuticals citalopram and xylazine significantly affected  behavior at therapeutic hazard values, and each of the seven chemicals elicited  unique behavioral response profiles. Larval fish behaviors appear useful as early  tier diagnostics to identify mechanisms and pathways associated with diverse  biological activities for chemicals lacking mechanistic data.},

Quantifying caudal fin regeneration largely depends on successfully measuring new  tissue formation through methods that require optimization and standardization.  Here, we present an improved methodology to characterize and analyse overall  caudal fin and bone regeneration in adult zebrafish. First, regenerated and  mineralized areas are evaluated through broad, rapid and specific chronological  and morphometric analysis in alizarin red stained fins. Then, following a more  refined strategy, the intensity of the staining within a 2D longitudinal plane is  determined through pixel intensity analysis, as an indicator of density or  thickness/volume. The applicability of this methodology on live specimens, to  reduce animal experimentation and provide a tool for in vivo tracking of the  regenerative process, was successfully demonstrated. Finally, the methodology was  validated on retinoic acid- and warfarin-treated specimens, and further confirmed  by micro-computed tomography. Because it is easily implementable, accurate and  does not require sophisticated equipment, the present methodology will certainly  provide valuable technical standardization for research in tissue engineering,  regenerative medicine and skeletal biology.},

	abstract = {Antidepressants are used by a substantial number of women in their childbearing years. Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since untreated depression poses  a risk to the mother and child. However, many antidepressants readily pass  through the placental barrier to reach the fetus or may be ingested by the  newborn via breastmilk. Little is known about the effects of antidepressants on  brain development and subsequent behavior in young children. In the current  study, we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the neurodevelopmental  effects of three commonly prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and  bupropion. Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and  were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social  behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that antidepressants  commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other  behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling,  we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects  induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles  induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism  of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant exposures lead to  specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. At present, it is not known if  antidepressants have similar effects in human development.},

	abstract = {Fluazinam is a pyridinamine fungicide that induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in cells, and it has been reported to be neurotoxic. To  characterize the biological effects of fluazinam, we assessed mitochondrial  bioenergetics, dopamine system expression, and behavior of early life staged  zebrafish (0.01 μM-0.5 μM). Fluazinam at environmentally-relevant levels did not  induce sub-lethal effects in larvae, but at the LC(50) (0.5 μM), fluazinam  decreased basal and ATP-linked respiration significantly in embryos. As  mitochondria are directly related to redox homeostasis and apoptosis, the  expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured.  Superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), heat stock protein 70 (hsp70), bcl2-associated X  protein (bax), and caspase 9 (casp9) mRNA levels were up-regulated by 0.5 μM  fluazinam. Taken together, there was evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and  oxidative damage at the highest concentration of fluazinam (0.5 μM) tested. As  there are reports for fluazinam-induced neurotoxicity in dopamine synthesizing  cells, transcriptional targets in the dopamine system were assessed in the  zebrafish. Tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine receptor 2a (drd2a) mRNA  levels were decreased by 0.5 μM fluazinam, suggesting that this fungicide may  affect the dopaminergic system. To further assess the potential for  fluazinam-mediated neuromodulation, the dark photokinesis response was assessed  in larvae following exposure. Larvae exposed to 0.1 μM fluazinam showed  hyperactivity, while larvae exposed to 0.2 and 0.3 μM showed hypo-activity. This  study demonstrates that fluazinam disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics in  zebrafish, inducing an oxidative stress response, and aberrant behaviors in  larvae that are dose dependent.},

Toxicity tests were performed based on OECD protocols and mortality and  behavioural changes were assed for all stages.

Genotoxicity was  evaluated in adults. Results showed a higher sensitivity of juvenile and adults  of zebrafish (96h-LC10 values of 14.0 and 55.4μg/L, respectively). For embryos a  96h-LC10 of 147.1μg/L was calculated, moreover developmental anomalies and  hatching inhibition were observed only at high concentrations ({\textgreater}400μg/L), whereas  biochemical and behavioural responses occurred at lower concentrations ({\textless}60μg/L).  Behavioural responses (lethargy) occurred in all life stages. Biochemical  responses were observed including the inhibition of GST in adults and changes in  ChE, CAT, LDH activities and VTG levels in embryos. Ivermectin did not show to be  genotoxic for adult fish. The species sensitivity distribution analysis, based on  fish and invertebrate species, indicated a Hazardous Concentration for 5\% of the  population (HC5) value of 0.057μg/L; suggesting high sensitivity of both groups  to ivermectin and a high risk of this compound to aquatic ecosystems.},

Exposure to organophosphates, either through  accidents or acts of terrorism, poses a significant risk to human health and  safety. Existing antidotes, in use for over 50 years, have modest efficacy and  undesirable toxicities. Therefore, discovering new organophosphate antidotes is a  high priority. Early life stage zebrafish exposed to organophosphates exhibit  several phenotypes that parallel the human response to organophosphates,  including behavioral deficits, paralysis, and eventual death. Here, we have  developed a high-throughput zebrafish screen in a 96-well plate format to find  new antidotes that counteract organophosphate-induced lethality. In a pilot  screen of 1200 known drugs, we identified 16 compounds that suppress  organophosphate toxicity in zebrafish. Several in vitro assays coupled with  liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling enabled  determination of mechanisms of action for several of the antidotes, including  reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cholinergic receptor antagonism, and  inhibition of bioactivation. Therefore, the in vivo screen is capable of  discovering organophosphate antidotes that intervene in distinct pathways. These  findings suggest that zebrafish screens might be a broadly applicable approach  for discovering compounds that counteract the toxic effects of accidental or  malicious poisonous exposures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants until the early 2000s, mainly in home furnishings and electronics. The  persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to  low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults.  Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages  can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We  investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent  PBDEs; 2,2',4,4',5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and  2,2',4,4',-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short-  and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide  chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from  zebrafish to humans. METHODS: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following  individual treatments; 0.1\% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3μM CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1,  0.3μM BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20μM BDE-99 from 5 until 120h post  fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing  immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level  range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately  6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including  assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation,  social interaction, and predator avoidance. RESULTS: In the short-term, larval  locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3μM CPF and 0.1μM BDE-47.  BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3μM causing  hyperactivity and 1μM or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult  anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the  novel tank dive test and tap test. DISCUSSION: We show that exposure of zebrafish  embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and  BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term  behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure  concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult  behavior was still strongly affected.},

In this context, zebrafish embryos were exposed to serial doses of  EC. According to the results, it was observed that EC exposure caused a  significant decrease in survival and hatching rates as well as significant body  malformations. Whole-mount staining results showed that EC caused dose-dependent  increased apoptosis. Oxidative stress caused by EC exposure was demonstrated by  whole-mount staining, transcriptional and immunohistochemically. Furthermore, it  has been shown histochemically that EC exposure causes necrosis and degeneration  in the brain. In behavioral tests, it was observed that EC caused hyperactivity  associated with these neuronal degenerations. In addition, a dramatic decrease in  blood flow was detected in association with pericardial edema. In the light of  the current results, it should be carefully considered that EC can be found  naturally in many human diets, especially fermented foods.},

Using  zebrafish as the model, we investigated how different classes of insecticides  influence fish behavior and uncovered neuronal underpinnings of the associated  behavioral changes, providing an unprecedented insight into the perception of  these chemicals by fish. We observed that zebrafish larvae avoid diazinon and  imidacloprid while showing no response to other insecticides with the same mode  of action. Moreover, ablation of olfaction abolished the aversive responses,  indicating that fish smelled the insecticides. Assessment of neuronal activity in  289 brain regions showed that hypothalamic areas involved in stress response were  among the regions with the largest changes, indicating that the observed  behavioral response resembles reactions to stimuli that threaten homeostasis,  such as changes in water chemistry.

Twenty-four pesticides were found in river water  samples. The most frequently found were atrazine, quinclorac and clomazone.  During exposure (96 h) spontaneous movement, the heart rate and hatching rate  were evaluated. After the exposure time the embryos were euthanized for  biochemical assays. We analyzed biomarkers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive  substance (TBARS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST)  and catalase (CAT). We observed increases in GST and TBARS, especially during  periods of major water contamination such as January, February, October, and  November.

GO primarily promoted MRC  activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and fatty acid β-oxidation, thus activating  the energy metabolism of zebrafish and leading to antagonistic effects on the  developmental toxicity of TDCIPP.

Concerning the  antioxidant defense system, PQ increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione  peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as the non-protein sulfhydryl content  (NPSH), but did not change ROS formation and decreased lipid peroxidation. We  demonstrate, for the first time, that PQ induces an increase in aggressive  behavior, alters non-motor patterns associated to defensive behaviors, and  changes redox parameters in zebrafish brain. Overall, our findings may serve as  useful tools to investigate the interaction between behavioral and neurochemical  impairments triggered by PQ administration in zebrafish.},

	abstract = {The toxic effects of several species of fresh water cyanobacteria, notably Microcystis species and associated toxins, the microcystins, Anabaena species  (anatoxin), Nodularia sp. (nodularin), and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii  (cylindrospermopsin), are well known. Little, however, is known about the effects  of secondary metabolites other than alkaloids. Early life stage tests with  zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to detect bioactive properties of compounds  released by healthy cyanobacteria (Fischerella ambigua), particularly on the  early developmental stages of fish. This approach, using F. ambigua is probably  most valuable as it shows the toxicity of healthy growing cyanobacteria. The  effects of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites on the embryonic stages of fish  are of considerable interest as many aquatic creatures, particularly fish, are  unable to avoid the potential toxins that may be released by undesirable algal  blooms or as a result of allelopathic effects. In the current study, the  zebrafish (D. rerio) was used as a model experimental system to investigate the  effects of ambigols A and C, tjipanazole D and C, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, cell  free culture media, and media extracts of a terrestrial/fresh water strain of the  cyanobacterium F. ambigua on embryo development. Fish embryo tests performed with  the cell free culture medium showed that after 3h of exposure to undiluted  culture medium all fish embryos died. At a tenfold dilution the process of  epiboly (formation of the gastrula) was retarded in all embryos, lesions were  observed, and their general development was significantly arrested, finally  followed by death. The same tests performed with extracts (dichloromethane,  n-butanol, and residual cell free culture medium) of the cell free culture  medium, ambigol A, ambigol C, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and tjipanazole D showed  only ambigol A to have an influence on zebrafish development at  concentrations{\textgreater}or=1 mg/l (2.06 microM). After 55 h all embryos showed pectoral  oedema, irregularly shaped fin folds, bent tails, and unusual circular neoplasms  in the dorsal tail fin fold. Due to the high concentration of ambigol A used in  this assay these effects were considered to be of minor importance when compared  to those of the culture medium.},

In this manuscript we show  that 24 h exposure to environmental concentrations of fenitrothion, from ng/L to  low μg/L, altered basal locomotor activity, visual-motor response and  acoustic/vibrational escape response of zebrafish larvae. Furthermore,  fenitrothion and expression of gap43a, gfap, atp2b1a, and mbp exhibited a  significant non-monotonic concentration-response relationship. Once determined  that environmental concentrations of fenitrothion were neurotoxic for zebrafish  larvae, a computational analysis identified potential protein targets of this  compound. Some of the predictions, including interactions with  acetylcholinesterase, monoamine-oxidases and androgen receptor (AR), were  experimentally validated. Binding to AR was the most suitable candidate for  molecular initiating event, as indicated by both the up-regulation of cyp19a1b  and sult2st3 and the non-monotonic relationship found between fenitrothion and  the observed responses. Finally, when the integrity of the monoaminergic system  was evaluated, altered levels of L-DOPA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA were found, as  well as a significant up-regulation of slc18a2 expression at the lowest  concentrations of fenitrothion. These data strongly suggest that concentrations  of fenitrothion commonly found in aquatic ecosystems present a significant  environmental risk for fish communities.},

A total of 7900  peptides were analyzed, 90 of which were differentially expressed, with 29 being  up-regulated and 61 down-regulated. These peptides were investigated using  ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and gene ontology (GO) analysis to explore their  role in eye development. This study identified 18 peptides associated with the  development of the optic nerve and ocular system in the PCB-exposure group, as  well as 10 peptides that are located in the functional domain of their precursor  proteins. These peptides provide potential biomarkers for the treatment of ocular  dysplasia caused by PCBs and may help us understand the mechanism of abnormal eye  development caused by organic pollutants.},

	abstract = {DNA mismatch repair (MMR) of simple base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 (MSH2)-MSH6  heterodimer to mismatched DNA. Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has  been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA  repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our  previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of  MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if  Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the  exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal  concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2,  MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by  real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50\% of control after a 9-h  exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of  catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a  wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and  pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), d-mannitol  or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 μM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR  confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA  production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50\% of control were  also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species  (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM. Hence, Cd at  sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as  signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be  fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Sp1). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA  binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band  shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in  Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos.},

The fungicide Mancozeb (MZ) has been used on a large-scale and is a  potent inducer of oxidative stress. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the  development of more sensitive biomarkers designed to earlier biomonitoring of  this compound. Here we tested the hypothesis that behavioral changes induced by  sublethal MZ concentrations would occur first as compared to biochemical  oxidative stress markers. Embryos at 4 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to  Mancozeb at 5, 10 and 20 μg/L. Controls were kept in embryo water only.  Behavioral and biochemical parameters were evaluated at 24, 28, 72, and 168 hpf  after MZ exposure. The results showed that MZ significantly altered spontaneous  movement, escape responses, swimming capacity, and exploratory behavior at all  exposure times. However, changes in ROS steady-stead levels and the activity of  antioxidant enzymes were observable only at 72 and 168 hpf. In conclusion,  behavioral changes occurred earlier than biochemical alterations in zebrafish  embryos exposed to MZ, highlighting the potential of behavioral biomarkers as  sensitive tools for biomonitoring programs.},

Using zebrafish as a  model, the objectives of this study were to rely on (1) mRNA-sequencing to  uncover pathways disrupted following embryonic TPHP exposure and (2) high-content  screening to identify nuclear receptor ligands that enhance or mitigate  TPHP-induced cardiotoxicity. Based on mRNA-sequencing, TPHP exposure from 24 to  72-h postfertilization (hpf) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in  the number of transcripts significantly affected at 72 hpf, and pathway analysis  revealed that 5 out of 9 nuclear receptor pathways were associated with the  retinoid X receptor (RXR). Based on a screen of 74 unique nuclear receptor  ligands as well as follow-up experiments, 2 compounds-ciglitazone (a peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma, or PPARγ, agonist) and fenretinide (a  pan-retinoic acid receptor, or RAR, agonist)-reliably mitigated TPHP-induced  cardiotoxicity in the absence of effects on TPHP uptake or metabolism. As these  data suggested that TPHP may be activating RXR (a heterodimer for both RARs and  PPARγ), we coexposed embryos to HX 531-a pan-RXR antagonist-from 24 to 72 hpf  and, contrary to our hypothesis, found that coexposure to HX 531 significantly  enhanced TPHP-induced cardiotoxicity. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we also  found that TPHP did not activate nor inhibit chimeric human RXRα, RXRβ, or RXRγ,  suggesting that TPHP does not directly bind nor interact with RXRs. Overall, our  data suggest that TPHP may interfere with RXR-dependent pathways involved in  cardiac development.},

Following exposure, a subset of larvae was placed into clean water for 6days  (i.e. depuration phase).

At the end of depuration, there was no detectable change  in neuro-morphological endpoints that included the ratio of notochord length to  body length (\%) and the ratio of head area to body area (\%). However, DLD did  induce cardiac edema, skeletal deformities, and tremors. GABA-related transcripts  were not affected in abundance by DLD. Conversely, the relative mRNA levels of  dopamine transporter (dat1) and dopamine receptor drd2a mRNA were decreased in  dechorionated, but not chorionated, embryos. These data suggest that DLD can  alter the expression of transcripts related to dopaminergic signaling. Lastly,  GABA(A) receptor subunits gabrB1 and gabrB2, as well as dopamine receptors drd1  and drd2a, were inherently higher in abundance in dechorionated embryos compared  to chorionated embryos. This is an important consideration when incorporating  transcriptomics into embryo testing as expression levels can change with removal  of the chorion prior to exposure.},

However, the toxic effects of CBZ on aquatic  organisms have received limited attention. In this study, male adult zebrafish  were exposed at 0, 30 and 100 μg/L CBZ for 21 days to assess its effects on  hepatic glycolipid metabolism. After exposure, the body weight and length  decreased, but the condition factor increased significantly. Some hepatic  biochemical parameters including the levels of glucose, pyruvate, low density  lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) decreased significantly in the liver of  zebrafish after exposure with CBZ. Two transaminases alanine transaminase (ALT)  and aspartate transaminase (AST) also increased significantly, indicating that  subchronic CBZ exposure influenced the liver function. Moreover, the relative  mRNA levels of some key genes related to the glycolysis and lipid metabolism in  the liver also changed significantly. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis  showed that the carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism and detoxification metabolism  were also affected in the liver of CBZ exposed zebrafish. Interestingly, we also  found the amounts of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria,  α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at phylum level  significantly decreased in the gut.

The increased number of BrdU- and proliferating cell  nuclear antigen-labeled cells were shown in zebrafish treated with 200μM  physostigmine, which was inhibited by pretreatment with 200μM scopolamine. iNOS  mRNA expression was increased in the brain of zebrafish treated with 200μM  physostigmine.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: About one third of all patients with epilepsy have pharmacoresistant seizures. Thus there is a need for better pharmacological treatments. The human  voltage-gated potassium (hK(V) ) channel hK(V) 7.2/7.3 is a validated antiseizure  target for compounds that activate this channel. In a previous study we have  shown that resin acid derivatives can activate the hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel. In this  study we investigated if these channel activators have the potential to be  developed into a new type of antiseizure drug. Thus we examined their  structure-activity relationships and the site of action on the hK(V) 7.2/7.3  channel, if they have unwanted cardiac and cardiovascular effects, and their  potential antiseizure effect. METHODS: Ion channels were expressed in Xenopus  oocytes or mammalian cell lines and explored with two-electrode voltage-clamp or  automated patch-clamp techniques. Unwanted vascular side effects were  investigated with isometric tension recordings. Antiseizure activity was studied  in an electrophysiological zebrafish-larvae model. RESULTS: Fourteen resin acid  derivatives were tested on hK(V) 7.2/7.3. The most efficient channel activators  were halogenated and had a permanently negatively charged sulfonyl group. The  compounds did not bind to the sites of other hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel activators,  retigabine, or ICA-069673. Instead, they interacted with the most extracellular  gating charge of the S4 voltage-sensing helix, and the effects are consistent  with an electrostatic mechanism. The compounds altered the voltage dependence of  hK(V) 7.4, but in contrast to retigabine, there were no effects on the maximum  conductance. Consistent with these data, the compounds had less smooth  muscle-relaxing effect than retigabine. The compounds had almost no effect on the  voltage dependence of hK(V) 11.1, hNa(V) 1.5, or hCa(V) 1.2, or on the amplitude  of hK(V) 11.1. Finally, several resin acid derivatives had clear antiseizure  effects in a zebrafish-larvae model. SIGNIFICANCE: The described resin acid  derivatives hold promise for new antiseizure medications, with reduced risk for  adverse effects compared with retigabine.},

The acute toxicities of the  model substances and the sediment extracts were determined by means of the fish  embryo test as specified in OECD TG 236, and concentrations as low as the  effective concentration at 10\% inhibition (EC10) were used as the highest test  concentration in the acetylcholinesterase test in order to avoid nonspecific  systemic effects mimicking neurotoxicity. Among the model compounds, only the  known acetylcholinesterase inhibitors paraoxon-methyl and chlorpyrifos produced a  strong inhibition to about 20 and 33\%, respectively, of the negative controls.  For the sediment extracts, a reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity to about  60\% could only be shown for the Vering Canal sediment extracts; this could be  correlated to high contents of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as identified by chemical analyses. Co-incubation of  the Vering Canal sediment extracts with chlorpyrifos at EC10 concentrations each  did not significantly increase the inhibitory effect of chlorpyrifos, indicating  that the mode of action of acetylcholinesterase inhibition by the sediment-borne  PAHs is different to that of the typical acetylcholinesterase blocker  chlorpyrifos. Overall, the study documents that zebrafish embryos represent a  suitable model not only to reveal acetylcholinesterase inhibition, but also to  investigate various modes of neurotoxic action.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroids are commonly used insecticides that are considered to pose little risk to human health. However, there is an increasing concern that children are  more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. We used the zebrafish  model to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to low doses of the  pyrethroid deltamethrin results in persistent alterations in dopaminergic gene  expression, neurochemistry, and locomotor activity. Zebrafish embryos were  treated with deltamethrin (0.25-0.50 μg/l), at concentrations below the LOAEL,  during the embryonic period [3-72 h postfertilization (hpf)], after which  transferred to fresh water until the larval stage (2-weeks postfertilization).  Deltamethrin exposure resulted in decreased transcript levels of the D1 dopamine  (DA) receptor (drd1) and increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase at 72 hpf. The  reduction in drd1 transcripts persisted to the larval stage and was associated  with decreased D2 dopamine receptor transcripts. Larval fish, exposed  developmentally to deltamethrin, had increased levels of homovanillic acid, a DA  metabolite. Since the DA system is involved in locomotor activity, we measured  the swim activity of larval fish following a transition to darkness.  Developmental exposure to deltamethrin significantly increased larval swim  activity which was attenuated by concomitant knockdown of the DA transporter.  Acute exposure to methylphenidate, a DA transporter inhibitor, increased swim  activity in control larva, while reducing swim activity in larva developmentally  exposed to deltamethrin. Developmental exposure to deltamethrin causes locomotor  deficits in larval zebrafish, which is likely mediated by dopaminergic  dysfunction. This highlights the need to understand the persistent effects of  low-dose neurotoxicant exposure during development.},

	abstract = {Chronic pollution in aquatic ecosystems can lead to many adverse effects, including a greater susceptibility to pathogens among resident biota.  Trifloxystrobin (TFS) is a strobilurin fungicide widely used in Asia to control  soybean rust. However, it has the potential to enter aquatic ecosystems, where it  may impair fish resistance to viral infections. To explore the potential  environmental risks of TFS, we characterized the antiviral capacities of fish  chronically exposed to TFS and subsequently infected with spring viraemia of carp  virus (SVCV). Although TFS exhibited no significant cytotoxicity at the tested  environmental concentrations during viral challenge, SVCV replication increased  significantly in a time-dependent manner within epithelioma papulosum cyprini  (EPC) cells and zebrafish exposed to 25 μg/L TFS. Results showed that the highest  viral load was more than 100-fold that of the controls. Intracellular biochemical  assays indicated that autophagy was induced by TFS, and associated changes  included an increase in autophagosomes, conversion of LC3-II, accumulation of  Beclin-1, and degradation of P62 in EPC cells and zebrafish. In addition, TFS  markedly decreased the expression and phosphorylation of mTOR, indicating that  activation of TFS may be associated with the mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway.  This study provides new insights into the mechanism of the immunosuppressive  effects of TFS on non-target aquatic hosts and suggests that the existence of TFS  in aquatic environments may contribute to outbreaks of viral diseases.},

	abstract = {Organophosphates, a type of neurotoxicant pesticide, are used globally for the treatment of pests on croplands and are therefore found in a large number of  conventional foods. These pesticides are harmful and potentially deadly if  ingested or inhaled in large quantities by causing a significant reduction in  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the central and peripheral nervous  system. However, much less is known about the effects of exposure to small  quantities of the pesticides on neural systems and behavior during development.  In the current study we used zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects  of two of the most widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on  zebrafish behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the  organophosphates during different time points in development and then tested at 5  days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental and AChE  abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that chlorpyrifos and malathion  cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such as swim speed (hypoactivity vs.  hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally, the pesticides affect only certain  behaviors, such as thigmotaxis, during specific time points in development that  are unrelated to changes in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not  chlorpyrifos also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions  compared to controls by 5 days post-fertilization. We conclude that exposure to  very low concentrations of organophosphate pesticides during development cause  abnormalities in behavior and brain size.},

Our  aim was to characterize the life-long neurobehavioral effects of 4 widely used  OPFRs using the zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1\% DMSO  (vehicle control); or one of the following treatments; isopropylated phenyl  phosphate (IPP) (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 µM); butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP)  (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 µM); 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) (0.03, 0.3,  1 µM); isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDDP) (0.1, 0.3, 1, 10 µM) from 0- to 5-days  postfertilization. On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under  alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the exposed  fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to assess  emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction and predator  evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term effects of altered  motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds, and long-term impairment of  anxiety-related behavior in adults following IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures. Our  results show that OPFRs may not be a safe alternative to the phased-out BFRs and  may cause behavioral impacts throughout the lifespan. Further research should  evaluate the risk to mammalian experimental models and humans.},

Although the  assessment of potential effects of environmental pollutants sorbed to MPs under  chronic exposure scenarios seems vital, data on potential hazards and risk by  combined exposure to pollutants and microplastics for aquatic vertebrates is  still limited. Therefore, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed over 21 days to  the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF; 10 and 100 ng/L) and the PAH  benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF; 0.78 and 50 µg/L) either dissolved directly in water  or sorbed to different MPs (irregular polystyrene, spherical polymethyl  methacrylate; ≤ 100 µm), where CPF was sorbed to polystyrene MPs and BkF was  sorbed to polymethyl methacrylate MPs. Contaminant sorption to MPs and leaching  were documented using GC-EI-MS; potential accumulation was studied in  cryosections of the gastrointestinal tract. Enzymatic biomarkers and  biotransformation were measured in liver and brain. Overall, exposure to  non-contaminated MPs did not induce any adverse effects. Results of fluorescence  tracking, CYP1A modulation by BkF as well as changes in acetylcholinesterase  activity (AChE) by CPF were less pronounced when contaminants were sorbed to MPs,  indicating reduced bioavailability of pollutants. Overall, following exposure to  waterborne BkF, only minor amounts of parent BkF and biotransformation products  were detected in zebrafish liver. Even high loads of MPs and sorbed contaminants  did not induce adverse effects in zebrafish; thus, the potential threat of MPs as  vectors for contaminant transfer in limnic ecosystems can be considered limited.},

Mutations in two members of this family, K(v)7.2 (KCNQ2) and K(v)7.3 (KCNQ3) are  associated with a neurological disorder known as benign familial neonatal  convulsion (BFNC). Despite their importance in normal and pathological brain  function, developmental expression and function of these channels remains  relatively unexplored. Here, we examined the temporal expression of K(v)7 channel  subunits in zebrafish larvae using a real-time quantitative PCR approach. Spatial  expression in the larval zebrafish brain was assessed using whole-mount in situ  hybridization. The mRNA for three members of the K(v)7 family (KCNQ2, 3 and 5) is  reported in zebrafish between two and seven days post-fertilization (dpf). Using  electrophysiological techniques, we show that inhibitors of K(v)7 channels  (linopirdine and XE991) induce burst discharge activity in immature zebrafish  between 3 and 7 dpf. This abnormal electrical activity is blocked by a K(v)7  channel opener (retigabine) and was also shown to evoke convulsive behaviors in  freely swimming zebrafish. Using morpholino oligonucleotides directed against  KCNQ3, we confirmed a role for KCNQ channels in generation of electrical burst  discharges. These results indicate that functional K(v)7 channels are expressed  in the larval zebrafish nervous system and could play a direct role in generation  of seizure activity.},

Zebrafish larvae exposed to PND showed  mortality and developed sublethal alterations including impaired fin development,  lordosis, scoliosis, blood congestion, impaired blood flow, and reduced  heartbeat. PND exposure (0.5 mg/L) affects musculoskeletal development leading to  delayed and reduced ossification of the vertebral centra in the developing  vertebral column and disruption of muscle morphology. Herbicide exposure (0.5  mg/L and 0.05 mg/L) led also to biochemical changes of antioxidant enzymes,  increasing the activity of CAT, GR, and GPx, while no effects were observed on  the activity of SOD and GST in zebrafish larvae. Lastly, AChE activity, a  biochemical marker of neurotoxicity, was also increased in zebrafish larvae  exposed to 0.5 mg/L of PND. These results confirm the developmental toxicity of  PND in zebrafish early-life stages, pointing out the potential role of oxidative  stress in the onset of sublethal alterations.},

	abstract = {As a result of the ban on some brominated flame retardants (BFRs), the use of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) increases, and they are detected in  multi-environment media at higher frequency and concentrations. However, the  toxicity data of OPFRs, especially those on developmental toxicology are quite  limited, which prevents an accurate evaluation of their environmental and health  risk. Because a previous study reported that two aryl-OPFRs induced  cardiotoxicity during zebrafish embryogenesis, we designed experiments to compare  the heart developmental toxicity of a series of aryl-OPFRs with alkyl-OPFRs and  explored possible internal mechanism. First, acute toxicity of 9 frequently used  OPFRs were studied with zebrafish embryos (2-96 hpf). By comparing the LC50 and  EC50 (pericardium edema) data, two aryl-OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and  cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) showed greater heart developmental toxicity than  the others. It was also found that the acute toxicity of OPFRs varied mainly  depending on their hydrophobicity. Further study on the cardiotoxicity of TPhP  and CDP showed that the cardiac looping progress can be impeded by 0.10mg/L TPhP  or CDP exposure. Bradycardia and reduction of myocardium were also observed in  0.50 and 1.0mg/L TPhP groups and 0.10, 0.50, and 1.0mg/L CDP groups. 0-48 hpf is  the vulnerable window of zebrafish cardiogenesis that can be easily affected by  TPhP and CDP. RT-qPCR measurement on the expressions of key transcriptional  regulators in cardiogenesis showed that BMP4, NKX2-5, and TBX5 were significantly  inhibited at the exposure points of 12 hpf and 24 hpf which may be the internal  factors related to the heart developmental toxicity. As zebrafish is a good model  organism for human health study, the present results call for a greater attention  to the health risk of fetus in pregnant women exposed to such OPFRs.},

	abstract = {The embryotoxicity of co-planar PCBs is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), and has been reported to involve oxidative stress. Ahr  participates in crosstalk with another transcription factor, Nfe2l2, or Nrf2.  Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements to regulate the adaptive response to  oxidative stress. To explore aspects of the crosstalk between Nrf2 and Ahr and  its impact on development, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio) with a mutated DNA  binding domain in Nrf2a (nrf2a(fh318/fh318)), rendering these embryos more  sensitive to oxidative stress. Embryos were exposed to 2 nM or 5 nM PCB126 at 24  h post fertilization (prim-5 stage of pharyngula) and examined for gene  expression and morphology at 4 days post fertilization (dpf; protruding - mouth  stage). Nrf2a mutant eleutheroembryos were more sensitive to PCB126 toxicity at 4  dpf, and in the absence of treatment also displayed some subtle developmental  differences from wildtype embryos, including delayed inflation of the swim  bladder and smaller yolk sacs. We used qPCR to measure changes in expression of  the nrf gene family, keap1a, keap1b, the ahr gene family, and known target genes.  cyp1a induction by PCB126 was enhanced in the Nrf2a mutants (156-fold in  wildtypes vs. 228-fold in mutants exposed to 5 nM). Decreased expression of heme  oxygenase (decycling) 1 (hmox1) in the Nrf2a mutants was accompanied by increased  nrf2b expression. Target genes of Nrf2a and AhR2, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase  1 (nqo1) and glutathione S-transferase, alpha-like (gsta1), showed a 2-5-fold  increase in expression in the Nrf2a mutants as compared to wildtype.

Many of these compounds are endocrine  disruptors (EDCs) that target estrogen signaling, with effects on reproductive  and non-reproductive tissues. We recently reported that zebrafish larvae  transiently exposed to the pharmaceutical EDC 4-OH-A display visual deficits as  adults. Here, we examine whether these long-term effects are due to  compound-induced morphological and/or cellular changes. Zebrafish aged 24 h,  48 h, 72 h, or 7 days post-fertilization (larvae) or 3-4mos (adults) were exposed  to either 4-OH-A or PCB(1254) for 24 h. After that time, notochord length, eye  diameter, inter-eye distance, and heart rate were measured from larvae; and  aromatase (estrogen synthase) activity was measured in homogenates of adult brain  tissue. In general, indices of larval growth and development were not altered by  24 h exposure to either compound. 4-OH-A potently inhibited aromatase activity,  while PCB(1254) did not, with inhibition continuing even after removal from  treatment. These results support differential function of EDCs and indicate that  developmental exposure to 4-OH-A causes sustained inhibition of aromatase, which  could be associated with altered adult behaviors.},

We found that  cardiac and neural crest (NC)-derived jaw and branchial cartilages are  specifically targeted early in development. The suite of malformations, which  ultimately leads to circulatory failure, includes a severely dysmorphic heart  with a reduced bulbus arteriosus and abnormal atrioventricular and outflow valve  formation. Early NC migration and patterning of the jaw and branchial cartilages  was normal. However, the jaw and branchial cartilages failed to grow to normal  size. In the heart, the ventricular myocardium showed a reduction in cell number  and size. The heart and jaw/branchial phenotype could be rescued by  pifithrin-alpha, a blocker of p53. However, the function of pifithrin-alpha in  this model may act as a competitive inhibitor of PCB at the AHR and is likely  independent of p53. Morpholinos against p53 did not rescue the phenotype, nor  were zebrafish with a mutant p53-null allele resistant to PCB126 toxicity.  Morpholino knockdown of cardiac troponin T, which blocks the onset of cardiac  function, prevented the PCB126-induced cardiac dysmorphogenesis but not the  jaw/branchial phenotype. The cardiovascular characteristics appear to be similar  to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and introduce the potential of  zebrafish as a model to study this environmentally induced cardiovascular  malformation. HLHS is a severe congenital cardiovascular malformation that has  previously been linked to industrial releases of dioxins and PCBs.},

Because of their  relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have  reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published  literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of  vertebrates to neonicotinoids. METHODS: Using zebrafish, we investigated the  neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic  neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish  were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 μM or 60 μM of  imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4h to 5d post fertilization.  The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidacloprid and  nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and during adolescence  and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of  sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank  swimming, and shoaling behavior. RESULTS: In larvae, developmental imidacloprid  exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains  of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidacloprid than the AB*  strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid  significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor  response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming,  it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects  of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling  stimulus. DISCUSSION: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both  early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its  developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated.},

In the current study, we found  that CiCXCL20a, a teleost-specific chemokine from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon  idella), demonstrates broad-spectrum, potent, direct bactericidal activity and  immunomodulatory functions to bacterial infections, apart from the chemotaxis.  CiCXCL20a kills bacteria by binding, mainly targeting acid lipids, perforating  bacterial membrane, resulting in bacterial cytoplasm leakage and death. CiCXCL20a  aggregates and neutralizes LPS, agglutinates Gram-negative bacteria, and binds to  peptidoglycan and Gram-positive bacteria, but not agglutinate them. All the  complexes may be phagocytized and cleared away. CiCXCL20a chemoattracts  leukocytes, facilitates phagocytosis of myeloid leukocytes, not lymphoid  leukocytes, and enhances the bacteria-killing ability in leukocytes. We further  identified its receptor CiCXCR3.1b1. Furthermore, we investigated the  physiological roles of CiCXCL20a against Aeromonas hydrophila infection in vivo.  The recombinant CiCXCL20a increases the survival rate and decreases the tissue  bacterial loads, edema, and lesions. Then, we verified this function by purified  CiCXCL20a Ab blockade, and the survival rate decreases, and the tissue bacterial  burdens increase. In addition, zebrafish (Danio rerio) DrCXCL20, an ortholog of  CiCXCL20a, was employed to verify the bactericidal function and mechanism. The  results indicated that DrCXCL20 also possesses wide-spectrum, direct bactericidal  activity through membrane rupture mechanism. The present study, to our knowledge,  provides the first evidence that early vertebrate chemokine prevents from  bacterial infections by direct bactericidal and phagocytosis-killing-promoting  manners. The results also demonstrate the close functional relationship between  chemokines and antimicrobial peptides.},

The results showed the loading capacity of  PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles for pyraclostrobin was 15.7 ± 0.5\% and the TA-Cu  complexes deposited on the MSNs surface could protect pyraclostrobin against  photodegradation effectively. The nanoparticles had excellent pH responsive  release performance due to the decomposition of TA-Cu complexes under the acid  condition, which showed 8.53 ± 0.37\%, 82.38 ± 1.67\% of the encapsulated  pyraclostrobin were released at pH 7.4, pH 4.5 after 7 d respectively. The  contact angle and adhesion work of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles on rice foliage  were 86.3° ± 2.7° and 75.8 ± 3.1 mJ/m(2) after 360 s respectively, indicating  that TA on the surface of the nanoparticles could improve deposition efficiency  and adhesion ability on crop foliage. The control effect of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu  nanoparticles against Rhizoctonia solani with 400 mg/L of pyraclostrobin was  85.82\% after 7 d, while that of the same concentration of pyraclostrobin EC was  53.05\%. The PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles did not show any phytotoxicity to the  growth of rice plants. Meanwhile, the acute toxicity of PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu  nanoparticles to zebrafish was decreased more than 9-fold compared with that of  pyraclostrobin EC. Thus, pH-responsive PYR@MSNs-TA-Cu nanoparticles have great  potential for enhancing targeting and environmental safety of the active  ingredient.},

To further investigate the effects of fenvalerate on  embryos and larvae, acridine orange staining was performed at a 50 microg/L  concentration. Staining showed notable signs of apoptosis mainly in the brain.  Further studies revealed that fenvalerate induced alterations in SOD activity in  larvae were concentration dependent and also related to the length of exposure.  Fenvalerate also down-regulated the expression of ogg1 and dlx2 genes in a  concentration dependent manner, which indicated that the oxidative-DNA repair  system as well as neurogenesis were impaired. In this study, we investigated the  toxicity of fenvalerate using zebrafish, that provided new evidence of observable  brain impairment during embryogenesis due to fenvalerate exposure and discussed  their implications for the development of fenvalerate induced neurotoxicity.},

No obvious differences of dysregulation of gene expression caused by  racemic and (-)-PCB149, were observed in embryo-larvae.

	abstract = {Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) is an organophosphate flame retardant that is frequently detected in the environments. TPhP exposure is known to cause  developmental toxicity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain  underestimated. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were acutely exposed to  0, 4 and 100 μg/L TPhP until 144 h post-fertilization. Profiles of differentially  expressed proteins were constructed using a shotgun proteomic. With the input of  differential proteins, principal component analysis suggested different protein  expression profiles for 4 and 100 μg/L TPhP. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway  analyses further found that effects of TPhP at 4 μg/L targeted phagosome and  lysosome activity, while 100 μg/L TPhP mainly affected carbohydrate metabolism,  muscular contraction and phagosome. Based on proteomic data, diverse bioassays  were employed to ascertain the effects of TPhP on specific proteins and pathways.  At gene and protein levels, expressions of critical visual proteins were  significantly changed by TPhP exposure, including retinoschisin 1a, opsins and  crystallins, implying the impairment of ocular development and function. TPhP  exposure at 100 μg/L also altered the abundances of diverse muscular proteins and  disordered the assembly of muscle fibers. Effects of TPhP on visual development  and motor activity may be combined to disturb larval swimming behavior. In  summary, current results provided mechanistic clues to the developmental  toxicities of TPhP. Future works are inspired to broaden the toxicological  knowledge of TPhP based on current proteomic results.},

However,  study results vary regarding data presentation and analysis and mostly focus on a  limited amount of the recorded data. In this study, we investigated whether  monitoring two behavioural outcomes (time and distance moved) together with  analysing multiple parameters can improve test sensitivity and data  interpretation. As a proof of principle 5-day old zebrafish (Danio rerio)  eleutheroembryos exposed to either endocrine disruptors (EDs) or acetylcholine  esterase (AChE) inhibitors were investigated. We analysed conventional parameters  such as mean and sum and implemented additional endpoints such as minimum or  maximum distance moved and new parameters assessing the bursting response of  eleutheroembryos. Furthermore, changes in eleutheroembryonic behaviour during the  moment of the light to dark transition were added. To improve data presentation  control-normalised results were displayed in radar charts, enabling the  simultaneous presentation of different parameters in relation to each other. This  enabled us to identify parameters most relevant to a certain behavioural  response. A cut off threshold using control data was applied to identify  parameters that were altered in a biological relevant manner. Our approach was  able to detect effects on different parameters that remained undetected when  analysis was done using conventional bar graphs on - in most cases analysed -  averaged, mean distance moved values. By combining the radar charts with  additional parameters and by using control-based thresholds, we were able to  increase the test sensitivity and promote a deeper understanding of the behaviour  response of zebrafish eleutheroembryos in the LDT test and thereby increased its  usability for behavioural toxicity studies.},

Previous studies  have compared zebrafish with mammalian models to determine similarities and  differences in locomotor behavior, learning and memory. Relatively little  research has been conducted on stress response and anxiety behavior as well as  the pharmacologic response in zebrafish. We have developed a test for zebrafish  to assess stress response and anxiety: the novel tank diving test. In this short  test normally zebrafish dive to the bottom of a novel tank and then gradually  over the 5-min test begin exploring higher levels of the tank. Nicotine, which  has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans was found to diminish this novel  tank diving response in zebrafish. The current study examined the nicotinic  receptor subtype selectivity involved in the actions of nicotine. Two nicotinic  receptor subtype selective antagonists were used: MLA (an alpha7 antagonist) and  DHbetaE (an alpha4beta2 antagonist). We replicated our previous finding of the  anxiolytic effect of nicotine with significantly less bottom dwelling by the fish  after nicotine treatment. This nicotine-induced anxiolytic effect was reversed by  both MLA and DHbetaE, indicating that both nicotinic alpha7 and alpha4beta2  receptors are involved in the nicotinic effect on anxiety in zebrafish.},

The Zn specificity of  Neo-Timm was evaluated with Zn chelants,  N,N,N',N'-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), sodium  diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), Zn sulfide washing solution, and hydrochloric  acid (HCl). Unfixed slices were also immersed in the fluorescent Zn probe  (zinpyr-1). Yellow-to-brown-to-black granules were revealed by Neo-Timm in the  zebrafish CNS. Telencephalon exhibited slightly stained regions, while  rhombencephalic structures showed high levels of staining. Although stained  granules were found on the cell bodies, rhombencephalic structures showed a  neuropil staining profile. The TPEN produced a mild reduction in Neo-Timm  staining, while HCl and mainly DEDTC abolished the staining, indicating a large  Zn content. This result was also confirmed by the application of a Zn probe.

Although the effect of cypermethrin on the embryonic stages of zebrafish is well characterized, its  toxic effect on the behaviour of adult zebrafish is largely unknown. Here we used  videogram and automated tracking approach to quantitatively assess behavioural  toxicity induced by the short exposure of cypermethrin to adult zebrafish. We  observed that cypermethrin at 25 ppb level induced behavioural toxicity in adult  zebrafish. Motor activity of the treated group was significantly retarded which  affected their overall exploratory behaviour including their visit to the central  arena of the open-field test. Furthermore, the treated group showed erratic  movements (covered less distance per unit time) without affecting their angle  based behavioural endpoints. In contrast to the control group, the cypermethrin  exposed group showed frequent freezing behaviour. However, their freezing  episodes were characterized by constant drift-like movement caused by the loss of  their voluntary control over the motor coordination. These behavioural changes  are similar to typical anxiety-like behaviour. Though, cypermethrin exposure at  ppb level for just half an hour was sufficient to induce behavioural toxicity, it  failed to alter brain superoxide dismutase and acetylcholine esterase enzyme  activity. Our data indicates that acute short-term exposure of cypermethrin  induces behavioural anomalies in adult zebrafish through a mechanism distinct  from alteration of brain superoxide dismutase and the acetylcholine esterase  activity.},

Here we show for the first time that exposure to endocrine  disrupting compounds (EDCs), including the pesticide tributyltin, two commercial  flame retardants, and a UV-filter chemical found in sunscreens, can perturb both  circadian clocks and lipid metabolism in vertebrates. Exposure of developing  zebrafish to EDCs affects core clock activity and leads to a remarkable increase  in lipid accumulation that is reminiscent of the effects observed for longdaysin,  a known disruptor of circadian rhythms. Our data reveal a novel obesogenic  mechanism of action for environmental chemicals, an observation which warrants  further research. Because circadian clocks regulate a wide variety of  physiological processes, identification of environmental chemicals capable of  perturbing these systems may provide important insights into the development of  environmentally-induced metabolic disease.},

A range  of concentrations was used to elucidate the median lethal concentration (LC(50))  of Quinalphos. Furthermore, embryos were exposed to two sub-lethal concentrations  LC(10) (0.66mg/L) and LC(20) (1.12mg/L) along with a median lethal concentration  (3.0mg/L) for 96h. Several morphological aberrations like lordosis, kyphosis,  scoliosis, heart edema, breaks in the neuronal tube and underdeveloped facial  parts were noticed, which were of concentration and time dependent. The QP has  adequately hindered hatching process during the course of exposure which was  upheld by the in silico docking studies with hatching enzyme, ZHE1. The length of  hatchlings at 96h in LC(50) concentration was significantly reduced to 47\%  compared to control. A significant pericardial effusion (5 to 16 fold) was  observed in {\textgreater}90\% of LC(50) treated groups. Morphological changes in heart lead to  the bradycardia, which ultimately leading to heart failure in some cases. The  swimming behavior was significantly diminished in relation to the inhibition of  AChE levels. From the in vitro kinetic studies, the kinetic constants K(m),  V(max) and inhibitory concentration K(i) (4.45×10(-5)M) was determined which  supported the competitive nature of QP.},

Molecular docking,  dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and in vitro experiments demonstrated that  TDCIPP could bind to the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor protein of  crucian carp and disturb the stimulation of growth hormone releasing hormone to  the expression of ghs, resulting in the decrease of the mRNA level of gh1 and gh2  in pituitary cells.

Whereas the etiology and  pathogenesis of PD is still poorly understood, studies in animal models are  providing important insights. One valuable type of animal model for PD is  established by treating animals with PD-inducing neurotoxins, including  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat.  These neurotoxins are thought to inhibit mitochondrial complex I activity leading  to oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, proteasomal dysfunction, and,  eventually, dopamine neuronal loss. However, the genes and pathways that underlie  the neurotoxicity of these agents are not known. In this study, we explored the  effect of MPTP, rotenone, and paraquat in both adult and larval zebrafish, which  are highly amenable to genetic analysis that can lead to the identification of  the underlying genes and pathways. Here, we report that adult zebrafish display  behavioral alterations, including decreased locomotor activity in response to  MPTP, whereas larval zebrafish exhibited developmental, behavioral, and DA  sensitivity to these agents. Taken together, these findings suggest that  zebrafish could be a valuable model for genetically dissecting the molecular  mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of PD-inducing agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to the commonly used dithiocarbamate (DTC) pesticides is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD), although  the mechanisms by which they exert their toxicity are not completely understood.  OBJECTIVE: We studied the mechanisms of ziram's (a DTC fungicide) neurotoxicity  in vivo. METHODS: Zebrafish (ZF) embryos were utilized to determine ziram's  effects on behavior, neuronal toxicity, and the role of synuclein in its  toxicity. RESULTS: Nanomolar-range concentrations of ziram caused selective loss  of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior. Because ziram  increases α-synuclein (α-syn) concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we  investigated the effect of ziram on ZF γ-synuclein 1 (γ1). ZF express 3 synuclein  isoforms, and ZF γ1 appears to be the closest functional homologue to α-syn. We  found that recombinant ZF γ1 formed fibrils in vitro, and overexpression of ZF γ1  in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity in a  manner similar to that of α-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF γ1 with morpholinos  and disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 prevented ziram's DA  toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ziram is selectively toxic to DA  neurons in vivo, and this toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings have  important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which pesticides may  cause PD.

	abstract = {The increased use of flammable plastics and electronic devices along with stricter fire safety standards has led to the heavy use of flame retardant  chemicals in many consumer, commercial, and industrial products. Although flame  retardant use has increased, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds their safety  with some evidence showing toxicity and risk to human and environmental health.  Recent efforts have focused on designing high-throughput biological platforms  with nonmammalian models to evaluate and prioritize chemicals with limited hazard  information. To complement these efforts, this study used a new morphological and  behavioral testing platform with embryonic zebrafish to characterize the  developmental toxicity of 44 halogenated and organophosphate flame retardants,  including several of their known metabolites. Zebrafish were exposed to flame  retardants from 6 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf) across concentrations  spanning 4 orders of magnitude (eg, 6.4 nM to 64 µM). Flame retardant effects on  survival and development were evaluated at 24 and 120 hpf, and neurobehavioral  changes were measured using 2 photomotor response (PMR) assays. Compared to  controls, 93\% (41/44) of flame retardants studied elicited adverse effects among  one or more of the bioassays and concentrations tested with the aryl phosphate  ester (APE)-based mono-isopropylated triaryl phosphate and the  brominated-bisphenol-A analog tetrabromobisphenol-A producing the greatest array  of malformations. Hierarchical clustering showed that APE flame retardants with  isopropyl, butyl, and cresyl substituents on phenyl rings clustered tightly and  were particularly potent. Both PMR assays were highly predictive of morphological  defects supporting their use as nonlethal means of evaluating teratogenicity that  could allow for additional evaluations of long-term or delayed effects in older  animals. Taken together, evidence presented here indicates that zebrafish  neurodevelopment is highly sensitive to many flame retardants currently in use  and can be used to understand potential vulnerabilities to human health.},

This study  presents a new approach for the investigation of predator-prey interactions  between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired  by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental  design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed,  (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect  by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on  exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 μg/l CHP. Previously, a  decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed.  However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant  differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an  impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP  concentration (1 μg/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were  observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in  higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk  assessment.},

Larval teratology, motor activity, motoneuron axonal  growth and muscle morphology were assessed at different developmental stages.  Results showed that DP exposure significantly altered embryonic spontaneous  movement, reduced touch-induced movement and free-swimming speed and decreased  swimming speed of larvae in response to dark stimulation. These changes occurred  at DP doses that resulted no significant teratogenesis in zebrafish.  Interestingly, in accord with these behavioral anomalies, DP exposure  significantly inhibited axonal growth of primary motoneuron and induced apoptotic  cell death and lesions in the muscle fibers of zebrafish. Furthermore, DP  exposure at 30 μg/L and 60 μg/L significantly increased reactive oxygen species  (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, as well as the mRNA transcript levels  of apoptosis-related genes bax and caspase-3.

We previously  demonstrated that the organophosphorus pesticide (OP) chlorpyrifos (CPF) inhibits  axonal growth in cultured neurons. In this study, we used a zebrafish model to  determine whether CPF, its oxon metabolite (CPFO), or the excreted metabolite  trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) alter spatiotemporal patterns of axonal growth in  vivo. Static waterborne exposure to CPFO, but not CPF or TCPy, at concentrations  ≥ 0.03 μM from 24- to 72-h post fertilization significantly inhibited  acetylcholinesterase, and high-performance liquid chromatography detected  significantly more TCPy in zebrafish exposed to 0.1 μM CPFO versus 1.0 μM CPF.  These data suggest that zebrafish lack the metabolic enzymes to activate CPF  during these early developmental stages. Consistent with this, CPFO, but not CPF,  significantly inhibited axonal growth of sensory neurons, primary motoneurons,  and secondary motoneurons at concentrations ≥ 0.1 μM. Secondary motoneurons were  the most sensitive to axonal growth inhibition by CPFO, which was observed at  concentrations that did not cause mortality, gross developmental defects, or  aberrant somatic muscle differentiation. CPFO effects on axonal growth correlated  with adverse effects on touch-induced swimming behavior, suggesting the  functional relevance of these structural changes. These data suggest that altered  patterns of neuronal connectivity contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity  of CPF and demonstrate the relevance of zebrafish as a model for studying OP  developmental neurotoxicity.},

Recently, extensive  research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays.  However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF  to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were  evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and  96hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal  malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No  significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control  occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96h. The hatching  process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with  increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for  the test compound with 96-h EC(50) of 256microgL(-1) for pericardial edema, and  109microgL(-1) for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that  zebrafish larvae of 96hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to  50, 100, and 200microgL(-1) from 3 to 84hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free  embryo medium for one more day till 120hpf, larvae from the 50microgL(-1)group  seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour  compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were  exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse  transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were  significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150microgL(-1) BF for 72h,  indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed  that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after  short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the  individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their  ecological fitness.},

FM 550 leaches from items such as foam-based  furniture and infant products, resulting in contamination of the household  environment and biota. Previous studies indicate sex-specific behavioral deficits  in rodents and zebrafish in response to developmental FM 550 exposure. These  deficits include impacts on social and attachment behaviors in a prosocial  rodent: the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). The prairie vole is a  laboratory-acclimated rodent that exhibits spontaneous attachment behaviors  including pair bonding. Here we extend previous work by addressing how  developmental exposure to FM 550 impacts pair bonding strength via an  extended-time partner preference test, as well as neuron electrophysiological  properties in a region implicated in pair bond behavior, the nucleus accumbens  (NAcc) core. Dams were exposed to vehicle or 1000 μg of FM 550 via subcutaneous  injections throughout gestation, and female and male pups were directly exposed  beginning the day after birth until weaning. Pair bond behavior of adult female  and male offspring was assessed using a three hour-long partner preference test.  Afterwards, acute brain slices of the NAcc core were produced and medium spiny  neuron electrophysiological attributes recorded via whole cell patch-clamp.  Behavioral impacts were sex-specific. Partner preference behavior was increased  in exposed females but decreased in exposed males. Electrophysiological impacts  were similar between sexes and specific to attributes related to input  resistance. Input resistance was decreased in neurons recorded from both sexes  exposed to FM 550 compared to vehicle. This study supports the hypothesis that  developmental exposure to FM 550 impacts attachment behaviors and demonstrates a  novel FM 550 effect on neural electrophysiology.},

Within this  study, 5-azacytidine (5-azaC, a DNMT inhibitor) was used as a positive control.  Although 5-azaC significantly inhibited zebrafish DNMT, TDCIPP did not affect  DNMT activity in vitro at concentrations as high as 500 μM. However, rapid  embryonic uptake of 5-azaC and TDCIPP from 0.75 to 2 hpf resulted in chemical-  and chromosome-specific alterations in cytosine methylation at 2 hpf. Moreover,  TDCIPP exposure predominantly resulted in hypomethylation of positions outside of  CpG islands and within intragenic (exon) regions of the zebrafish genome.  Overall, these findings provide the foundation for monitoring DNA methylation  dynamics within zebrafish as well as identifying potential associations among  TDCIPP exposure, adverse health outcomes, and DNA methylation status within human  populations.},

Profiles of responses of  concentrations of E2 in plasma and expressions of genes along the HPGL axis genes  were different between the two times of sampling. Concentrations of E2 were less,  and abundances of mRNA for several genes along the HPGL axis were significantly  greater or lesser when samples were collected at 7:00 PM than they were when  samples were collected at 8:00 AM. Exposure to three concentrations of PCZ (3, 30  or 300μg/L) for 48h resulted in significantly lesser concentrations of plasma E2  and caused compensatory up-regulation of genes included in hypothalamus,  pituitary and ovary. Expressions of genes along the HPGL were more responsive to  PCZ at 8:00 AM than they were when samples were collected at 7:00 PM.  Correlations among parameters in samples collected at the two times indicated the  effects might be due to different concentrations of E2 in plasma due to exposure  to PCZ.},

In this study,  Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12V)), referred as kras transgenic zebrafish  which was shown to be an inducible liver tumor model, was applied as experimental  model to assess the promotion potential of TDCIPP for HCC in males. In brief,  kras males were exposed to 20 mg/L doxycycline (DOX), 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP and a  binary mixture of 20 mg/L DOX with 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, and after exposure liver  size, histopathology and transcriptional profiles of liver from these treatments  were examined. With the involvement of TDCIPP, the liver size was significantly  increased and the lesion of hepatocyte became more aggressive. Furthermore,  expressions of genes involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were  simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the solvent  control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two chemicals compared  to the single DOX treatment. Overall, our results suggested that TDCIPP had  promotion effect on the progression of liver tumor in kras males.},

In three urban, fish-bearing waterways of British Columbia, Canada, we found the active ingredients of WeedEx, KillEx,  and Roundup herbicide formulations (2,4-D, dicamba, glyphosate, and mecoprop) at  low to high ng/L concentrations (0.26 to 309 ng/L) in routine conditions, i.e.,  no rain for at least one week. Following rain, these concentrations increased by  an average of eightfold, suggesting runoff as a major route of herbicide  introduction in these waterways. To determine whether fish might be able to limit  point-source exposures through sensory-driven behaviors, we introduced pulses of  representative herbicide mixtures to individual adult zebrafish (a model species)  in flow-through tanks. Fish did the opposite of limit exposure; they chose to  spend more time in pulses of herbicide mixtures representative of those that may  occur with rain events. This attraction response was not altered by a previous  4-d exposure to lower concentrations of the mixtures, suggesting fish will not  learn from previous exposures. However, previous exposures did alter an  attraction response to an amino acid prevalent in food (L-alanine). The present  study demonstrates that fish living within urban waterways may elect to place  themselves in herbicide-contaminated environments and that these exposures may  alter their behavioral responses to cues necessary for survival.},

Acute and subacute toxicities of RDX have been relatively well  documented in terrestrial vertebrates, but among aquatic vertebrates the  information available is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize  the acute toxicity of RDX to larval zebrafish. Mortality (LC50) and incidence of  vertebral column deformities (EC50) were two of the end points measured in this  study. The 96-h LC50 was estimated at 22.98 and 25.64 mgl(-1) in two different  tests. The estimated no-observed-effective-concentration (NOEC) values of RDX on  lethality were 13.27+/-0.05 and 15.32+/-0.30 mgl(-1); and the  lowest-observed-effective-concentration (LOEC) values were 16.52+/-0.05 and  19.09+/-0.23 mgl(-1) in these two tests, respectively. The 96-h EC50 for  vertebral deformities on survivors from one of the acute lethality tests was  estimated at 20.84 mgl(-1), with NOEC and LOEC of 9.75+/-0.34 and 12.84+/-0.34  mgl(-1), respectively. Behavioral aberrations were also noted in this acute  toxicity study, including the occurrence of whirling movement and lethargic  behavior. The acute effects of RDX on survival, incidence of deformities, and  behavior of larval zebrafish occurred at the high end of the most frequently  reported concentrations of RDX in aquatic environments.

Studied pesticides alone and in  combination caused depletion of total antioxidant capacity and cellular thiols,  overproduction of ROS, accumulation of oxidative lesions and elevated DNA damage  in zebrafish liver. Notably, low concentration of Roundup induced a hormesis-like  effect by stimulating the protective cellular mechanisms. Chlorpyrifos showed  stronger prooxidant effects than Roundup and additionally caused nitrosative and  carbonyl stress in zebrafish. At the organismal level, studied pesticides and  their mixtures induced hepato- and neurotoxicity. The effects of the studied  pesticides on biomarkers of apoptosis, endocrine disruption and immune disorders  were generally weak and inconsistent. The multibiomarker assessment showed that  chlorpyrifos is considerably more toxic than Roundup to zebrafish. The toxic  effects of the pesticide mixtures were mostly driven by chlorpyrifos, with  minimal or mitigating effects of Roundup addition. These findings elucidate the  toxic mechanisms of common pesticides in a model vertebrate and demonstrate that  health hazards of pesticide mixtures cannot be predicted from the effects of  single pesticides.},

According to results, MZ was able to induce morphological  abnormalities such as body axis distortion, DNA damage, cell death, increased ROS  generation and changes in behavioral endpoints during zebrafish development. All  these toxic effects were inhibited by the pre-treatment with NAC indicating a key  role of redox unbalance during MZ-induced embryotoxicity.

For this aim, zebrafish embryos were continually exposed, from 0.5 to 144 h  post-fertilization, to a range of concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 µM). IMA  (0 to 672 µM) were also applied to the whole-blood cultures from two persons. We  used chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronucleus (MN) tests to examine DNA  damage by IMA in human peripheral lymphocytes. The fungicide significantly  altered zebrafish development even at low concentrations and its effects were  dose-dependent. Results of the experiment indicated that IMA concentrations of 10  µM and above negatively affected embryo survival and hatching success.  Morphological analysis uncovered a large suite of abnormalities such as less  melanin pigmentation, wavy notochord, crooked trunk, tail defect and cardiac  edema. The cytogenetic results clearly showed that IMA caused increases of the  frequencies of the structural chromosomal aberrations and the rates of MN as  compared to controls in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, the present  findings are of importance in the assessment of the potential risk of fungicides  as IMA on aquatic ecosystems and humans.},

Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis  showed that exposure to TPHP reduced the protein levels of TUBB3 and SYP in the  synapses of hippocampal neurons. TPHP exposure also downregulated the gene  expression of neurotransmitter receptors including Grins, Htr1α, and Adra1α in a  dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, the calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis  governed by synaptic vesicle proteins STX1A and SYT1 was inhibited in the  TPHP-treated hippocampus. Our results reveal that TPHP exposure causes abnormal  learning and memory behaviors by disturbing synaptogenesis and neurotransmission.},

	abstract = {The use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been banned for several decades. PCBs have a long biological half-life and high liposolubility which leads to  their bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food chains over a wide range  of trophic levels. Exposure can lead to changes in animal physiology and behavior  and has been demonstrated in both experimental and field analyses. There are also  potential risks to high trophic level predators, including humans. A maternal  transfer has been demonstrated in fish as PCBs bind to lipids in eggs. In this  study, behavioral traits (exploration and free swimming, with or without  challenges) of contaminated zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults and their offspring  (both as five-day-old larvae and as two-month-old fish reared under standard  conditions) were measured using video-tracking. Long-term dietary exposure to a  mixture of non-coplanar PCBs was used to mimic known environmental contamination  levels and congener composition. Eight-week-old fish were exposed for eight  months at 26-28 °C. Those exposed to an intermediate dose (equivalent to that  found in the Loire Estuary, ∑(CB)=515 ng g⁻¹ dry weight in food) displayed  behavioral disruption in exploration capacities. Fish exposed to the highest dose  (equivalent to that found in the Seine Estuary, ∑(CB)=2302 ng g⁻¹ dry weight in  food) displayed an increased swimming activity at the end of the night. In  offspring, larval activity was increased and two-month-old fish occupied the  bottom section of the tank less often. These findings call for more long-term  experiments using the zebrafish model; the mechanisms underlying behavioral  disruptions need to be understood due to their implications for both human health  and their ecological relevance in terms of individual fitness and survival.},

Rat models have been key in  demonstrating that prenatal CPF exposure causes choice accuracy deficits and  motor alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary nonmammalian  models can be useful in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the  persisting behavioral effects of developmental CPF exposure. Zebrafish with their  clear chorion and extensive developmental information base provide an excellent  model for assessment of molecular processes of toxicant impacted  neurodevelopment. To facilitate the use of the zebrafish model and to compare it  to the more typical rodent models, the behavioral phenotype of CPF toxicity in  zebrafish must be well characterized. Our laboratory has developed methods for  assessing spatial discrimination learning in zebrafish, which can differentiate  response latency from choice accuracy in a three chambered fish tank. Low and  high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml on days 1-5 postfertilization) both had  significant persisting effects on both spatial discrimination and response  latency over 18 weeks of testing. The high, but not the low dose, significantly  accelerated mortality rates of the fish during the study from 20-38 weeks of age.  Developmental exposure to either 10 or 100 ng/ml of CPF caused significant  spatial discrimination impairments in zebrafish when they were adults. The  impairment caused by 10 ng/ml was seen during early but not later testing, while  the impairment caused by 100 ng/ml became more pronounced with continued testing.  The higher dose caused a more pervasive impairment. The 10 and 100 ng/ml doses  had opposite effects on response latency. The low 10 ng/ml dose significantly  slowed response latency, while the high 100 ng/ml dose significant increased  response latency. Both of these effects diminished with continued testing. CPF  exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments, which  lasted throughout adulthood in zebrafish. The molecular mechanisms by which early  developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral impairments expressed in  adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish model.},

Thus, neurobehavioral tests using in  vivo models (e.g., zebrafish embryo) have been proposed as complementary  approaches. To investigate the specificity and sensitivity of a light-dark  transition locomotor response (LMR) test in 4 to 5 days post fertilization  zebrafish with respect to different modes of action (MoAs), we analyzed a set of  18 environmentally relevant compounds with various anticipated MoAs. We found  that exposure-induced behavioral alterations were reproducible and dependent on  concentration and time. Comparative and quantitative analyses of the obtained  locomotor patterns revealed that behavioral effects were not restricted to  compounds primarily known to target the nervous system. A clear distinction of  MoAs based on locomotor patterns was not possible for most compounds.  Furthermore, chemicals with an anticipated same MoA did not necessarily provoke  similar behavioral phenotypes. Finally, we determined an increased sensitivity  (≥10-fold) compared to observed mortality in the LMR assay for five of eight  neuroactive chemicals as opposed to non-neuroactive compounds.},

This study aims to  assess short-term toxicity of rotenone to early-life stages of the fish Danio  rerio and Poecilia reticulata using a wide and integrative range of biomarkers  (developmental, biochemical, behavioral, and histopathological). Moreover, the  species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach was used to compare rotenone  acute toxicity to fish species. Toxicity tests were based on the OECD protocols,  fish embryo toxicity test (for D. rerio embryos), and fish acute toxicity test  (for P. reticulata juveniles). D. rerio embryos were used to estimate lethal  concentrations and analyze embryonic and enzymatic alterations (activity of  catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cholinesterase), while P. reticulata  juveniles were used for the assessment of histological damage in the gills and  liver. Rotenone induced significant mortality in zebrafish embryos with a 96-h  lethal concentration 50\% (LC50) = 12.2 μg/L. Rotenone was embryotoxic, affecting  the development of D. rerio embryos, which showed cardiac edema; tail  deformities; loss of equilibrium; and a general delay characterized by lack of  tail detachment, delayed somite formation, yolk sac absorption, and lack of  pigmentation. Biochemical biomarker inhibition was observed for concentrations ≥1  μg/L for CAT and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and for cholinesterase (ChE) in  concentration from 10 μg/L. Behavioral changes were observed for P. reticulata  juveniles exposed to concentrations equal to or above 25 μg/L of rotenone;  moreover, histological damage in the liver and gills of fish exposed to  concentrations equal to or above 2.5 μg/L could be observed. A hazard  concentration 5\% (HC5) of 3.2 μg/L was estimated considering the acute toxicity  data for different fish species (n = 49). Lethal and sublethal effects of  rotenone raise a concern about its effects on nontarget fish species, especially  because rotenone and its metabolite rotenolone are frequently reported in the  microgram range in natural environments for several days after field  applications. Rotenone should be used with caution. Given the high toxicity and  wide range of sublethal effects here reported, further studies in a chronic  exposure scenario are recommended.},

Rat  models have been key in demonstrating that developmental CPF exposure causes  learning deficits and locomotor activity alterations, which persist into  adulthood.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) with their clear chorion and extensive developmental  information base provide an excellent model for assessment of molecular processes  of toxicant-impacted neurodevelopment. We have developed methods for assessing  spatial discrimination learning in adult zebrafish and have documented persisting  effects of developmental CPF exposure on swimming activity and learning after low  and high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml) administered to zebrafish embryos on  Days 1-5 postfertilization (pf). In the current study, we developed methods for  behavioral assessment of CPF exposure on swimming activity in newly hatched  zebrafish. An equal area segmented annular grid (concentric circles divided into  quadrants through the diameter) was made in a 16-mm diameter cylinder. The test  area was placed on a heating device secured to an Olympus SZH10 dissecting scope  stage. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 10 ng/ml CPF, 100 ng/ml CPF, or vehicle  control (25 microl/ml DMSO) (n=8-10/treatment group). Each treatment group was  kept in a total volume of 25 ml of egg water (60 mg/ml Instant Ocean) including  DMSO with or without CPF mixed to above dilutions in an incubator set at 28.5  degrees C. CPF dilutions or vehicle were changed daily with exposure ending on  Day 5 pf. Testing of larval zebrafish was performed on Days 6 and 9 pf. The fish  were placed in the test cylinder with 1.5 ml of egg H(2)O (28.5 degrees C). After  a 2-min acclimation period, the swimming activity of the fish was measured for a  3-min testing session. The 100 ng/ml CPF dose caused significant slowing of  swimming activity on Days 6 and 9 pf and had persisting effects of impairing  spatial discrimination and decreasing response latency in adulthood.  Developmental exposure to 10 ng/ml of CPF did not cause a significant change in  locomotor activity during the period soon after hatching. CPF exposure during  early development caused clear behavioral impairments detectable during the  posthatching period. In a previous study, we found that early developmental CPF  exposure caused behavioral alterations in zebrafish, which lasted throughout  adulthood. The molecular mechanisms by which early developmental CPF exposure  produces these behavioral impairments expressed in adulthood can now be studied  in the zebrafish model.},

Five-month-old zebrafish were exposed to metolachlor and  S-metolachlor for 28 days, then transferred to clean water and purified for  7 days. In the uptake phase, S-metolachlor was preferentially accumulated at low  concentrations, while metolachlor was preferentially accumulated at high  concentrations. The two chemicals were metabolized by {\textgreater}70\% in zebrafish on the  first day and showed same metabolic process. At the accumulation endpoint,  S-metolachlor had no significant inhibitory effect on the enzymes activities of  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)  and developmental indicators of zebrafish. However, 300 μg/L metolachlor  significantly inhibited the enzymes activities of SOD, CAT and GST and affected  the liver development. The preferential enrichment of metolachlor at the high  concentration may be the reason for its higher toxicity to zebrafish. Further  research demonstrated that metolachlor significantly altered the expression of  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis-related genes, including gnrh2, gnrh3,  lhβ, 17βhsd and cyp19a, thereby reducing the levels of testosterone (T) in  females and sex hormones (estradiol and testosterone) in males. S-metolachlor  increased the levels of estradiol (E2) in females by altering the expression of  HPG axis-related genes such as fshβ, cyp17, 17βhsd and cyp19a. The mechanism of  metolachlor and S-metolachlor on the endocrine disrupting effects of zebrafish is  different, which may be sex-specific. 7 days after transferring the exposed  zebrafish to clean water, most of the enzymes activities, sex hormone levels and  related gene expression levels returned to normal, which may be related to the  rapid metabolism of the two chemicals.},

In earlier  work zebrafish were used as a complementary model to study mechanisms of  CPF-induced neurotoxicity induced during early development. We found that  developmental (first five days after fertilization) chlorpyrifos exposure  significantly impaired learning in zebrafish. However, this testing was time and  labor intensive. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that persisting  effects of developmental chlorpyrifos could be detected with a brief automated  assessment of startle response and that this behavioral index could be used to  help determine the neurobehavioral mechanisms for persisting CPF effects. The  swimming activity of adult zebrafish was assessed by a computerized  video-tracking device after a sudden tap to the test arena. Ten consecutive  trials (1/min) were run to determine startle response and its habituation.  Additionally, habituation recovery trials were run at 8, 32 and 128 min after the  end of the initial trial set. CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p{\textless}0.025)  greater overall startle response during the 10-trial session compared to controls  (group sizes: Control N=40, CPF N=24). During the initial recovery period (8 min)  CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p{\textless}0.01) greater startle response  compared to controls. To elucidate the contributions of nicotinic and muscarinic  acetylcholine receptors to developmental CPF-mediated effects, the effects of  developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure throughout the first five days  after fertilization were determined. Developmental nicotine and pilocarpine  exposure significantly increased startle response, though nicotine (group sizes:  Control N=32, 15 mM N=12, 25 mM N=20) was much more potent than pilocarpine  (group sizes: Control N=20, 100 microM N=16, 1000 microM N=12). Neither was as  potent as CPF for developmental exposure increasing startle response in  adulthood. Lastly, developmental CPF exposure decreased dopamine and serotonin  levels and increased transmitter turnover in developing zebrafish larvae (N=4  batches of 50 embryos/treatment). Only the decline in dopamine concentrations  persisted into adulthood (group sizes: Control N=14, CPF N=13). This study shows  that a quick automated test of startle can detect persisting neurobehavioral  impairments caused by developmental exposure to CPF. This may be helpful in  screening for persisting neurobehavioral defects from a variety of toxicants.},

	abstract = {At ecosystems level, environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and intensity of UV radiation (UVR) have an important role  on the efficiency of organisms' physiological and behavioral performances and  consequently on the capacity of response to contaminants. Insignificant  alterations of these parameters may compromise this response. In addition, these  parameters can additionally alter chemical compounds by inducing their  degradation, producing thereafter other metabolites. Understanding the combined  effects of chemicals and environmental parameters is absolutely necessary for an  adequate prediction of risk in aquatic environments. According to this scenario,  this work aims at studying the combined toxicity of UVR and three xenobiotics:  the biocide triclosan (TCS), the metal chromium (as potassium dichromate, PD) and  the fungicide prochloraz (PCZ). To achieve this goal zebrafish (Danio rerio)  embryos (3h post fertilization (hpf)) were exposed to several concentrations of  each chemical combined with different UV intensities; mortality and eggs were  recorded every 24h for the all test duration (96 h). Results showed different  response patterns depending on the toxicant, stress levels and duration of  exposure. The combination of UVR and TCS indicated a dose ratio deviation where  synergism was observed when UVR was the dominant stressor (day 2). The  combination of UVR and PD presented a dose level dependency at day 3 indicating  antagonism at low stress levels, changing with time where at day 4, a dose ratio  deviation showed statistically that synergism occurred at higher PD  concentrations. Finally, UVR combined with PCZ indicated a dose ratio at day 3  and dose level deviation at day 4 of exposure, suggesting a synergistic response  when PCZ is the dominant stressor in the combination. The obtained results in  this study highlighted the importance of taking into account the possible  interaction of stressors and time of exposure to better predict environmental  risk.},

However, its effect on fish behavior and the underlying mechanisms are still  unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of broflanilide on the zebrafish  brain over a 96-h exposure by comparing the histopathological changes and  relative expression of targeted genes with the behavioral metrics. The results of  the toxicity test showed that broflanilide could cause deformities, such as  deformation of the operculum and spinal curvature, at 0.6, 0.82 and 1.15 mg/L.  Results also showed tissue damage and apoptosis in the cerebellum under 0.27 and  0.6 mg/L exposure. Additionally, broflanilide affected the neurotransmitters,  metabolites and transcripts of genes associated with dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric  acid expression. and the signaling pathways in zebrafish brains at 0.60 mg/L  after 1 h and 96 h of exposure, while the levels of glutamate, glutamate  decarboxylase, GABA transaminase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were also inhibited at 0.27 mg/L after 96 h of  exposure. The accumulated swimming distance was significantly longer and the  average speed was significantly faster than the control at 0.27 and 0.6 mg/L  after 1-h of exposure, while these metrics were lowered at 0.6 mg/L after 96 h of  exposure. The study results demonstrates that broflanilide affects the zebrafish  brain, neurotransmitters and associated fish behaviors. This study also provides  deeper insight into the mechanistic understanding of the effects of broflanilide  on the zebrafish brain.},

First, during 135min of free swimming, larvae that had been exposed to 2ppm, 5ppm  or 10ppm A1254 exhibited enhanced thigmotaxis (edge preference) relative to  control larvae. Second, during the immediately ensuing 15-min visual startle  assay, the 5ppm and 10ppm PCB-exposed larvae reacted differently to a visual  threat, a red 'bouncing' disk, relative to control larvae. These results are  consistent with the anxiogenic and attention-disrupting effects of PCB exposure  documented in children, monkeys and rodents and merit further investigation.},

The  enantioselective toxicity of oxathiapiprolin showed that the toxicity of  R-oxathiapiprolin was 1.8-2.1 times higher than that of S-oxathiapiprolin toward  the two aquatic plants. In particular, the content of photosynthetic pigments  decreased significantly stronger after exposure to R-oxathiapiprolin compared  with S-oxathiapiprolin. The LC(50) values of R-oxathiapiprolin in zebrafish in  the different life stages were 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of  S-oxathiapiprolin. The zebrafish embryos were most sensitive to the  oxathiapiprolin enantiomers. After exposure to R-oxathiapiprolin, zebrafish  embryos showed noticeable hatching delays, inhibition or deformation.  R-oxathiapiprolin degraded preferentially in all four soils, with an enantiomeric  fraction (EF) ranging from 0.28 to 0.42 under aerobic conditions.  Enantioselective degradation was not found under anaerobic and sterilized  conditions. The enantioselectivity of new chiral pesticides should be fully  considered in risk assessments to provide a basis for the development and  preparation of pure optical enantiomers.},

In  this study, kras(V12) genetically modified zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2;  TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12V)), a model system in which liver tumors can be induced by  doxycycline (DOX), was used to evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of  TDCIPP. Briefly, kras(V12) transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP,  20 mg/L DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver  size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were determined.  Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the  presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella  infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an  occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the  amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic  zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under  the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the binary exposure of DOX  and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory  response inhibitor (ketoprofen) significantly decrease the liver size and the  amounts of neutrophils in the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish  larvae. Collectively, our results suggested that TDCIPP could promote the liver  tumor progression by induction of hepatic inflammatory responses.},

The present study examined the effects of chronic (28 days) aqueous  exposure of chiral penflufen (rac-penflufen, R-(-)-penflufen and  S-(+)-penflufen), a widely used fungicide, with/without cadmium (Cd), a highly  toxic heavy metal in zebrafish (Danio rerio). After rac-penflufen individual or  combined exposure with Cd, the bioaccumulation and residual levels of  S-(+)-penflufen were significantly higher than R-(-)-penflufen, and the effects  of Cd were insignificantly. But for penflufen enantiomer, the effects of Cd were  more serious for R-(-)-penflufen, which could increase the bioaccumulation (up  to1.73 times), inhibit the dissipation (up to 32.3\%) and enhance the residue (up  to 5.35 times) of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, decreasing the  enantioselectivity. However, significant increase of S-(+)-penflufen  concentrations was only found in viscera under co-exposure of Cd. The tissue  distribution of penflufen enantiomers were not affected by the presence of Cd,  and no interconversion of the two enantiomers occurred regardless of the presence  of Cd. These findings indicated that co-contamination with Cd could increase the  persistence of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, thus increasing the environmental  risks. The significant differences of Cd effects on chiral pesticide enantiomer  and racemate indicated that the combined pollution of heavy metal and chiral  pesticide might have enantiomer-specific, which should raise concern, and the  enantioselective mechanism deserve further study.},

In a parallel series of studies with  zebrafish, we have also found persisting behavioral dysfunction after  developmental CPF exposure. We have developed a battery of measures of zebrafish  behavior, which are reliable and sensitive to toxicant-induced damage. This study  determined the critical duration of developmental CPF exposure for causing  persisting neurobehavioral effects. Tests of sensorimotor response (tap startle  response and habituation), stress response (novel tank diving test) and learning  (3-chamber tank spatial discrimination) were conducted with adult zebrafish after  early developmental CPF exposure. The CPF exposure level was 100 ng/ml with  durations of 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 and 0-5 days after fertilization. Developmental  CPF exposure had persisting behavioral effects in zebrafish tested as adults. In  the tactile startle test, CPF exposed fish showed decreased habituation to  startle and a trend toward increased overall startle response. In the novel tank  exploration test, exposed fish showed decreased escape diving response and  increased swimming activity. In the 3-chamber learning test, the 0-5 day CPF  exposure group had a significantly lower learning rate. There was evidence for  persisting declines in brain dopamine and norepinepherine levels after  developmental CPF exposure. In all of the measures the clearest persistent  effects were seen in fish exposed for the full duration of five days after  fertilization. In a follow-up experiment there were some indications for  persisting behavioral effects after exposure during only the later phase of this  developmental window. This study demonstrated the selective long-term  neurobehavioral alterations caused by exposure to CPF in zebrafish. The zebrafish  model can facilitate the determination of the molecular mechanisms underlying  long-term neurobehavioral impairment after developmental toxicant exposure.},

The  median lethal concentration values of (1S, 5R)-metconazole, (1R, 5S)-metconazole,  and the mixture of them against zebrafish were 4.01, 2.61 and 3.17 mg⋅L(-1),  respectively. (1R, 5S)-Metconazole was preferentially bioaccumulated in zebrafish  than (1S, 5R)-metconazole, and the bioconcentration factor of (1R,  5S)-metconazole was 1.28-fold larger than that of (1S, 5R)-metconazole. Then, the  activity order of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S transferase  enzymes in zebrafish was expressed as (1S, 5R)-metconazole {\textgreater} the mixture {\textgreater} (1R,  5S)-metconazole, while the order of malondialdehyde content in zebrafish was (1R,  5S)-metconazole {\textgreater} the mixture {\textgreater} (1S, 5R)-metconazole. Moreover, cis-metconazole  exhibited enantioselective regulation effects on the levels of triiodothyronine  and thyroxine in zebrafish, and (1R, 5S)-metconazole possessed stronger thyroid  disruption ability to zebrafish than the others. By virtue of molecular docking  methodology, the binding affair and docking energy results supported that  interactions between (1R, 5S)-metconazole and thyroid hormone receptors were much  stronger than those between (1S, 5R)-metconazole and same receptors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the possibility of using a mixture of three fungal toxins produced by Ascochyta caulina as a bioherbicide to control  noxious weeds. However, to assess the commercial potential of this new  bioherbicide, it is necessary to increase knowledge regarding the environmental  behaviour of these toxins, and particularly their effects on non-target  organisms. A negative ecotoxicological profile of this potential bioherbicide  could eventually hinder its registration. RESULTS: In this study, acute and  chronic effects of the A. caulina toxins (ACTs) on non-target organisms were  evaluated in the laboratory. The (96 h) calculated algal Er C50 and NOEC were  142.7 and {\textless}12.5 mg L(-1) respectively. For daphnids, the EC50 (48 h, acute test)  was 20.1 mg L(-1) , whereas the NOEC (21 day chronic reproduction test) was  6.3 µg L(-1) . No cases of mortality, sublethal effects or abnormalities were  observed in the acute and chronic tests for Brachydanio rerio at a concentration  of 100 mg L(-1) , indicating a low toxicity of ACTs for this organism. The  calculated LC50 (14 days, acute test) and NOEC (56 day chronic reproduction) for  earthworms were {\textgreater}1000 and ≥250 mg kg(-1) soil respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The  present study has provided baseline information needed to assess the potential  hazard of the fungal toxins of A. caulina. In particular, the acute and chronic  effects on aquatic (algae, Daphnia and fish) and terrestrial organisms  (earthworms) have been highlighted. Finally, a comparison of the inherent  toxicity of ACTs with other synthetic herbicides has shown comparative  ecotoxicity of the tested mixture.},

However, the complicated process and high cost limit widespread use in  agriculture, so a simpler and more convenient preparation system is urgently  needed. Meanwhile, under complex field conditions, the advantageous mechanism of  the nanosize effect and sustained release have no quantitative and detailed  study. In this study, a reactive emulsifier (OP-10) is used to participate in the  interfacial polymerization of the nanoemulsion, and polymer nanocapsules loaded  with lambda-cyhalothrin (NCS@LC) are quickly and easily prepared to study the  efficacy and synergistic mechanism of foliar pest control. As a result, the  nanocapsule is about 150 nm with a stable core-shell structure. The nanoscale  state increases the distribution and adhesion of the particles on the leaf  surface, which increases the contact efficiency of pesticides under the different  physiological stages and behavioral activities of the target organism. The shell  structure provides sustained release characteristics and increases the UV  resistance by about 2.5 times for pesticides. Compared with microcapsules loaded  with lambda-cyhalothrin (CS@LC), NCS@LC not only shows rapid and synergistic  insecticidal efficacy but also provides sustained insecticidal efficacy. The  mortality of NCS is 3.4 times that of the nanosized emulsion in water (NEW) at  the lowest concentration (0.5 mg L(-1)), and the control efficacy remained 77.3\%  after 7 days. Compared with NEW, NCS@LC provides excellent field efficacy, while  LC(50) for zebrafish is only 0.68 times without increasing the aquatic toxicity  risk.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of chronic or delayed toxicity resulting from the exposure to sublethal chemical concentrations is an increasing concern in environmental risk  assessment. The Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test with zebrafish provides a  reliable prediction of acute toxicity in adult fish, but it cannot yet be applied  to predict the occurrence of chronic or delayed toxicity. Identification of  sublethal FET endpoints that can assist in predicting the occurrence of chronic  or delayed toxicity would be advantageous. The present study characterized the  occurrence of delayed toxicity in zebrafish larvae following early exposure to  PCB126, previously described to cause delayed effects in the common sole. The  first aim was to investigate the occurrence and temporal profiles of delayed  toxicity during zebrafish larval development and compare them to those previously  described for sole to evaluate the suitability of zebrafish as a model fish  species for delayed toxicity assessment. The second aim was to examine the  correlation between the sublethal endpoints assessed during embryonal and early  larval development and the delayed effects observed during later larval  development. After exposure to PCB126 (3-3000ng/L) until 5 days post  fertilization (dpf), larvae were reared in clean water until 14 or 28 dpf.  Mortality and sublethal morphological and behavioural endpoints were recorded  daily, and growth was assessed at 28 dpf. Early life exposure to PCB126 caused  delayed mortality (300 ng/L and 3000 ng/L) as well as growth impairment and  delayed development (100 ng/L) during the clean water period. Effects on swim  bladder inflation and cartilaginous tissues within 5 dpf were the most promising  for predicting delayed mortality and sublethal effects, such as decreased  standard length, delayed metamorphosis, reduced inflation of swim bladder and  column malformations. The EC50 value for swim bladder inflation at 5 dpf (169  ng/L) was similar to the LC50 value at 8 dpf (188 and 202 ng/L in two  experiments). Interestingly, the patterns of delayed mortality and delayed  effects on growth and development were similar between sole and zebrafish. This  indicates the comparability of critical developmental stages across divergent  fish species such as a cold water marine flatfish and a tropical freshwater  cyprinid. Additionally, sublethal effects in early embryo-larval stages were  found promising for predicting delayed lethal and sublethal effects of PCB126.  Therefore, the proposed method with zebrafish is expected to provide valuable  information on delayed mortality and delayed sublethal effects of chemicals and  environmental samples that may be extrapolated to other species.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a modulatory role in cognition, and zebrafish provide a preclinical model to study learning  and memory. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of nicotine (NIC) and some new  cytisine-derived partial agonists (CC4 and CC26) on spatial memory in zebrafish  using a rapid assay on T-maze task. The role of α4/α6β2 and the α7 nAChRs in  NIC-induced memory enhancement was evaluated using selective nAChR antagonists.  RESULTS: Low and high doses of NIC, cytisine (CYT), CC4 and CC26 respectively  improved and worsened the mean running time, showing an inverted U dose-response  function. The effective dose (ED50) (×10⁻⁵ mg/kg) was 0.4 for CC4, 4.5 for CYT,  140 for NIC and 200 for CC26. NIC-induced cognitive enhancement was reduced by  the selective nAChR subtype antagonists: methyllycaconitine (MLA) for α7,  α-conotoxin (MII) for α6β2, dihydro-β-erythroidine (DhβE) for α4β2, the  nonselective antagonist mecamylamine (MEC) and the muscarinic antagonist  scopolamine (SCOP), with DhβE being more active than MLA or MII. All the partial  agonists blocked the cognitive enhancement. The improvement with the maximal  active dose of each partial agonist was blocked by low doses of DhβE (0.001  mg/kg) and MII (0.01 mg/kg). MLA reduced the effects of CC26 and CC4 at doses of  0.01 and 1 mg/kg, respectively, but did not antagonize CYT-induced memory  improvement at any of the tested dose. No change in swimming activity was  observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that zebrafish make a useful  model for the rapid screening of the effect of new α4β2 nAChR compounds on  spatial memory.},

	abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most common agricultural herbicide used in the United States and is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). Developmental  exposure to ATZ can lead to significant behavioral and morphological alterations  in exposed animals and their progeny suggesting the involvement of an epigenetic  mechanism. Specific epigenetic mechanisms responsible for these alterations,  however, are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to  0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb (μg/L) of ATZ from 1 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf).  Chemical exposure was ceased and zebrafish maintained until 9 months post  fertilization (mpf), when whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed  to assess the effects of embryonic ATZ exposure on DNA methylation in female fish  brains. The number of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) increased with  increasing treatment concentration. DMGs were enriched in neurological pathways  with extensive methylation changes consistently observed in neuroendocrine  pathways. Specifically, DMGs with methylation changes in promoter regions showed  hypomethylation in estrogen receptor signaling and hypermethylation in androgen  signaling. DMGs with methylation changes in genebody were primarily enriched for  mitochondrion-related pathways associated with healthy aging. Integrated analysis  with transcriptomic data at 9 mpf exhibited a similar trend identifying CABLES1  and NDUFA4 as shared targets at all concentrations. We then compared the  predicted upstream regulators of transcriptomic changes with DMGs and identified  CALML3 as a common upstream regulator at both 0.3 and 30 ppb that exhibit  significant methylation changes. Collectively, our study identified long-lasting  DNA methylation changes in genome after embryonic ATZ exposure and elucidated  potential gene targets whose aberrant methylation features may drive alterations  in gene transcription in long-term.},

The results  demonstrated that treatment with TDCPP (3 μM) from 0.75 h postfertilization (hpf)  inhibited cell rearrangement at 4 hpf, caused delay in epiboly at 5.7 and 8.5  hpf, and led to abnormal development (e.g., short tail, reduced body size) and  lethality between 14 and 45 hpf, which might be related with altered expression  of genes regulating embryogenesis. Furthermore, trunk curvature was observed as  the main phenotype in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae exposed to 1 or 3 μM TDCPP,  possibly by changing somite formation and expression of proteins related to fast  muscle and cartilage development. Collectively, our results suggest that exposure  to TDCPP causes developmental toxicity in vertebrates and warrant the need for  studies to evaluate the potential health risks of TDCPP to developing human  embryos/infants/children, due to its frequent presence in indoor dust and  potential for human exposure.},

However, little is  known regarding the molecular mechanism underlying its toxic effects on  vertebrate early development. To explore the impacts and underlying mechanisms of  PCP on early development, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to PCP at  concentrations of 0, 20 and 50 μg/L, and microscopic observation and cDNA  microarray analysis were subsequently conducted at gastrulation stage. The  morphological observations revealed that PCP caused a developmental delay of  zebrafish embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptomic data showed  that 50 μg/L PCP treatment resulted in significant changes in gene expression  level, and the genes involved in energy metabolism and cell behavior were  identified based on gene functional enrichment analysis. The energy production of  embryos was influenced by PCP via the activation of glycolysis along with the  inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The results suggested that PCP  acts as an inhibitor of OXPHOS at 8 hpf (hours postfertilization). Consistent  with the activated glycolysis, the cell cycle activity of PCP-treated embryos was  higher than the controls. These characteristics are similar to the Warburg  effect, which occurs in human tumors. The microinjection of exogenous ATP  confirmed that an additional energy supply could rescue PCP-treated embryos from  the developmental delay due to the energy deficit. Taken together, our results  demonstrated that PCP causes a Warburg-like effect on zebrafish embryos during  gastrulation, and the affected embryos had the phenotype of developmental delay.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subchronic  exposure to simazine on growth and the development of histopathological changes  in selected organs (gills, kidney, liver) in Danio rerio. METHODS: Juvenile  growth tests were performed on D. rerio according to the OECD method No. 215.  Fish at the age of 20 days were exposed to the environmental simazine  concentration commonly detected in Czech rivers (0.06 μg.L-1) and a range of  sublethal concentrations of simazine (0.6, 6.0 and 60.0 μg.L-1) for 28 days.  RESULTS: There were no significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) between the specific  growth rates (r) of the test groups and those of both control groups.  Histopathological examination revealed pathological changes in fish exposed to a  simazine concentration of 60.0 μg.L-1. The values of NOEC and LOEC of simazine  were 6.0 μg.L-1 and 60.0 μg.L-1.

Though the neurotoxicity  of cypermethrin has been thoroughly studied in adult rodents, little is so far  available regarding the developmental toxicity of cypermethrin to fish in early  life stages. To explore the potential developmental toxicity of cypermethrin, 4-h  post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations  of cypermethrin (0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg L⁻¹) until 96 h. Among a suite of  morphological abnormalities, the unique phenotype curvature was observed at  concentrations as low as 25 μg L⁻¹. Studies revealed that 400 μg L⁻¹ cypermethrin  significantly increased malondialdehyde production. In addition, activity of  antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase were  significantly induced in zebrafish larvae in a concentration-dependent manner. To  further investigate the toxic effects of cypermethrin on fish, acridine orange  (AO) staining was performed at 400 μg L⁻¹ cypermethrin and the result showed  notable signs of apoptosis mainly in the nervous system. Cypermethrin also  down-regulated ogg1 and increased p53 gene expression as well as the caspase-3  activity. Our results demonstrate that cypermethrin was able to induce oxidative  stress and produce apoptosis through the involvement of caspases in zebrafish  embryos. In this study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of  cypermethrin using zebrafish embryos, which could be helpful in fully  understanding the potential mechanisms of cypermethrin exposure during  embryogenesis and also suggested that zebrafish could serve as an ideal model for  studying developmental toxicity of environmental contaminants.},

Although several genetic risk factors have been identified in recent  years, little is known about the environmental factors that either cause  neurobehavioral disorders or contribute to their progression in genetically  predisposed individuals. One environmental factor that has raised concerns is  chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide that is widely used in agriculture and  is found ubiquitously in the environment. In the present study, we examined the  effects of sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure on anxiety-related behavior during  development using zebrafish larvae. We found that sub-chronic exposure to 0.01 or  0.1 μM chlorpyrifos during development induces specific behavioral defects in  7-day-old zebrafish larvae. The larvae displayed decreases in swim speed and  thigmotaxis, yet no changes in avoidance behavior were seen. Exposure to 0.001 μM  chlorpyrifos did not affect swimming, thigmotaxis, or avoidance behavior and  exposure to 1 μM chlorpyrifos induced behavioral defects, but also induced  defects in larval morphology. Since thigmotaxis, a preference for the edge, is an  anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae, we propose that sub-chronic  chlorpyrifos exposure interferes with the development of anxiety-related  behaviors. The results of this study provide a good starting point for  examination of the molecular, cellular, developmental, and neural mechanisms that  are affected by environmentally relevant concentrations of organophosphate  pesticides. A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms is important for  the development of predictive models and refined health policies to prevent  toxicant-induced neurobehavioral disorders.},

	abstract = {Organophosphate (OP) compounds include highly toxic chemicals widely used both as pesticides and as warfare nerve agents. Existing countermeasures are lifesaving,  but do not alleviate all long-term neurological sequelae, making OP poisoning a  public health concern worldwide and the search for fully efficient antidotes an  urgent need. OPs cause irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition,  inducing the so-called cholinergic syndrome characterized by peripheral  manifestations and seizures associated with permanent psychomotor deficits.  Besides immediate neurotoxicity, recent data have also identified  neuroinflammation and microglia activation as two processes that likely play an  important, albeit poorly understood, role in the physiopathology of OP  intoxication and its long-term consequences. To gain insight into the response of  microglia to OP poisoning, we used a previously described model of  diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) intoxication of zebrafish larvae. This model  reproduces almost all the defects seen in poisoned humans and preclinical models,  including AChE inhibition, neuronal epileptiform hyperexcitation, and increased  neuronal death. Here, we investigated in vivo the consequences of acute DFP  exposure on microglia morphology and behaviour, and on the expression of a set of  pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. We also used a genetic method of microglial  ablation to evaluate the role in the OP-induced neuropathology. We first showed  that DFP intoxication rapidly induced deep microglial phenotypic remodelling  resembling that seen in M1-type activated macrophages and characterized by an  amoeboid morphology, reduced branching, and increased mobility. DFP intoxication  also caused massive expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines Il1β,  Tnfα, Il8, and to a lesser extent, immuno-modulatory cytokine Il4, suggesting  complex microglial reprogramming that included neuroinflammatory activities.  Finally, microglia-depleted larvae were instrumental in showing that microglia  were major actors in DFP-induced neuroinflammation and, more importantly, that  OP-induced neuronal hyperactivation was markedly reduced in larvae fully devoid  of microglia. DFP poisoning rapidly triggered massive microglia-mediated  neuroinflammation, probably as a result of DFP-induced neuronal hyperexcitation,  which in turn further exacerbated neuronal activation. Microglia are thus a  relevant therapeutic target, and identifying substances reducing microglial  activation could add efficacy to existing OP antidote cocktails.},

By collecting and counting the number of sperm released  during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released  asynchronously. Sperms are released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest  surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water  for several minutes. Sperm trails consist of bands of viscous material in which  sperm are embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were  collected gradually within 180 min after 24 h, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of  exposure. It was established that the reductions in count, activity of sperm, and  average life span of sperm trails were significant (P{\textless}0.05) at the tested  concentrations, 5 and 50 microg/L after 1 month and 2 weeks of exposure to each  chemical tested and to their mixture, respectively. In conclusion, this study  demonstrates that DDT and A54 could react synergically and increase the  alteration in sperm release and activity as well as the life span of their  trails.},

The zebrafish were trained to stay in a dark compartment to avoid a weight  dropping into an acryl shuttle chamber with a central sliding door. The crossing  time was increased significantly, from 30.7+/-40.8s to 179.3+/-27.3s in the  training session and 179.9+/-28.0s in the test session carried out 2h later in  the controls. When treatment with 200 microM scopolamine was administered for 1h  prior to the training session, the crossing time did not increase. The  scopolamine-induced learning deficit was ameliorated by pretreatment with 20  microM physostigmine for 1h prior to scopolamine treatment; the crossing time was  similarly increased, as shown with the controls (60.9+/-11.5s, 130.9+/-27.5s, and  183.4+/-26.6s in the training session and 108.1+/-23.9s in the test session).  When scopolamine treatment was administered after the training session, the  crossing time in the test session was reduced significantly as compared to that  noted in the third trial of the training session, which was also ameliorated by  physostigmine pretreatment. These results show that scopolamine impairs both the  acquisition of passive avoidance response and retention of the learned response,  and that physostigmine rescues the amnesic effects of scopolamine in zebrafish.},

The burning of plastic pipes, wiring, construction materials, paint, and car  batteries released toxic chemicals into the environment, contaminating the air,  soil, and local waterways. Examples of toxins that were identified in the creeks  and waterways in and around Paradise included pentachlorophenol (PCP), chrysene,  and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of some of these chemicals on  embryonic development, hematopoiesis (blood formation), and the immune system  have not been thoroughly studied. Defining safe levels and the long-term effects  of exposure is imperative to understanding and mitigating potential negative  future outcomes. To perform these studies, we utilized zebrafish (Danio rerio), a  commonly used vertebrate model system to study development. We observed the  adverse effects of PCP on the development of zebrafish by using fluorescence  microscopy, and saw that increased concentrations of PCP decreased the numbers of  normal red blood cells and myeloid cells. Additionally, we observed that animal  survival decreased in response to increasing concentrations of PCP. Furthermore,  the prevalence of characteristic physical deformities such as tail curvature were  greater in the treatment groups. Lastly, runx1, cmyb, and cd41 expression was  reduced in fish treated with PCP. These results suggest that PCP has a previously  underappreciated effect on blood and immune cell development and future studies  should be performed to determine the molecular mechanisms involved.},

Identifying enantiomer  differences and developing high-efficiency green enantiopure pesticide is an  important strategy for reducing the negative effects of pesticides. In this  study, after confirming the absolute configuration of pydiflumetofen enantiomers,  fungicidal activity evaluation indicated that the activity of  S-(+)-pydiflumetofen was 81.3-421 times higher than R-(-)-pydiflumetofen on three  kinds of phytopathogens that control Fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), Alternaria  rot (Alternaria alternata) and Southern blight (Sclerotinia rolfsii), which might  be caused by the stronger binding ability of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen with the active  site of the target protein. The coexistence of R-(-)-pydiflumetofen would enhance  the toxicity of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen on zebrafish through synergistic effect.  Low-activity R-(-)-pydiflumetofen was preferentially dissipated in soybean,  soybean plants, cabbage and celery, which was opposite in soil. The persistence  of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen in crops and degradability in soil were advantageous for  pesticide effects and environmental protection. Based on the maximum residue  limit (MRL) and hazard quotient (HQ), the dietary risks were determined to be  acceptable for all crops. Thus, developing enantiopure S-(+)-pydiflumetofen  products might be a high-efficiency and low-risk strategy, and more studies  should be conducted in this aspect.},

This study systematically  evaluated the developmental toxicity of IMZ and IMZ-M on zebrafish (Danio rerio)  embryos and explored the potential mechanisms involved. The results showed that  IMZ and IMZ-M caused developmental toxicity, characterized by decreased heart  rate, hatching inhibition, and pericardial cyst in zebrafish embryos.  Subsequently, acridine orange (AO) staining revealed cell apoptosis in the area  around the heart regions of zebrafish larvae. Besides, the expression levels of  apoptosis-related genes also varied significantly. Furthermore, (1)H NMR-based  metabolomics analysis showed that IMZ and IMZ-M exposure could induce metabolic  profiles disorder in zebrafish larvae. Importantly, zebrafish exposure to IMZ and  IMZ-M significantly affected the metabolism of branched - chain amino acids,  energy, and ketone bodies, which are related to cell apoptosis. Overall, the  toxicity of IMZ and IMZ-M in zebrafish embryos and larvae was characterized,  suggesting a theoretical basis for the potential environmental risks of IMZ and  its metabolite IMZ-M on non-target organisms.},

	abstract = {Currently, neurotoxicity testing defined by OECD and FDA is based solely on in vivo experiments, using large numbers of animals, being expensive, time-consuming  and unsuitable for screening numerous chemicals. The great demand for thousands  of chemicals yet to be evaluated, urges the development of alternative test  methods which are cheaper, faster and highly predictive for developmental  neurotoxicity. In this study, we developed a new method to assess locomotor  activity in early life stage of zebrafish at 24 h post fertilization (hpf), in  comparison to locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 96 to 192 hpf. We  hypothesized that this endpoint at early life stages could be used to predict the  developmental neurotoxic potential of chemicals and performed exposure studies  with chlorpyrifos to demonstrate this. Furthermore, the case study with  chlorpyrifos was used to critically evaluate behavioral data analysis and improve  method sensitivity. The approach for data analysis using distribution plots for  parameters on locomotor activity, next to mean values allowed to obtain more  accurate information from the same set of behavioral data, both for embryos and  larvae. Embryos exposed to chlorpyrifos, within the range 0.039 to 10 mg/l,  exhibited a significant concentration-dependent increase in the frequency and  total duration of their spontaneous tail coilings at 24-26 hpf. Larvae exhibited  altered swimming activity, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the total  duration of movement and an increase in mean turn angle in the range 0.18 to 0.75  mg/l chlorpyrifos. Methodological evaluation showed that locomotor effects in  larvae were most pronounced and reproducible at 96 hpf, compared to older  individuals (120, 144, 168 and 192 hpf). These new methods based on locomotor  activity at early life stages of zebrafish allowed to classify chlorpyrifos as a  developmental neurotoxicant. Further research to judge the validity of these  alternative methods is currently performed with an extended set of expected  positive or negative chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Emamectin benzoate (EMB) is a widely used pesticide in agriculture, but its potential risks to the environment and health have not been fully evaluated. In  this study, we evaluated the toxicity of Emamectin benzoate using zebrafish  model, and found that it affected early embryonic development, such as  malformations and delayed hatching. Mechanistically, Emamectin benzoate increased  oxidative stress by excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and  abnormal activities of the antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, Emamectin benzoate  exposure caused abnormalities in zebrafish heart morphology and function, such as  long SV-BA distance and slow heart rate. Alterations were induced in the  transcription of heart development-related genes (nkx2.5, tbx5, gata4 and myl7).  In summary, our data showed that Emamectin benzoate induces developmental  toxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish. Our research provides new evidence on  the Emamectin benzoate's toxicity and potential risk in human health.},

Thus, new assays for ALP detection in live cells  are needed to better understand its role in related biological processes. In this  study, we constructed a novel near-infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe for  detecting ALP activity with high sensitivity. The probe uses a new  self-immolative mechanism that can achieve a rapid response (within 10 min) to  ALP, detected as a spectral shift (from 580 to 650 nm). This method effectively  avoids issues related to instrument variability, and the near-infrared  fluorescence emission (650 nm) makes it more suitable for biological detection.  Moreover, the high sensitivity (14-fold enhancement of the fluorescence ratio  F(650)/F(580)) and low detection limit (0.89 U L(-1)) for ALP allows the probe to  be adapted to complex biological environments. The assay was successfully  performed using serum samples with a linear range of ALP of up to 150 U L(-1). We  used the developed probe to detect and image endogenous ALP in cells with  satisfactory results, and we successfully used the probes to detect changes in  endogenous ALP levels in zebrafish caused by drug-induced organ damage.},

Zebrafish embryos (2 h post-fertilization) were exposed to TDCPP (0-100 μg/L) for  6 months up until sexual maturation. Concentrations of TDCPP and its metabolic  product (bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, BDCPP) were measured in the  tissues of 5 day post-fertilization (dpf) larvae. There was no effect on  locomotion, acetylcholinesterase activity, levels of the neurotransmitters  dopamine and serotonin, and expression of mRNAs and proteins related to central  nervous system development (e.g., myelin basic protein, α1-tubulin) in any  exposure group. However, in adult fish, reductions of dopamine and serotonin  levels were detected in the brains of females but not males. Downregulation of  nervous system development genes was observed in both the male and female brain  tissues. TDCPP concentrations were measured in adult fish tissues including the  brain, and greater levels were detected in females. Our results showed that  females are more sensitive to TDCPP stress than males in terms of TDCPP-induced  neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that long-term exposure to lower concentrations of  TDCPP in fish can lead to neurotoxicity.},

Within the present study, a new test method was applied which  evaluates behavioural changes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to quantify the  neurotoxic effect of selected chemicals. Changes in the frequency of spontaneous  tail movements - a parameter of locomotion - occurring during embryogenesis was  assessed as parameter for neurotoxic effects. Embryos were exposed in  24-microwell plates to neurotoxic compounds. Behaviour was examined after 24 h of  exposure by videotaping and quantifying spontaneous locomotion. Additionally,  acute toxicity was determined after 48 h of exposure by utilising the fish embryo  toxicity test. Abamectin, emamectin benzoate, chlorpyrifos-oxon and carbamazepine  were analysed using both: the new and classic acute test methods. The results  showed the neurotoxic effect of the substances. Furthermore, an increased  sensitivity compared to acute toxicity data was shown. The aim of the present  study, to illustrate the sensitivity and specificity of the established endpoint  to reliably assess adverse, neurotoxic effects of compounds on the model organism  Danio rerio and to apply a new test method was achieved.

The purpose of the  present work was to investigate if xenoestrogens are able to cause proliferation  of liver peroxisomes using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. Adult male  zebrafish were exposed for 15 days to 17beta-estradiol (E2) and the xenoestrogens  dibutylphthalate (DBP), methoxychlor (MXC), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and  17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2). All five tested compounds caused significant  proliferation of liver peroxisomes (p {\textless} 0.05) as indicated by increased  peroxisomal surface and numerical densities and elevated activities of the  peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX). In the case of DBP, MXC  and E2, positive significant correlations between peroxisomal density parameters  and AOX were found. The treatments did not produce gross alterations in testis  histology, but spermatogenic cell proliferation was disturbed in E2 and  EE2-treated groups and vitellogenin levels increased significantly in fish  exposed to MXC, OP, EE2 and E2 with respect to controls. Furthermore, a  significant correlation between vitellogenin levels and AOX activity was found  for MXC, OP and EE2 treatments, suggesting that for the latter xenoestrogens  early estrogenic effects are associated with liver peroxisome proliferation. No  such association occurred with typical peroxisome proliferators such as DBP.},

Methomyl affected embryo hatching and larva morphology and  behavior, especially in higher concentrations; resulting in smaller body and eyes  size, failure in swimming bladder inflation, hypolocomotor activity, and  concentration-dependent reduction of AChE activity; demonstrating methomyl strong  acute toxicity and neurotoxic effect.},

During zebrafish embryogenesis,  spontaneous tail contractions occur from late-segmentation (∼19 h  postfertilization, hpf) through early pharyngula (∼29 hpf) and represent the  first sign of locomotion. Using transgenic zebrafish (fli1:egfp) that stably  express eGFP beginning at ∼14 hpf, we have developed and optimized a  384-well-based HCS assay that quantifies spontaneous activity within single  zebrafish embryos after exposure to test chemicals in a concentration-response  format. Following static exposure of one embryo per well from 5 to 25 hpf,  automated image acquisition procedures and custom analysis protocols were used to  quantify total body area and spontaneous activity in live embryos. Survival and  imaging success rates across control plates ranged from 87.5 to 100\% and  93.3-100\%, respectively. Using our optimized procedures, we screened 16 chemicals  within the US EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library, and found that exposure to abamectin  and emamectin benzoate-both potent avermectins-abolished spontaneous activity in  the absence of gross malformations. Overall, compared to existing  locomotion-based zebrafish assays conducted later in development, this method  provides a simpler discovery platform for identifying potential developmental  neurotoxicants.},

	abstract = {Thyroid function may be altered by a very large number of chemicals routinely found in the environment Research evaluating potential thyroid disruption is  ongoing, but there are thousands of synthetic and naturally occurring drugs and  chemicals to be considered. European and United States policies call for the  development of simple methodologies for screening endocrine-disrupting chemicals.  Zebrafish are widely used as a model organism for assessing drug effects because  of their small size, high fecundity, rapid organogenesis, morphological and  physiological similarities to mammals, and easewithwhich large-scale phenotypic  screening is performed. A zebrafish-based short-duration screening method was  developed to detect the potential effect of chemicals and drugs on thyroid  function. This method used a T4 immunofluorescence quantitative disruption test  (TIQDT) to measure thyroid function. The 3 day exposure window protocol, from day  2 to day 5 postfertilization (dpf), avoided any potential side effects on thyroid  gland morphogenesis. Methimazole, propylthiouracil, and potassium perchlorate,  three well-known goitrogens, totally abolished T4 immunoreactivity in thyroid  follicles in a dose-specific manner. Amiodarone, a human pharmaceutical with a  reported cytotoxic effect on thyroid follicular cells, also decreased T4 levels.  Moreover, exposure to 50 nM 3,3',5-triiodothyronine induced a significant  decrease in T4 immunoreactivity as did DDT, 2,4-D, and 4-nonylphenol. In  conclusion, these data indicated that TIQDT may be useful for obtaining initial  information about the ability of environmental pollutants and drugs to impair  thyroid gland function as well as assessing the combined effects of endocrine  disruptors.},

It is understood that the combined toxicity may  differ from that of a single toxic substance.

In this paper, we designed a study to investigate the  single and combined effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) and the  triazole fungicide difenoconazole on zebrafish, and to explore the mechanism of  this effect. The results showed that PS-MPs could reduce the bioaccumulation of  difenoconazole in zebrafish to a certain extent and alleviate the oxidative  stress damage of difenoconazole in the zebrafish liver. The transcriptome and  qRT-PCR data revealed the association of multiple pathways in the difenoconazole  response, while the presence of PS-MPs ameliorated this effect in gene expression  changes. Due to the properties of PS-MPs and the interaction between them, the  toxic effect of difenoconazole when combined with PS-MPs is more prominent. These  results provide a novel aspect to understand the environmental behavior of MPs  and to evaluate the combined effect of MPs and pesticides on aquatic food.},

Its use on a  variety of crops leads to its potential entry into aquatic environments, but  little is known about its sub-lethal toxicity to early developmental stages of  aquatic vertebrates. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the toxicity of  pendimethalin to zebrafish embryos and larvae by measuring mortality,  developmental abnormalities, oxidative respiration, reactive oxygen species, gene  expression, and locomotor activity following exposure to the herbicide throughout  early development. Embryos at {\textasciitilde}6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to  either a solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one  dose of either 1, 2.5, 5, or 25 μM pendimethalin for up to 7-days post  fertilization depending on the bioassay. Exposure to 25 μM pendimethalin resulted  in high prevalence of spinal curvature, tail malformations, pericardial edema,  and yolk sac edema at 4 dpf, while exposure to 5 μM pendimethalin induced  pericardial edema and lordosis in the fish exposed over 7 dpf. Exposure to  pendimethalin up to 5 μM did not negatively impact oxidative respiration (e.g.,  basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production) in embryos following a 24-h  exposure. Pendimethalin did not induce reactive oxygen species at concentrations  of 1-5 μM. Levels of transcripts associated with oxidative respiration and damage  response were altered in 7d-larvae; cox1 mRNA was increased in larvae fish  exposed to 1 μM while cox5a1 and sod2 mRNA were decreased with 2.5 μM exposure.  The Visual Motor Response (VMR) test for light-dark response revealed that larval  activity in the dark period was reduced for zebrafish exposed to {\textgreater}1 μM  pendimethalin compared to ERM and DMSO solvent control groups. These data inform  on the sub-lethal toxicity of pendimethalin to early stages of fish embryos and  larvae.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The most toxic PCBs are the non-ortho-substituted ("dioxin-like") congeners that act  through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal  exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in  children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that  result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well  understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of  developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life  behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish  embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6,  1.2nM) for 20h (4-24h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in  clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days  post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using  the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several  times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation  were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity  in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126  resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in  adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation.  Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the  brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior,  suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage. Our results demonstrate the  effectiveness of the zebrafish model in detecting subtle and delayed behavioral  effects resulting from developmental exposure to an environmental contaminant.},

	abstract = {A 2019 retrospective study analyzed wristband personal samplers from fourteen different communities across three different continents for over 1530 organic  chemicals. Investigators identified fourteen chemicals (G14) detected in over 50\%  of personal samplers. The G14 represent a group of chemicals that individuals are  commonly exposed to, and are mainly associated with consumer products including  plasticizers, fragrances, flame retardants, and pesticides. The high frequency of  exposure to these chemicals raises questions of their potential adverse human  health effects. Additionally, the possibility of exposure to mixtures of these  chemicals is likely due to their co-occurrence; thus, the potential for mixtures  to induce differential bioactivity warrants further investigation. This study  describes a novel approach to broadly evaluate the hazards of personal chemical  exposures by coupling data from personal sampling devices with high-throughput  bioactivity screenings using in vitro and non-mammalian in vivo models. To  account for species and sensitivity differences, screening was conducted using  primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and early life-stage  zebrafish. Mixtures of the G14 and most potent G14 chemicals were created to  assess potential mixture effects. Chemical bioactivity was dependent on the model  system, with five and eleven chemicals deemed bioactive in NHBE and zebrafish,  respectively, supporting the use of a multi-system approach for bioactivity  testing and highlighting sensitivity differences between the models. In both NHBE  and zebrafish, mixture effects were observed when screening mixtures of the most  potent chemicals. Observations of BMC-based mixtures in NHBE (NHBE BMC Mix) and  zebrafish (ZF BMC Mix) suggested antagonistic effects. In this study, consumer  product-related chemicals were prioritized for bioactivity screening using  personal exposure data. High-throughput high-content screening was utilized to  assess the chemical bioactivity and mixture effects of the most potent chemicals.},

	abstract = {Dithiocarbamates form a large group of chemicals that have numerous uses in agriculture and medicine. It has been reported that dithiocarbamates, including  thiuram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), cause wavy distortions of the notochord  in zebrafish and other fish embryos. In the present study, we investigated the  mechanism underlying the toxicity of thiuram in zebrafish embryos. When embryos  were exposed to thiuram (2-1000 nM: 0.48-240 microg/L) from 3 h post  fertilization (hpf) (30\% epiboly) until 24 hpf (Prim-5), all embryos develop wavy  notochords, disorganized somites, and have shortened yolk sac extensions. The  thiuram response was specific and did not cause growth retardation or mortality  at 24 hpf. The thiuram-dependent responses showed the same concentration  dependence with a waterborne EC50 values of approximately 7 nM. Morphometric  measurements revealed that thiuram does not affect the rate of notochord  lengthening. However, the rate of overall body lengthening was significantly  reduced in thiuram-exposed animals. Other dithiocarbamates, such as ziram, caused  similar malformations to thiuram. While expression of genes involved in  somitogenesis was not affected, the levels of notochord-specific transcripts were  altered after the onset of malformations. Distortion of the notochord started  precisely at 18 hpf, which is concomitant with onset of spontaneous rhythmic  trunk contractions. Abolishment of spontaneous contractions using tricaine,  alpha-bungarotoxin, and a paralytic mutant sofa potato, resulted in normal  notochord morphology in the presence of thiuram. These results indicate that  muscle activity is necessary to reveal the underlying functional deficit and  suggest that the developmental target of dithiocarbamates impairs trunk  plasticity through an unknown mechanism.},

This study  examined the toxicity targets of CPF in early life stage of zebrafish on the  endpoints at developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and  immunotoxicity. Firstly, CPF exposure decreased the body length, inhibited the  hatchability and heart rate, and resulted in a number of morphological  abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and pericardial edema (PE), in  larval zebrafish. Secondly, the free swimming activities and the swimming  behaviors of the larvae in response to the stimulation of light-to-dark  photoperiod transition were significantly influenced by the exposure to 100 and  300 μg/L CPF. In addition, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the  transcription of some genes related to neurotoxicity were also influenced by CPF  exposure. Thirdly, CPF exposure induced oxidative stress in the larval zebrafish.  The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased and the glutathione (GSH) contents  decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner after the exposure to  CPF for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). CPF affected not only the activities  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and  glutathione S-transferase (GST), but also the transcriptional levels of their  respective genes. Finally, the mRNA levels of the main cytokines including tumor  necrosis factor α (Tnfα), interferon (Ifn), interleukin-1 beta (Il-1β),  interleukin 6 (Il6), complement factor 4 (C4) in the larvae increased  significantly after the exposure to 100 or 300 μg/L CPF for 96 hpf, suggesting  that the innate immune system disturbed by CPF in larvae. Taken together, our  results suggested that CPF had the potential to cause developmental toxicity,  behavior alterations, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in the larval  zebrafish.},

Previous research indicated involvement of  transport proteins in the TK of the anionic pesticide bromoxynil in zebrafish  embryos. We here explored the interaction of bromoxynil with the organic  anion-transporting polypeptide zebrafish Oatp1d1. Mass spectrometry imaging  revealed accumulation of bromoxynil in the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish  embryos, a tissue known to express Oatp1d1. In contrast to the Oatp1d1 reference  substrate bromosulfophthalein (BSP), which is actively taken up by transfected  HEK293 cells overexpressing zebrafish Oatp1d1, those cells accumulated less  bromoxynil than empty vector-transfected control cells. This indicates cellular  efflux of bromoxynil by Oatp1d1. This was also seen for diclofenac but not for  carbamazepine, examined for comparison. Correspondingly, internal concentrations  of bromoxynil and diclofenac in the zebrafish embryo were increased when  coexposed with BSP, inhibiting the activities of various transporter proteins,  including Oatp1d1. The effect of BSP on accumulation of bromoxynil and diclofenac  was enhanced in further advanced embryo stages, indicating increased efflux  activity in those stages. An action of Oatp1d1 as an efflux transporter of ionic  environmental compounds in zebrafish embryos should be considered in future TK  assessments.},

Adverse modifications in tail muscle tissue, the nervous system,  and energy metabolism were also observed in larvae. TP caused thinning of the  muscle bundle in the tail of larvae. In conjunction with the metabolomics  results, changes in dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) activity, and the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment,  indicate that TP may disrupt the nervous system in zebrafish larvae. The change  in metabolites (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate, cis-Aconitic acid, acetoacetyl-CoA,  coenzyme-A and 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA) involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  indicates that TP may disrupt energy metabolism.

	abstract = {Cartap is a widely used insecticide which belongs to a member of nereistoxin derivatives and acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor site. Its effects on  aquatic species are of grave concern. To explore the potential developmental  toxicity of cartap, zebrafish embryos were continually exposed, from 0.5 to 144h  post-fertilization, to a range of concentrations of 25-1000microg/l. Results of  the experiment indicated that cartap concentrations of 100microg/l and above  negatively affected embryo survival and hatching success. Morphological analysis  uncovered a large suite of abnormalities such as less melanin pigmentation, wavy  notochord, crooked trunk, fuzzy somites, neurogenesis defects and vasculature  defects. The most sensitive organ was proved to be the notochord which displayed  defects at concentrations as low as 25microg/l. Both sensitivity towards exposure  and localization of the defect were stage specific. To elucidate mechanisms  concerning notochord, pigmentation, and hatching defects, enzyme assay, RT Q-PCR,  and different exposure strategies were performed. For embryos with hatching  failure, chorion was verified not to be digested, while removing cartap from  exposure at early pre-hatching stage could significantly increase the hatching  success. However, cartap was proved, via vitro assay, to have no effect on  proteolytic activity of hatching enzyme. These findings implied that the  secretion of hatching enzyme might be blocked. We also revealed that cartap  inhibited the activity of melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase and matrix enzyme lysyl  oxidase and induced expression of their genes. These suggested that cartap could  impaired melanin pigmentation of zebrafish embryos through inhibiting tyrosinase  activity, while inhibition of lysyl oxidase activity was responsible for  notochord undulation, which subsequently caused somite defect, and at least  partially responsible for defects in vasculature and neurogenesis.},

Most toxicity studies are based on mammalian  test systems, which have been questioned for low sensitivity, limited relevance  for humans, and animal welfare considerations. This increased the need for  alternative models, one of which is the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo. This  study assessed selected neonicotinoids at sub-lethal concentrations for their  effects on embryonic development and behavior. The fish embryo acute toxicity  test (OECD TG 236) determined the lowest observable effective concentrations,  which were used as the highest test concentrations in subsequent behavioral  assays. In the FET test, no severe compound-induced sublethal effects were seen  at {\textless} 100 µM. In the coiling assay, exposure to ≥ 1.25 µM nicotine (positive  control) affected both the burst duration and burst count per minute, whereas ≥  50 µM thiacloprid affected the mean burst duration. Exposure to ≥ 50 µM  acetamiprid and imidacloprid induced significant alterations in both mean burst  duration and burst count per minute. In the swimming assay, 100 µM acetamiprid  induced alterations in the frequency and extent of movements, whilst nicotine  exposure only induced non-significant changes. All behavioral changes could be  correlated to findings in mammalian studies.

	abstract = {The U.S. EPA frequently uses avian or fish toxicity data to set protective standards for amphibians in ecological risk assessments. However, this approach  does not always adequately represent aquatic-dwelling and terrestrial-phase  amphibian exposure data. For instance, it is accepted that early life stage tests  for fish are typically sensitive enough to protect larval amphibians, however,  metamorphosis from tadpole to a terrestrial-phase adult relies on endocrine cues  that are less prevalent in fish but essential for amphibian life stage  transitions. These differences suggest that more robust approaches are needed to  adequately elucidate the impacts of pesticide exposure in amphibians across  critical life stages. Therefore, in the current study, methodology is presented  that can be applied to link the perturbations in the metabolomic response of  larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a surrogate species frequently used in  ecotoxicological studies, to those of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis)  tadpoles following exposure to three high-use pesticides, bifenthrin,  chlorothalonil, or trifluralin. Generally, D. rerio exhibited greater metabolic  perturbations in both number and magnitude across the pesticide exposures as  opposed to X. laevis. This suggests that screening ecological risk assessment  surrogate toxicity data would sufficiently protect amphibians at the single life  stage studied but care needs to be taken to understand the suite of metabolic  requirements of each developing species. Ultimately, methodology presented, and  data gathered herein will help inform the applicability of metabolomic profiling  in establishing the risk pesticide exposure poses to amphibians and potentially  other non-target species.},

	abstract = {The insecticide fipronil, one of the main pesticides used in Brazil, is often detected in natural aquatic environments, and causes neuronal hyperexcitation by  inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to putative alterations in  behaviour and development. This work sought to analyse the toxicity of formulated  Regent(®) 800WG (80\% fipronil) on development (fish embryo toxicity test, FET),  morphology, and swimming behaviour of larvae and adults of zebrafish (Danio  rerio). FET was performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging  from 0.002 to 1600 μg.L(-1) of formulated Regent(®) 800WG. Adults were exposed to  0.2, 2 and 20 μg.L(-1) of the product for 24 and 96 h, and were submitted to the  light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance tests No lethal parameters were  observed in larvae, but in concentrations above 400 µg.L(-1), there was  shortening of the body axis and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure  to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a  marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental  treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since  baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all  conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference  for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on  zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating  that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural  environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally  relevant concentrations of this pollutant.},

Mechanistic understanding is the key to successfully  translating zebrafish findings to humans. In the present study, we used a  well-known dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as a model chemical to  uncover the molecular pathways for observed DNT effects. To enhance the  specificity of potential molecular targets, we restricted our exposure to a  concentration that is nonteratogenic yet exhibits high DNT effects and an  exposure window sensitive to MPTP. Our DNT assessment based on a battery of motor  and social behavioral tests revealed an effective concentration of 1 μM and a  sensitive window of 48-96 h postfertilization (hpf) for MPTP-induced  hypoactivity. It is worth noting that this hypoactivity persisted into later  larval development until 28 dpf. We observed increased cell apoptosis, oxidative  stress, and decreased ATP levels in larvae immediately after exposure at 96 hpf.  Significant reductions of DA neurons were found in the retina at 72, 96, and 120  hpf. No visible deformity was found in motoneurons at 72, 96, and 120 hpf.  Transcriptome analysis uncovered a novel pathway manifested by significant  upregulation of genes enriched with erythropoiesis. Sensitive window exposure of  MPTP and other DA neurotoxins rotenone and paraquat exhibited a  concentration-dependent effect on transcriptional changes of embryonic  hemoglobins and anemia. Given that anemia is a significant risk factor for  Parkinson's disease and MPTP is known to cause parkinsonism in humans, we  concluded that anemia resulting from dysregulation of primitive erythropoiesis  during embryonic development might serve as a common mechanism underlying DA  neurotoxin-induced DNT effects between zebrafish and humans.},

In this study, a  pyrimidine derivative, benzyl  7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate  (BHDPC), was found to attenuate dramatically the MPTP-induced death of  dopaminergic neurons and improve behavior movement deficiency in zebrafish,  supporting its potential neuroprotective activity in vivo. Further study in rat  organotypic cerebellar cultures indicated that BHDPC was able to suppress  MPP(+)-induced cell death of brain tissue slices ex vivo. The protective effect  of BHDPC against MPP(+) toxicity was also effective in human neuroblastoma  SH-SY5Y cells through restoring abnormal changes in mitochondrial membrane  potential and numerous apoptotic regulators. Western blotting analysis indicated  that BHDPC was able to activate PKA/CREB survival signaling and further  up-regulate Bcl2 expression. However, BHDPC failed to suppress MPP(+)-induced  cytotoxicity and the increase of caspase 3 activity in the presence of the PKA  inhibitor H89. Taken together, these results suggest that BHDPC is a potential  neuroprotectant with prosurvival effects in multiple models of neurodegenerative  disease in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.},

It is used for genetically modified crops, and particularly in Florida, it is  used as a sugar cane ripener. An aquatic formulation (Rodeo®) is used to treat  aquatic weeds in waterbodies and drainage canals. Because of its extended use,  glyphosate can run off or be sprayed directly into waterbodies, and chronically  expose aquatic wildlife. Exposure in animal models has been associated with  kidney and liver damage and glyphosate has been suggested as an endocrine  disruptor. We exposed adult male largemouth bass for 21 days to two doses of  glyphosate and Rodeo® (chemically equivalent concentration of glyphosate) at 0.5  mg L(-1) and 10 mg L(-1) and to a clean water control (n=4 fish/tank in  quadruplicate). Concentrations during the experiment were corroborated with  UHPLC-MS/MS. Total RNA was isolated from the trunk kidney and head kidney.  RNA-seq was performed for the high doses compared to controls. Transcripts were  analyzed with fish and mammalian pathway analyses software. Transcripts mapped to  Zebrafish metabolic pathways using PaintOmics showed steroid hormone biosynthesis  in the trunk kidney as the most significantly enriched pathway. Steroid hormones  were measured in plasma by UHPLC-MS/MS. Total androgens were significantly  reduced at 0.5 mg L(-1) of glyphosate and at equivalent concentrations in Rodeo®  compared to controls. 11-ketotestosterone and estrone concentrations were  significantly reduced in all doses. A gene involved in the conversion of  testosterone to 11-ketotestosterone was down-regulated by glyphosate. Using the  mammalian pathway analysis algorithm, cellular processes associated with T-cell  activation/development and intracellular pH were significantly enriched in the  trunk kidney by glyphosate and Rodeo® exposure. Endocrine disruption was  corroborated at the hormone and gene expression levels. Rodeo® and glyphosate  share gene expression pathways, however, Rodeo® had more pronounced effects in  largemouth bass.},

With transcriptomic analysis, we found that exposure to high  dose PCZ could produce 76 downregulated and 345 upregulated differential  expression genes (DEGs). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of the DEGs  were characterized in the pathways of glycolipid metabolism, amino acid  metabolism and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. Targeted metabolomic  analysis was conducted to verify the effects of PCZ on the levels of  acyl-carnitines and some amino acids in larval zebrafish. In addition,  biochemical indicators related to glycolipid metabolism were affected obviously,  manifested as elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and decreased glucose (Glu)  levels in whole larvae. The expression levels of genes associated with glycolipid  metabolism were affected in larvae after exposure to PCZ (PK, GK, PEPckc, SREBP,  ACO). Interestingly, we further confirmed that PCZ could induce oxidative stress  by the changing enzyme activities (T-GSH, GSSG) and upregulating several related  genes levels in larval zebrafish.

There is a lack of toxicity data  for some triazoles such as fenbuconazole in aquatic organisms. This research was  conducted to evaluate the toxicity of fenbuconazole at environmentally relevant  concentrations with attention on the mitochondria, antioxidant system, and  locomotor activity in zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to one concentration of  5, 50, 200 or 500 ng/L fenbuconazole for 96 h. There was no effect on survival  nor percentage of fish hatched, but exposure to 200 and 500 ng/L fenbuconazole  resulted in malformation and hypoactivity in zebrafish. Oxygen consumption rates  (OCR) of embryos were measured to determine if the fungicide impaired  mitochondrial respiration. Exposure to 500 ng/L fenbuconazole reduced basal OCR  and oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration in exposed fish. Fenbuconazole  reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the activities of  mitochondrial Complex II and III. Transcript levels of both sdhc and cyc1, each  related to Complex II and III, were also altered in expression by fenbuconazole  exposure, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in embryos. Fenbuconazole  activated the antioxidant system, based upon both transcriptional and enzymatic  data in zebrafish. Consistent with mitochondrial impairment, molecular docking  confirmed a strong binding capacity of the fungicide at the Q(i) site of Complex  III, revealing this complex is susceptible to fenbuconazole.

	abstract = {Using paraoxon as a reference acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, the objective of this study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that  provided quantitative linkages across levels of biological organization during  zebrafish embryogenesis. Within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated  that ache transcripts and AChE activity increased in a stage-dependent manner  following segmentation. We then showed that static exposure of embryos to  paraoxon (31.2-500 nM) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and  concentration-dependent AChE inhibition, albeit these effects were fully  reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the  presence of significant AChE inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon  concentrations (≤250 nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron  development at 96 hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of  paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor  behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron  axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of  spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal AChE  expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon  concentrations as low as 31.2 nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal AChE  activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous  tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that  may be independent of AChE inhibition. Using a well-studied reference chemical,  this study highlights the potential challenges in developing quantitative AOPs to  support chemical screening and prioritization strategies.},

Based on their  mode of action in plants (potent inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis), we focused  attention on mechanisms related to cellular, lipid, and steroid metabolism.  Evidence from several studies reveals that zebrafish exposed to triazoles present  with impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress, as  well as dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Such metabolic disruptions are  expected to underscore developmental delays, deformity, and aberrant locomotor  activity and behaviors often observed following exposure. We begin by summarizing  physiological and behavioral effects observed with triazole fungicide exposure in  zebrafish. We then discuss mechanisms that may underlie adverse apical effects,  focusing on mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism. Using computational  approaches, we also identify novel biomarkers of triazole fungicide exposure.  Extracting and analyzing data contained in the Comparative Toxicogenomics  Database (CTD) revealed that transcriptional signatures responsive to different  triazoles are related to metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, biological  oxidations, and fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism among  other processes. Pathway and sub-network analysis identified several transcripts  that are responsive in organisms exposed to triazole fungicides, several of which  include lipid-related genes. Knowledge gaps and recommendations for future  investigations include; (1) targeted metabolomics for metabolites in glycolysis,  Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain; (2) additional studies conducted  at environmentally relevant concentrations to characterize the potential for  endocrine disruption, given that studies point to altered cholesterol (precursor  for steroid hormones), as well as altered estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid  hormone expression; (3) studies into the potential role for lipid peroxidation  and oxidation of lipid biomolecules as a mechanism of triazole-induced toxicity,  given the strong evidence for oxidative damage in zebrafish following exposure to  triazole fungicides.},

The study found that the three  surfactants had no significant effect on the degradation of metolachlor in the  system at environmental concentrations. However, at critical micelle  concentration, cationic surfactant octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and  nonionic surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ether promoted the degradation of  metolachlor in water-sediment system. Anionic surfactant odium dodecylbenzene  sulfonate (SDBS) prolonged the degradation half-life of metolachlor. The presence  of surfactants not only affected the environmental behavior of pesticides. When  they coexisted with pesticides, the joint toxicity to aquatic organisms cannot be  ignored. This study found that the combined effects of three surfactants and  metolachlor on the acute developmental toxicity of zebrafish embryos were all  synergistic effects. The combined effects of two ionic surfactants and  metolachlor on the acute toxicity of adult zebrafish were synergistic effects.  Further study showed that co-exposure of SDBS and metolachlor increased the  absorption of metolachlor by zebrafish. Combined exposure of SDBS and metolachlor  caused oxidative stress in brain, gill and liver of zebrafish. The results showed  that the simultaneous presence of anionic surfactants and pesticides in the  environment may increase the environmental risk of pesticides.},

Herein, we report the generation of  biologically inert precursors of cytotoxic gemcitabine by introducing  Pd(0)-cleavable groups in positions that are mechanistically relevant for  gemcitabine's pharmacological activity. Cell viability studies in pancreatic  cancer cells showed that carbamate functionalization of the 4-amino group of  gemcitabine significantly reduced ({\textgreater}23-fold) the prodrugs' cytotoxicity. The  N-propargyloxycarbonyl (N-Poc) promoiety displayed the highest sensitivity to  heterogeneous palladium catalysis under biocompatible conditions, with a reaction  half-life of less than 6 h. Zebrafish studies with allyl, propargyl, and benzyl  carbamate-protected rhodamines confirmed N-Poc as the most suitable masking group  for implementing in vivo bioorthogonal organometallic chemistry.},

However, obvious developmental toxicity manifested as inhibition of surviving  rate, heart rate and body length as well as increased malformation was observed  in the higher concentrations of TPhP (72 and 144 μg·L(-1)) alone and the  co-exposure groups. Additionally, results suggested that nano-TiO(2)  significantly enhanced the bioaccumulation of TPhP in zebtafish larvae, and thus  aggravated the abnormities of spontaneous movement and swimming behavior in  zebrafish larvae induced by TPhP. Nano-TiO(2) also exacerbated the TPhP-induced  inhibition of the axonal growth on the secondary motor neuron, and aggravated the  TPhP-induced decrease on expressions of neuron-specific green fluorescent protein  (GFP) and neuronal marker genes (ngn1 and elavl3). Further, the content of  neurotransmitter serotonin was not altered by TPhP alone exposure, but was  decreased significantly in the co-exposure group of 144 μg·L(-1) TPhP and  nano-TiO(2). Our data indicated that nano-TiO(2) might aggravate the neuron  abnormities and serotonin system dysfunction by enhancing the TPhP accumulation,  leading to exacerbated abnormal locomotors in zebrafish larvae.},

In this study, the structural alterations in one diencephalic  dopaminergic nucleus induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a toxin  inducing Parkinson's disease in humans, and those found in several neuronal  groups after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the pretoxin,  were associated with decreased swimming speed. Detailed cell counts of  dopaminergic groups indicated a transient decline of tyrosine hydroxylase  expressing neurons up to about 50\% after MPTP. The MPTP effect was partly  sensitive to monoamine oxidase inhibitor deprenyl. Detailed analysis of the  developing catecholaminergic cell groups suggests that the cell groups emerged at  their final positions and no obvious significant migration from the original  positions was seen. One 5-HT neuron group was also affected by MPTP treatment,  whereas other groups remained intact, suggesting that the effect is selective.  New nomenclature for developing catecholaminergic cell groups corresponding to  adult groups is introduced. The diencephalic cell population consisting of groups  5,6 and 11 was sensitive to both MPTP and MPP+ and in this respect resembles  mammalian substantia nigra.

Fish length was not affected by treatment at  any time during the exposure period. The bioconcentration factor for RDX seemed  to be influenced by time of exposure but not by water RDX concentration; its  overall values were 1.01+/-0.13, 0.91+/-0.06 and 2.23+/-0.04 at 4, 8 weeks and 12  weeks, respectively.

Reproductive performance was evaluated by biweekly breeding of  the fish and measuring packed-egg volume (PEV) as index of fecundity. At 0.5 ppm,  RDX caused elevated PEV levels relative to the control value at 2 weeks but not  at 4 or 6 weeks, whereas no significant effects were noted at 3.2 ppm.

	abstract = {For specific primary modes of action (MoA) in environmental non-target organisms, EU legislation restricts the usage of active substances of pesticides or  biocides. Corresponding regulatory hazard assessments are costly, time consuming  and require large numbers of non-human animal studies. Currently, predictive  toxicology of development compounds relies on their chemical structure and  provides little insights into toxicity mechanisms that precede adverse effects.  Using the zebrafish embryo model, we characterized transcriptomic responses to a  range of sublethal concentrations of six nerve- and muscle-targeting insecticides  with different MoA (abamectin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, imidacloprid \&  methoxychlor). Our aim was to identify affected biological processes and suitable  biomarker candidates for MoA-specific signatures. Abamectin showed the most  divergent signature among the tested insecticides, linked to lipid metabolic  processes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after imidacloprid exposure were  primarily associated with immune system and inflammation. In total, 222 early  responsive genes to either MoA were identified, many related to three major  processes: (1) cardiac muscle cell development and functioning (tcap, desma,  bag3, hspb1, hspb8, flnca, myoz3a, mybpc2b, actc2, tnnt2c), (2) oxygen transport  and hypoxic stress (alas2, hbbe1.1, hbbe1.3, hbbe2, hbae3, igfbp1a, hif1al) and  (3) neuronal development and plasticity (npas4a, egr1, btg2, ier2a, vgf). The  thyroidal function related gene dio3b was upregulated by chlorpyrifos and  downregulated by higher abamectin concentrations. Important regulatory genes for  cardiac muscle (tcap) and forebrain development (npas4a) were the most frequently  ifferentially expressed across all insecticide treatments. We consider the  identified gene sets as useful early warning biomarker candidates, i.e. for  developmental toxicity targeting heart and brain in aquatic vertebrates. Our  findings provide a better understanding about early molecular events in response  to the analyzed MoA. Perceptively, this promotes the development for sensitive  and informative biomarker-based in vitro assays for toxicological MoA prediction  and AOP refinement, without the suffering of adult fish.},

While designed to specifically target  invertebrate nAChRs, recent studies have reported adverse effects of  neonicotinoid exposure in early life-stage fish. This study examined the health  and neurobehavioral impacts of chronic exposure to various concentrations of TM  or nicotine (NIC) in early life zebrafish (Danio rerio) in conjunction with  in-silico molecular docking to compare their ligand-receptor interactions with  vertebrate nAChR. Chronic exposure to both reduced survival by approximately 20\%  (163 µg TM/l) and 25-100\% (≥0.49 µg NIC/l). Hatching and growth were impaired  following exposure to ≥0.21 µg TM/l or 4.9 µg NIC/l. Both TM and NIC produced  morphological and behavioral indicators of neurotoxicity, with more potent  effects following NIC exposure. NIC impaired embryonic motor activity by 40\%  (49 µg NIC/l), while both TM and NIC significantly altered predator escape  response in larvae, specifically the latency and the initial burst movement of  the response were impacted. Molecular docking predicted variations in the type  and strength of interactions that occur between NIC or TM and vertebrate nAChR.  These findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to TM might impact general  health and neurobehavior of early-stage zebrafish. Our data support hypotheses  that TM presents low affinity for vertebrate nAChR but may still pose an adverse  risk to larval fish growth and neurobehavior.},

Here we show that synthetic polyurethane nanoparticles  (PU NPs, diameter 34-64 nm) with rich surface COO(-) functional groups (zeta  potential -70 to -50 mV) can suppress the immune response of macrophages. The  specially-designed PU NPs reduce the gene expression levels of proinflammatory  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) for endotoxin-treated macrophages. The PU NPs  increase the intracellular calcium of macrophages (4.5-6.5 fold) and activate  autophagy. This is in contrast to the autophagy dysfunction generally observed  upon NP exposure. These PU NPs may further decrease the nuclear factor-κB-related  inflammation via autophagy pathways. The immunosuppressive activities of PU NPs  can prevent animal death by inhibiting the macrophage recruitment and  proinflammatory responses, confirmed by an in vivo zebrafish model. Therefore,  the novel biodegradable PU NPs demonstrate COO(-) dependent immunosuppressive  properties without carrying any anti-inflammatory agents. This study suggests  that NP surface chemistry may regulate the immune response, which provides a new  paradigm for potential applications of NPs in anti-inflammation and  immunomodulation.},

The abundance  of the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has been declining  since the 1980s probably due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic  factors. In this paper, we explore the transcriptomic dynamics between  individuals from high (river Tiber, Italy) and low pollution (lake Bolsena,  Italy) environments, which were measured for 36 PCBs, several organochlorine  pesticides and brominated flame retardants and nine metals. RESULTS: To this end,  we first (i) updated the European eel transcriptome using deep sequencing data  with a total of 640,040 reads assembled into 44,896 contigs (Eeelbase release  2.0), and (ii) developed a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression  profiling in the critically endangered European eel of about 15,000 annotated  contigs, which was applied to detect differentially expressed genes between  polluted sites. Several detoxification genes related to metabolism of pollutants  were upregulated in the highly polluted site, including genes that take part in  phase I of the xenobiotic metabolism (CYP3A), phase II  (glutathione-S-transferase) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase). In  addition, key genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative  phosphorylation were down-regulated at the Tiber site relative to the Bolsena  site. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the induced high expression of detoxification  genes, the suggested lowered expression of genes supposedly involved in  metabolism suggests that pollution may also be associated with decreased  respiratory and energy production.},

The effects of lindane  were investigated by recording behavior and survival of the F0- and F1-generation  as well as morphological alterations in liver ultrastructure of F0. Changes in  peroxisomes were visualized by cytochemical staining for catalase activity with  diaminobenzidine. Whereas behavioral changes can already be observed at 40  micrograms/liter, survival and number of eggs in F0 as well as survival and  growth of F1 are unaffected by up to 80 micrograms/liter lindane. At  concentrations greater than or equal to 110 micrograms/liter, survival of larvae  is reduced already after 35 days, and mortality is 100\% after 3 months. From 40  micrograms/liter, liver ultrastructure displays a microvesicular fatty  vacuolation (steatosis) characterized by lipid deposition within the cisternae of  the RER. At 40 micrograms/liter, this highly specific pathological change is  accompanied by accumulation of hepatic macrovesicular triglyceride droplets,  glycogen depletion, and the occurrence of club-shaped mitochondria. Additional  alterations at 80 micrograms/liter comprise proliferation of SER in males and  progressive fractionation of RER in females, stacking of club-shaped  mitochondria, a conspicuous decrease in peroxisomal catalase activity,  infiltration of macrophages into the liver parenchyma, and a significant  stimulation of hepatocytic mitosis. Among several substances tested so far in  zebra fish (4-nitrophenol, 4-chloroaniline 3,4-dichloroaniline, atrazine,  lindane), lindane is the only compound inducing behavioral changes and hepatic  steatosis in conjunction with a reduction in fertility. With regard to the  relative sensitivity of the methods applied, behavioral and cytological studies  appear more responsive to lindane exposure than survival studies.},

	abstract = {Once in the aquatic ecosystems, nanoplastics (NPls) can interact with other contaminants acting as vectors of transport and altering their toxicological  effects towards organisms. Thus, the present study aims to investigate how  polystyrene NPls (44 nm) interact with the herbicide phenmedipham (PHE) and  affect its toxicity to zebrafish embryos. Single exposures to 0, 0.015, 0.15,  1.5, 15 and 150 mg/L NPls and 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg/L PHE were performed.  Embryos were also exposed to the binominal combinations: 0.015 mg/L NPls + 2 mg/L  PHE, 0.015 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE, 1.5 mg/L NPls + 2 mg/L PHE and 1.5 mg/L NPls  + 20 mg/L PHE. Due to the low solubility of PHE in water, a solvent control was  performed (0.01\% acetone). PHE was quantified. Mortality, heartbeat and hatching  rate, malformations appearance, locomotor behavior and biomarkers related to  oxidative stress, neurotransmission and energy budgets were analyzed. During  96 h, NPls and PHE single and combined exposures did not affect embryos  development. After 120 h, NPls induced hyperactivity and PHE induced  hypoactivity. After 96 h, NPls increased catalase activity and PHE increased  glutathione S-transferases activity. On the combination 0.015 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L  PHE, hyperactivity behavior was found, similar to 0.015 mg/L NPls, and  cholinesterase activity was inhibited. Additionally, the combination 1.5 mg/L  NPls + 20 mg/L PHE increased both catalase and glutathione S-transferases  activities. The combination NPls with PHE affected more biochemical endpoints  than the single exposures, showing the higher effect of the binominal  combinations. Dissimilar interactions effects - no interaction, synergism and  antagonism - between NPls and PHE were found. The current study shows that the  effects of NPls on bioavailability and toxicity of other contaminants (e.g. PHE)  cannot be ignored during the assessment of NPls environmental behavior and risks.},

Therefore, we exposed adult female  zebrafish to environmentally relevant levels of deltamethrin (30, 100, and 333  ng/L) for 21 days to assess neurobehavioral changes related to the central  nervous system and explore the modes of action. Behavioral assays revealed  significant increases in the swimming speeds, residence time near other fish and  the shoaling cohesion in exposed fish. Transcriptomic results enriched the  disrupted neural functions involving the glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses  in the brain. The qRT-PCR confirmed the upregulation of the factors for promoting  the glutamate release. The measurement of neurotransmitters showed significantly  increased content of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain.  Taken together, deltamethrin exposure increased the glutamate level and promoted  the release of such an excitatory neurotransmitter between the glutamatergic  synapses in the brain, which eventually led to hyperactivity of social behaviors  in adult zebrafish.},

However, recent studies reported that they could have an accumulation  effect in human which may cause series of health problems. Estrogen receptors  (ER) are a class of nuclear receptors that are vital in proper physiological  behavior of estrogens. To investigate the reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids,  homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were  conducted to explore the interaction between pyrethroids and ERα from atomic  scale. The human ERα (2YJA) was selected as a template protein for homology  modeling. Then eight typical pyrethroids and positive control estradiol were  docked to the modeled protein. The highest scoring bifenthrin and the lowest  scoring permethrin were chosen for in-depth analysis. MDs showed that the complex  formed by permethrin with ERα had a lower RMSD value and binding free energies  compared to bifenthrin. Based on these results from microscopic dimension,  exposure experiments were implemented to validate the primary conclusions. VTG  concentrations in male zebrafish's blood were significantly higher under  permethrin exposure than bifenthrin, suggesting a stronger estrogenic activity  and binding propensity. In this regard, the structural characteristics of  molecules were analyzed, expecting to provide theoretical references for  subsequent drug design and rational drug application.},

Some of the  characteristics that prove of value are described and illustrated. Fluorescent  transgenic lines of zebrafish embryos are presented for time-line studies with  neurotoxicants. While genetic knockout technology has yet to be developed for the  model, the anti-sense, morpholino approach allows for knockdown of expression of  genes for the 3 day, embryonic period. This can provide for phenocopies of mutant  genes for those genes essential to embryonic development or it can provide for a  limited inhibition of gene expression that allows subsequent development of the  fish. With the zebrafish genomic sequencing effort, microarray technology is now  developing for the model system. These resources and technologies allow one to  challenge the system with toxicants, and to view the immediate effects of the  toxicants with transgenic embryos that fluoresce in part or all of the nervous  system. Behavioral and learning protocols have been developed for the organism so  that early exposures can be assayed for effects upon adult fish. Microarray  technology should allow for one to identify specific genes and pathways affected  by a neurotoxicant. In the future, these approaches should provide a working  protocol for exploring molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicants. This type of  complementary approach should then allow for more efficient examination and  testing of mechanisms in mammalian models.},

The fertilized zebrafish embryos were exposed to PCBs at concentrations  of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1mg/L until 7 days post-fertilization.

The OMR test showed that the visual behavior  of the larvae was most sensitive when the grating spatial frequency was 0.20LP/mm  and the moving speed was 25cm/s. Moreover, the proportion of positively swimming  fish was significantly reduced in the 0.5 and 1mg/L PCB1254 treatment group  (P{\textless}0.05) compared with the controls. In addition, the expression of SWS2 was  significantly down-regulated in all PCB1254 treatment groups (P{\textless}0.05), whereas  the decreased expression of the CRX, RHO and SWS1 was found in the 0.5 and 1mg/L  PCB1254 groups (P{\textless}0.05). This is the first report to demonstrate that continue  exposure of zebrafish larvae to PCBs causes photoreceptor cell  development-related gene expression changes that lead to OMR behavioral  alterations. Analysis of these visual behavioral paradigms may be useful in  predicting the adverse effects of toxicants on visual function in fish.},

Within zebrafish,  initiation of TDCIPP exposure at 0.75 h post-fertilization (hpf) reliably  disrupts cytosine methylation from cleavage (2 hpf) through early-gastrulation (6  hpf). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether  TDCIPP-induced effects on cytosine methylation persist beyond 6 hpf. First, we  exposed embryos to vehicle or TDCIPP from 0.75 hpf to 6, 24, or 48 hpf, and then  conducted bisulfite amplicon sequencing of a target locus (lmo7b) using genomic  DNA derived from whole embryos. Within both vehicle- and TDCIPP-treated embryos,  CpG methylation was similar at 6 hpf and CHG/CHH methylation were similar at 24  and 48 hpf (relative to 6 hpf). However, relative to 6 hpf within the same  treatment, CpG methylation was lower within vehicle-treated embryos at 48 hpf and  TDCIPP-treated embryos at 24 and 48 hpf - an effect that was driven by  acceleration of CpG hypomethylation. Similar to our previous findings with DNA  methyltransferase, we found that, even at high μM concentrations, TDCIPP had no  effect on zebrafish and human thymine DNA glycosylase activity (a key enzyme that  decreases CpG methylation), suggesting that TDCIPP-induced effects on CpG  methylation are not driven by direct interaction with thymine DNA glycosylase.  Finally, using 5-methylcytosine (5-mC)-specific whole-mount immunochemistry and  automated imaging, we found that exposure to TDCIPP increased 5-mC abundance  within the yolk of blastula-stage embryos, suggesting that TDCIPP may impact  cytosine methylation of maternally loaded mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic  transition. Overall, our findings suggest that TDCIPP disrupts the trajectory of  cytosine methylation during zebrafish embryogenesis, effects which do not appear  to be driven by direct interaction of TDCIPP with key enzymes that regulate  cytosine methylation.},

The assessment results showed  that the release and sedimentation behavior of LC-MCs in water and toxicity to  zebrafish at three life stages were all particle size-dependent. As the diameter  distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale ({\textasciitilde}27 µm), the  capsules released more slowly and sunk more quickly in water. In addition,  micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in significantly less fish mortality and  malformations of larvae and embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The  highest accumulation of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae  suggested that the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would  pose unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms. The obvious  toxicological differences of LC-MCs toward aquatic organisms implies that  regulating MC production in an appropriate size range is an important  prerequisite for achieving efficient but safe pesticide applications.},

Exposure to GBH  decreased survival, caused hypermobility and anxiolytic behavior, negatively  affected the anti-predatory behavior of the larvae, and increases  acetylcholinesterase activity, whereas exposure to DBH caused only slight  hypermobility in the larvae and increases acetylcholinesterase activity. These  changes may compromise the perpetuation of the species, the search for  partners/food, and facilitate the action of predators, which can result in  serious ecological consequences.},

Our results confirm  a very strong correlation of zebrafish embryo to fish acute toxicity. When  toxicity values were calculated based on measured exposure concentrations, the  slope of the type II regression line was 1 and nearly passed through the origin  (1 to 1 correlation). Measured concentrations also explained several apparent  outliers. Neither prolonged exposure (up to 120 h) nor consideration of sublethal  effects led to a reduced number of outliers.

We chose equi-fugacity and above-fugacity concentrations  of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as background contamination and plastic  additive concentrations, respectively, to investigate the effects of MPs on PCB  bioaccumulation; we compared the effects of MPs with those of food-borne  particles (FBPs). Co-exposure to MPs and FBPs at both the equi-fugacity and  above-fugacity PCB concentrations had no obvious toxic effects (ROS generation  and cyp1a expression) on zebrafish. When the zebrafish were exposed to the  equi-fugacity PCB concentrations, the PCB concentrations reached 177.7-400.5 ng/g  after a 7-d uptake; the presence of MPs did not significantly enhance PCB  bioaccumulation. The remaining PCB concentrations in the fish after a 4-d  depuration were 58.4-125.1 ng/g; the effects of MPs were the same as those during  the uptake period. However, at the above-fugacity PCB concentrations, the MPs  markedly increased the PCB bioaccumulation (by 1.8-fold) to 712.9 ng/g. This is  because at above-fugacity concentrations, PCBs on MPs migrate to organisms as  there were high fugacity gradients. The FBPs enhanced PCB bioaccumulation in  zebrafish more effectively than the MPs, even after depuration. In the presence  of FBPs, PCB bioaccumulation increased by 2.8- and 4.2- fold after uptake in the  equi-fugacity and above-fugacity scenarios, respectively, both of which were  significantly higher than that observed for the MPs. This is probably because  FBPs are easily assimilated by fish, making the associated PCBs more  bioavailable. Finally, during the co-existence of MPs and FBPs, MPs facilitate  the depuration of PCBs accumulated via FBP vectors; conversely, FBPs did not  affect PCB accumulation via MP vectors. Thus, this study elucidated the effects  of MPs and FBPs on the bioaccumulation of pollutants at equi-fugacity or  above-fugacity concentrations in aquatic environments.},

The stiffness of the hydrogel could  be easily fine-tuned by the solid content of the dispersion. Neural stem cells  (NSCs) were embedded into the polyurethane dispersions before gelation. The  dispersions containing NSCs were subsequently printed and maintained at 37 °C.  The NSCs in 25-30\% PU2 hydrogels (∼680-2400 Pa) had excellent proliferation and  differentiation but not in 25-30\% PU1 hydrogels. Moreover, NSC-laden 25-30\% PU2  hydrogels injected into the zebrafish embryo neural injury model could rescue the  function of impaired nervous system. However, NSC-laden 25-30\% PU1 hydrogels only  showed a minor repair effect in the zebrafish model.

The objective of this study was to identify the potential role  of epidermal ionocytes in mediating TPHP-induced pericardial edema within  zebrafish embryos. Exposure to TPHP from 24 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf)  resulted in a significant increase in pericardial edema and the number of  ionocytes at 72 hpf relative to time-matched embryos treated with vehicle. In  addition, co-exposure of embryos to mannitol (an osmotic diuretic) blocked  TPHP-induced pericardial edema and effects on ionocyte abundance. However,  knockdown of ATPase1a1.4 - an abundant Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase localized to epidermal  ionocytes - mitigated TPHP-induced effects on ionocyte abundance but not  pericardial edema, whereas co-exposure of embryos to ouabain - a  Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor - enhanced TPHP-induced pericardial edema but not  ionocyte abundance. Overall, our findings suggest that TPHP may have multiple  mechanisms of toxicity leading to an increase in ionocyte abundance and  pericardial edema within developing zebrafish embryos.},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) have been shown to act as sorbent phases and thus carriers of organic chemicals in the aquatic environment. Therefore, concerns exist that MP  ingestion increases the uptake and accumulation of organic chemicals by aquatic  organisms. However, it is unclear if this pathway is relevant compared to other  exposure pathways. Here we compared the bioconcentration capacity of two  hydrophobic organic chemicals (i.e., chlorpyrifos and hexachlorobenzene) in a  freshwater fish (Danio rerio) when exposed to chemicals through water only and in  combination with contaminated polyethylene MPs. Additionally, a suite of  biomarker analyses (acetylcholine esterase, glutathione S-transferase, alkaline  phosphatase, catalase) was carried out to test whether MPs can enhance the toxic  stress caused by chemicals. Two 14-day semi-static experiments (one for each  chemical) were carried out with adult fish. Each experiment consisted of (1) a  control treatment (no chemicals, no MPs); (2) a treatment in which fish were  exposed to chlorpyrifos or hexachlorobenzene only through water; (3) a treatment  in which fish were exposed to the chemicals through water and contaminated  polyethylene MPs (100 mg MP/L). Two additional treatments were included for the  biomarker analysis. These contained MPs at two different concentrations (5 and  100 mg MP/L) but no chemicals. The presence of contaminated MPs in contaminated  water did not enhance but rather decreased the bioconcentration of both chemicals  in fish compared to the treatment that contained contaminated water in absence of  MPs. This was more pronounced for hexachlorobenzene, which is more hydrophobic  than chlorpyrifos. Enzyme activity levels in fish were only significantly altered  in the presence of MPs for alkaline phosphatase. This study indicates that MP  presence in freshwater ecosystems is not expected to increase the risks  associated with chemical bioconcentration in aquatic organisms and that other  exposure pathways (i.e., uptake via respiration, skin permeability) may be of  higher importance.},

To determine the  environmental risk of pesticides, routine ecotoxicological tests are performed on  several organisms, including standard fish models. However, these typically do  not include fish species from variable habitats and with non-generic  life-histories. In particular, inhabitants from temporary ponds such as annual  killifish are conventionally understood to be resilient to natural stressors  which could translate to higher pesticide resistance or, alternatively, trade-off  with their resistance to pesticides and render them more sensitive than classic  fish models. Using standard exposure tests, we assessed short-term toxicity  effects of two commonly used pesticides, Roundup and cypermethrin, on the annual  killifish Nothobranchius neumanni, and compared its sensitivity with that of  classic fish models. For Roundup, we found a 72 h-LC(50) of 1.79 ± 0.11 mg/L,  which is lower than the values reported for zebrafish, medaka, fathead minnow and  rainbow trout, suggesting that N. neumanni is more sensitive to the compound. The  opposite was true for cypermethrin, with a 72 h-LC(50) of 0.27 ± 0.03 mg/L.  However, these LC(50)-values do not deviate strongly from those reported for  other fish species, supporting earlier findings in the congeneric N. furzeri that  the sensitivity of annual killifish to pollutants is similar to that of classic  fish models despite their assumed robustness to environmental stress.},

RESULTS: The  characteristics of PYR@MSNs were systematically investigated, including  morphology, loading content, ultraviolet (UV) resistance, release behavior,  control effects against pathogens, and safety to nontarget organisms. The results  show that the prepared PYR@MSNs presented characteristics of regular spherical  shapes, uniform particle size (200 nm), high drug loading (38.9\%), and enhanced  UV resistance. Compared with traditional formulation, PYR@MSNs exhibited improved  control effects against Fusarium graminearum, an extended control period, and  lower toxicity to zebrafish, earthworms and BEAS-2B cells. CONCLUSIONS: This  research will facilitate the development of efficient and safe pesticide delivery  systems.

In this  study, we showed that after only 24 h of exposure to environmental concentrations  of carbaryl (0.066-660 ng/L), zebrafish larvae exhibit impairments in essential  behaviours. Interestingly, the observed behavioural effects induced by carbaryl  were acetylcholinesterase-independent. To elucidate the molecular initiating  event that resulted in the observed behavioural effects, in silico predictions  were followed by in vitro validation. We identified two target proteins that  potentially interacted with carbaryl, the α2B adrenoceptor (ADRA2B) and the  serotonin 2B receptor (HTR2B). Using a pharmacological approach, we then tested  the hypothesis that carbaryl had antagonistic interactions with both receptors.  Similar to yohimbine and SB204741, which are prototypic antagonists of ADRA2B and  HTR2B, respectively, carbaryl increased the heart rate of zebrafish larvae. When  we compared the behavioural effects of a 24-h exposure to these pharmacological  antagonists with those of carbaryl, a high degree of similarity was found. These  results strongly suggest that antagonism of both ADRA2B and HTR2B is the  molecular initiating event that leads to adverse outcomes in zebrafish larvae  that have undergone 24 h of exposure to environmentally relevant levels of  carbaryl.},

However,  contradictory results and the neglect of MP aging as a factor have led to a  research gap, which needs to be filled. Our study discovered that polyamide (PA,  a ubiquitous MP in water) MPs clearly facilitated bioaccumulation of  tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) in the F0 zebrafish gonads and  parental transfer of TDCIPP to the F1 offspring. Rapid TDCIPP desorption in the  gut and intestine barrier dysfunction triggered by MPs were the causes for the  phenomenon. In contrast to the pristine forms, aged PA with higher hydrophilcity  exhibited stronger binding and polar interactions with TDCIPP, and the intestine  damage was neglectable, resulting in increased intestinal immobilization and  prevented parental transfer of TDCIPP. Additionally, the aggravated body weight  loss and decreased length of TDCIPP offspring were relieved after PA aging. The  recovery of subintestinal venous plexus angiogenesis, yolk lipid utilization, and  ATP synthesis were responsible for the mitigated transgenerational toxicity. Our  results highlight the significance of aging on the role of MPs with respect to  coexisting pollutants and have great implications for understanding MP-associated  risks.},

OBJECTIVE: This  study was designed to enlighten the importance of the Aldehyde dehydrogenase  enzyme in protecting the dopamine levels in a living system. Camalexin, a  potentially active compound, has been evaluated for its dopamine enhancing and  aldehyde dehydrogenase protecting role in pesticide-induced Parkinson's disease.  METHODS: AutoDock 4.2 software was employed to perform the docking simulations  between the ligand camalexin and standard drugs Alda-1, Ropirinole with three  proteins 4WJR, 3INL, 5AER. Consequently, the compound was evaluated for its in  vivo neuroprotective role in the zebrafish model by attaining Institutional  Animal Ethical Committee permission. The behavioral assessments and catecholamine  analysis in zebrafish were performed. RESULTS: The Autodock result shows that the  ligand camalexin has a lower binding energy (-3.84) that indicates a higher  affinity with the proteins when compared to the standard drug of proteins  (-3.42). In the zebrafish model, behavioral studies provided evidence that  camalexin helps in the improvement of motor functions and cognition. The  catecholamine assay has proved that there is an enhancement in dopamine levels,  as well as an improvement in aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. CONCLUSION: The novel  compound, camalexin, offers a protective role in Parkinson's disease model by its  interaction with neurochemical proteins and also in alternative in vivo model.},

The molluscicides in current use are an effective method for controlling snails.  However, most molluscicides have no slow-release effect and are toxic to  nontarget organisms. Thus, these molluscicides cannot be used on a large scale to  effectively act on snails. In this study, gelatin, a safe and nontoxic substance,  was combined with sustained-release molluscicide and was found to reduce the  toxicity of niclosamide to nontarget organisms. We assessed the effects of  gelatin and molluscicide in controlling P. canaliculata snails and eggs. The  results demonstrated that the niclosamide retention time with 1.0\% and 1.5\%  gelatin sustained-release agents reached 20 days. Additionally, the mortality  rate of P. canaliculata and their eggs increased as the concentration of the  niclosamide sustained-release agents increased. The adult mortality rate of P.  canaliculata reached 50\% after the snails were exposed to gelatin with 0.1 mg/L  niclosamide for 48 h. The hatching rate of P. canaliculata was only 28.5\% of the  normal group after the treatment was applied. The sustained-release molluscicide  at this concentration was less toxic to zebrafish, which means that this  molluscicide can increase the safety of niclosamide to control P. canaliculata in  aquatic environments. In this study, we explored the safety of using niclosamide  sustained-release agents with gelatin against P. canaliculata. The results  suggest that gelatin is an ideal sustained-release agent that can provide a  foundation for subsequent improvements in control of P. canaliculata.},

However, MS detection of small  hydrophilic peptides, in particular, phosphopeptides that bear multiple negative  charges, is challenging due to the insufficient binding to C18 stationary phase.  We described here the development of a new desalting method that takes the unique  properties of polypyrrole (PPY). The presence of positively charged nitrogen  atoms under acidic conditions and polyunsaturated bonds in polypyrrole provide a  prospect for enhanced adsorption of phosphopeptides or hydrophilic peptides  through extra electrostatic and Π-Π stacking interactions in addition to  hydrophobic interactions. In tandem with reversed phase C18 chromatographic  material, the new type of desalting method termed as TMTip(PPY-C18) can  significantly improve the MS detection of phosphopeptides with multiple phosphate  groups and other small hydrophilic peptides. It has been applied to not only  tryptic digest of model proteins but also the analysis of complex lysates of  zebrafish eggs. The number of detected phosphate groups on a peptide ranged from  1 to 6. Particularly, polypyrrole based method can also be used in basic  condition. Thus it provides a useful means to handle peptides that may not be  detectable in acidic condition. It can be envisioned that the TMTip(PPY-C18)  should be able to facilitate the exploration of large scale phosphoproteome.},

It was noted that predation rates of zebrafish were  significantly decreased by 30\% and 100\% after exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L  boscalid, respectively. Adverse alterations in the cell differentiation of eyes  and brain injury were also observed in both larvae and adults following boscalid  exposure. The expression of genes related to neurodevelopment, neurotransmission,  eye development, and visual function, in conjunction with RNA-Seq results,  indicated that boscalid may impair visual phototransduction and nervous system  processes in larval zebrafish. Conclusively, boscalid exposure may affect the  neurobehavioral response of zebrafish by impairing proper visual and nervous  system function.},

Since Mtb is an intracellular pathogen with a  remarkable ability to manipulate host intracellular signaling pathways to escape  from host defense, pharmacological reprogramming of the immune system represents  a novel, potentially powerful therapeutic strategy that should be effective also  against drug-resistant Mtb. Here, we found that host-pathogen interactions in  Mtb-infected primary human macrophages affected host epigenetic features by  modifying histone deacetylase (HDAC) transcriptomic levels. In addition, broad  spectrum inhibition of HDACs enhanced the antimicrobial response of both  pro-inflammatory macrophages (Mϕ1) and anti-inflammatory macrophages (Mϕ2), while  selective inhibition of class IIa HDACs mainly decreased bacterial outgrowth in  Mϕ2. Moreover, chemical inhibition of HDAC activity during differentiation  polarized macrophages into a more bactericidal phenotype with a concomitant  decrease in the secretion levels of inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, in vivo  chemical inhibition of HDAC activity in Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish  embryos, a well-characterized animal model for tuberculosis, significantly  reduced mycobacterial burden, validating our in vitro findings in primary human  macrophages. Collectively, these data identify HDACs as druggable host targets  for HDT against intracellular Mtb.},

This study was designed to  investigate the effects of deguelin on tumor growth and angiogenesis, and the  mechanisms underlying the antitumor activities of deguelin. We show here that  orally administered deguelin inhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor angiogenesis  in mice. Deguelin decreased expression of HIF-1alpha protein and its target  genes, such as VEGF, in a subset of cancer cell lines, including H1299 lung  cancer cells, and vascular endothelial cells in normoxic and hypoxic conditions.  Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor by adenoviral vector  infection abolished the antiangiogenic effects of deguelin on H1299 nonsmall cell  lung cancer cells. Deguelin inhibited de novo synthesis of HIF-1alpha protein and  reduced the half-life of the synthesized protein. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor,  protected the hypoxia- or IGF-induced HIF-1alpha protein from deguelin-mediated  degradation. Our findings suggest that deguelin is a promising antiangiogenic  therapeutic agent in cancer targeting HIF-1alpha. Considering that HIF-1alpha is  overexpressed in a majority of human cancers, deguelin could offer a potent  therapeutic agent for cancer.},

Recent drug repurposing screens have revealed that  niclosamide exhibits diverse mechanisms of action and, as a result, demonstrates  promise for a number of applications, including the treatment of cancer,  bacterial infections, and Zika virus. As new applications of niclosamide will  require non-oral delivery routes that may lead to exposure in utero, the  objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of niclosamide toxicity  during early stages of embryonic development. Using zebrafish as a model, we  found that niclosamide induced a concentration-dependent delay in epiboly  progression during late-blastula and early-gastrula, an effect that was dependent  on exposure during the maternal-to-zygotic transition-a period characterized by  degradation of maternally derived transcripts, zygotic genome activation, and  initiation of cell motility. Moreover, we found that niclosamide did not affect  embryonic oxygen consumption, suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation-a  well-established target for niclosamide within intestinal parasites-may not play  a role in niclosamide-induced epiboly delay. However, mRNA-sequencing revealed  that niclosamide exposure during blastula and early-gastrula significantly  impacted the timing of zygotic genome activation as well as the abundance of  cytoskeleton- and cell cycle regulation-specific transcripts. In addition, we  found that niclosamide inhibited tubulin polymerization in vitro, suggesting that  niclosamide-induced delays in epiboly progression may, in part, be driven by  disruption of microtubule formation and cell motility within the developing  embryo.},

	abstract = {The fish embryo toxicity test has been proposed as an alternative for the acute fish toxicity test, but concerns have been raised for its predictivity given that  a few compounds have been shown to exhibit a weak acute toxicity in the fish  embryo. In order to better define the applicability domain and improve the  predictive capacity of the fish embryo test, we performed a systematic analysis  of existing fish embryo and acute fish toxicity data. A correlation analysis of a  total of 153 compounds identified 28 compounds with a weaker or no toxicity in  the fish embryo test. Eleven of these compounds exhibited a neurotoxic mode of  action. We selected a subset of eight compounds with weaker or no embryo toxicity  (cyanazine, picloram, aldicarb, azinphos-methyl, dieldrin, diquat dibromide,  endosulfan, and esfenvalerate) to study toxicokinetics and a neurotoxic mode of  action as potential reasons for the deviating fish embryo toxicity. Published  fish embryo LC50 values were confirmed by experimental analysis of zebrafish  embryo LC50 according to OECD guideline 236. Except for diquat dibromide,  internal concentration analysis did not indicate a potential relation of the low  sensitivity of fish embryos to a limited uptake of the compounds. Analysis of  locomotor activity of diquat dibromide and the neurotoxic compounds in 98 hpf  embryos (exposed for 96 h) indicated a specific effect on behavior (embryonic  movement) for the neurotoxic compounds. The EC50s of behavior for neurotoxic  compounds were close to the acute fish toxicity LC50. Our data provided the first  evidence that the applicability domain of the fish embryo test (LC50s  determination) may exclude neurotoxic compounds. However, neurotoxic compounds  could be identified by changes in embryonic locomotion. Although a quantitative  prediction of acute fish toxicity LC50 using behavioral assays in fish embryos  may not yet be possible, the identification of neurotoxicity could trigger the  conduction of a conventional fish acute toxicity test or application of  assessment factors while considering the very good fish embryo-acute fish  toxicity correlation for other compounds.},

Our study sought  to explore the neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 in 1‑methyl‑4‑phenyl pyridine ion  (MPP+)-induced cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SH-SY5Y  cells were cultured in vitro, pretreated with Gal-1, and then exposed to MPP+.  Thereafter, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells was  investigated. The effects of Gal-1 on DNA breakage, cell damage (release of  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), viability, and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells were  examined by comet assay, LDH assay, WST-1 assay, and flow cytometry,  respectively. Additionally, the regulatory effect of Gal-1 on Nrf2 expression was  examined by western blot. Zebrafish embryos were pretreated with Gal-1 and then  exposed to MPP+. The locomotor ability of zebrafish larvae was then investigated.  RESULTS: MPP+ induced the production of ROS in cells, which can be alleviated by  pretreatment with Gal-1. Gal-1 protected cells from MPP+-induced cytotoxicity by  preventing DNA breakage and cell injury. Gal-1 inhibited apoptosis in SH-SY5Y  cells. The neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 could be abolished when Nrf2  expression knockdown. Moreover, exposure to MPP+ decreased the locomotor activity  of zebrafish, which was attenuated by pretreatment with Gal-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our  study demonstrated that the administration of Gal-1 could protect neurons from  cellular stress by preventing apoptosis and eliminating ROS. Moreover, the  neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 in neuronal cells could be related to the  activation of Nrf2 expression. Therefore, Gal-1 could be a promising strategy for  treating PD.},

Effects of exposure to  these compounds over generations are poorly documented. Therefore, our aims were  to characterize behavioral responses and underlying molecular mechanisms in  zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs and PBDEs as  well as in four unexposed offspring generations. Zebrafish (F0) were chronically  exposed from the first meal onward to a diet spiked with a mixture containing 22  PCB and 7 PBDE congeners in proportions and concentrations reflecting  environmental situations (ΣPCBs = 1991 and ΣPBDEs = 411 ng/g). Four offspring  generations (F1 to F4) were obtained from this F0 and were not further exposed.  Behavior was assessed at both larval and adult stages. Mechanisms related to  behavioral defects (habenula maturation and c-fos transcription) and methylation  (dnmts transcription) were monitored in larvae. Exposed adult F0 as well as F1  and F3 adults displayed no behavioral change while F2 expressed anxiety-like  behavior. Larval behavior was also disrupted, i.e. hyperactive after light to  dark transition in F1 or hypoactive in F2, F3 and F4. Behavioral disruptions may  be related to defect in habenula maturation (observed in F1) and change in c-fos  transcription (observed in F1 and F2). Transcription of the gene encoding DNA  methyltransferase (dnmt3ba) was also modified in all generations. Our results  lead us to hypothesize that chronic dietary exposure to an environmentally  relevant mixture of PCB and PBDE triggers multigenerational and transgenerational  molecular and behavioral disruptions in a vertebrate model.},

In this study, a method for determination of  trace MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites in zebrafish by surface-coated probe  nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SCP-nanoESI-MS) was developed. A  microscale solid-phase microextraction (SPME) probe was developed and used for  extraction and enrichment of trace MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites in  zebrafish after exposure. After that, the loaded SPME probe was directly employed  for nanoESI-MS analysis under ambient and open-air conditions. Under the optimum  conditions, the method demonstrated good linearity, with correlation coefficient  values (r(2)) no less than 0.9925. The limits of detection and quantification  were 0.014-0.023 ng mL(-1) and 0.046-0.077 ng mL(-1), respectively. By using the  proposed method, the bioaccumulation of MG and CV in zebrafish was investigated,  and the distribution of MG, CV, and their leuco metabolites in different organs  of zebrafish was studied.

GlcN also exerted a promotory effect on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under normal  glucose conditions (NG, 5 mM) and liver of normal fed zebrafish larvae. High  glucose (HG, 25 mM)-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by  l-glutamine-d-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitors. ER stress  inhibitors did not suppress HG or GlcN-mediated lipid accumulation. HG and GlcN  stimulated protein expression, DNA binding and O-GlcNAcylation of  carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). Furthermore, both HG  and GlcN increased nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1)  levels in HepG2 cells. In contrast to its stimulatory effect under NG, GlcN  suppressed lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under HG conditions. Similarly, GlcN  suppressed lipid accumulation in livers of overfed zebrafish. In addition, GlcN  activity on DNA binding and O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP was stimulatory under NG  and inhibitory under HG conditions. Moreover, GlcN enhanced ChREBP, SREBP-1c,  ACC, FAS, L-PK and SCD-1 mRNA expression under NG but inhibited HG-induced  upregulation in HepG2 cells. The O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor, alloxan, reduced  lipid accumulation by HG or GlcN while the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, PUGNAc,  enhanced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and liver of zebrafish larvae.  GlcN-induced lipid accumulation was inhibited by the AMPK activator, AICAR.  Phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) was suppressed by GlcN under NG while increased  by GlcN under HG. PUGNAc downregulated p-AMPK while alloxan restored GlcN- or  HG-induced p-AMPK inhibition.

	abstract = {In the experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a well-known neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine or MPTP, pesticides like benomyl,  paraquat,etc. are successfully used to induce a Parkinson's disease in human and  nonhuman primates, which can be reversed by the drugs such as L-DOPA. A review on  the alternative methods and alternative models in Parkinson's disease is  documented here to understand their advantages and importance. Earlier  researchers proved MPTP is effective in the goldfish, which reliably mirrors the  neurochemical and behavioral changes caused by MPTP in the higher vertebrates.  Gold fish brain has the "nucleus pars medialis," similar to the substanitia nigra  of the human brain can be destructed by chemicals like MPTP, 6-hydroxydopamine  and has selective protection by L-Dopa (Levodopa) and MAO-B (Monoamine oxidase B)  inhibitors. In addition, zebrafish along with mice was successfully employed in  the study of pesticides leading to neurodegeneration in PD. As the current animal  models often couldn't replicate the true pathophysiology of idiopathic PD,  alternative models have gained importance in the research. Upon having a glance  at different models utilized in Parkinson's disease studies, one can get an idea  on preferring alternative models, especially the zebra fish model in the study of  neurodegenerative disorders.},

Although uses of lead have been  restricted, lead persists in our environment especially in older homes, and  generally in soil and water. Although extensive studies have determined that  fetal and childhood exposures to lead have been associated with childhood and  adolescent memory impairments and learning disabilities, there are limited  studies investigating early neural and morphological effects that may lead to  these behavioral and learning abnormalities. Here we utilize the zebrafish  vertebrate model system to study early effects of lead exposure on the brain. We  treat embryos with 0.2mM lead for 24, 48 and 72 h and analyze neural structures  through live imagery and transgenic approaches. We find structural abnormalities  in the hindbrain region as well as changes in branchiomotor neuron development  and altered neural vasculature. Additionally, we find areas of increased  apoptosis. We conclude that lead is developmentally neurotoxic to a specific  region of the brain, the hindbrain and is toxic to branchiomotor neurons residing  in rhombomeres 2 through 7 of the hindbrain and hindbrain central artery  vasculature.},

Its chirality makes the  adverse effects more complicated. This study aimed at the enantioselective  cardiotoxicity in developmental zebrafish induced by racemic  (rac-)/S-/R-fluoxetine. The accumulation profiles demonstrated that  biotransformation of fluoxetine to norfluoxetine occurred during rac-fluoxetine  exposure, with a higher enrichment of S-norfluoxetine than R-norfluoxetine. Heart  malformations including pericardial edema, circulation abnormalities, and  thrombosis were observed, and enantioselective changes also occurred. According  to H\&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining, the loose severity of cardiac  structure and cardiac fibrosis in rac-norfluoxetine treated group was worse than  that in fluoxetine treated groups. Results of toxicity-associated parameters in  our homochiral enantiomers' exposure also indicated that the toxicity induced by  S-fluoxetine was more severe than R-fluoxetine. Enantioselective arrhythmia in  developmental zebrafish after chiral fluoxetine exposure could be caused by  myocardial fibrosis, abnormal developmental processes, and the biotransformation  of fluoxetine to norfluoxetine could make that worse. Our findings can be used to  assess the environmental risk of the two enantiomers of fluoxetine that induce  cardiotoxicity in aquatic organisms.},

A site-specific nanorelease system of dazomet (DZ) was  proposed by employing the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 composite (DZ@ZIF-8)  by a one-pot method. The synthetic parameters of DZ@ZIF-8 were optimized, and the  loading content of DZ was maximized. ZIF-8 endowed DZ with a pH-sensitive  behavior. The collapse of the DZ@ZIF-8 structure and the site-specific release of  DZ were triggered by acidic substances produced by Botrytis cinerea. In vitro and  pot experiments showed that the fungicidal activity of DZ@ZIF-8 was about 36.3  and 42.7\% higher than that of DZ, respectively. DZ is conventionally used before  a crop is planted because of its volatility and toxicity. However, DZ@ZIF-8 could  avoid phytotoxicity of DZ to plants, which made the application of DZ possible  during plant growth. Moreover, the acute toxicity to zebrafish changed from high  to moderate levels. This study highlights a potential strategy that improves DZ  effective utilization and reduces side effects.},

	abstract = {Metal-based nanoparticles exhibiting antimicrobial activity are of emerging concern to human and environmental health. In addition to their direct adverse  effects to plants and animals, indirect effects resulting from disruption of  beneficial host-microbiota interactions may contribute to the toxicity of these  particles. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the acute toxicity of silver  and zinc oxide nanoparticles (nAg and nZnO) to zebrafish larvae that were either  germ-free or colonized by microbiota. Over two days of exposure, germ-free  zebrafish larvae were more sensitive to nAg than microbially colonized larvae,  whereas silver ion toxicity did not differ between germ-free and colonized  larvae. Using response addition modeling, we confirmed that the protective effect  of colonizing microbiota against nAg toxicity was particle-specific. Nearly all  mortality among germ-free larvae occurred within the first day of exposure. In  contrast, mortality among colonized larvae increased gradually over both exposure  days. Concurrent with this gradual increase in mortality was a marked reduction  in the numbers of live host-associated microbes, suggesting that bactericidal  effects of nAg on protective microbes resulted in increased mortality among  colonized larvae over time. No difference in sensitivity between germ-free and  colonized larvae was observed for nZnO, which dissolved rapidly in the exposure  medium. At sublethal concentrations, these particles moreover did not exert  detectable bactericidal effects on larvae-associated microbes. Altogether, our  study shows the importance of taking host-microbe interactions into account in  assessing toxic effects of nanoparticles to microbially colonized hosts, and  provides a method to screen for microbiota interference with nanomaterial  toxicity.},

In this study, zebrafish were firstly exposed to  ACT (0.18-0.36 ng/mL) from 2 hpf (hours post fertilization) to 30 dpf (days post  fertilization), and a series of developmental toxicological endpoints and thyroid  hormones were measured. Result showed that no developmental toxicity to zebrafish  was found in 0.18 and 0.24 ng/mL groups except decreased body weight (30 dpf,  0.24 ng/mL). However, exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT led to reductions in heartbeat  (48 hpf), hatching rate (72 hpf) and bodyweight (30 dpf). General tendencies of  decreases in free T3 but increases in free T4 and reductions in ratio of free  T3/T4 were also found, inferring that type II deiodinase (Dio2) was repressed.  This inference was confirmed by Western analysis that Dio2 expression reduced by  42.7\% after 0.36 ng/mL ACT treatment. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis implied that  exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT altered the genome-wide gene expression profiles of  zebrafish. Totally 5660 genes (involving 3154 down-regulated and 2596  up-regulated genes) were differentially expressed, and 13 deferentially expressed  genes including down-regulated dio2 were significantly enriched in thyroid  hormone signaling pathway. Subsequently, an in vitro thyroid receptor-reporter  gene assay using GH3 cells was performed to further explore the potential  disrupting mechanism. Result showed that luciferase activity slightly increased  after exposure to ACT alone or ACT combined with low level T3, but was suppressed  when combined with high level T3. It indicted there probably existed a  competitive relationship in some extent between ACT and T3 in vivo. Overall, the  present study provided preliminary evidences that long-term exposure to trace ACT  repressed Dio2 expression, declined T3 and then activated thyroid  receptor-mediated signaling, thereby leading to integrated thyroid endocrine  disruption in zebrafish larvae.},

Clinical trials are now underway to validate their use in  anticancer or anti-HIV treatments. However, their mechanisms of action remain  unclear. A challenging question is whether the gold phosphine complex is a  prodrug that is administered in an inactive precursor form or rather that the  gold atom remains attached to the phosphine ligand during treatment. In this  study, we present two novel gold complexes, which we compared to auranofin and to  their phosphonium analogue. The chosen ligand is a phosphine-based smart probe,  whose strong fluorescence depends on the presence of the gold atom. The in vitro  biological action of the gold complexes and the phosphonium derivative were  investigated, and a preliminary in vivo study in healthy zebrafish larvae allowed  us to evaluate gold complex biodistribution and toxicity. The different analyses  carried out showed that these gold complexes were stable and behaved differently  from phosphonium and auranofin, both in vitro and in vivo. Two-photon microscopy  experiments demonstrated that the cellular targets of these gold complexes are  not the same as those of the phosphonium analogue. Moreover, despite similar IC50  values in some cancer cell lines, gold complexes displayed a low toxicity in  vivo, in contrast to the phosphonium salt. They are therefore suitable for future  in vivo investigations.},

However, data is scarce in several of such  countries, including Panama. Thus, in this work, the ecotoxicological status of  selected rivers in Panama with distinct input sources were evaluated using the  zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo bioassays combined with a liquid  chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry screening of contaminants of  emerging concern (CECs), using a library of over 3200 chemicals. A total of 68  CECs, including pharmaceuticals and metabolites, pesticides and several  industrial chemicals, could be tentatively identified. Additionally, the  zebrafish embryo bioassays showed a significant increase (p {\textless} 0.05) in embryo  mortality/abnormalities when incubated with water samples from two rivers,  Matasnillo and Curundú (47.5\% and 32\%, respectively). Importantly, a positive  correlation between ecotoxicological endpoints and some of the detected CECs was  observed. The findings demonstrate that both rivers are under strong  anthropogenic pressure, and therefore, management actions are urgently needed to  decrease their level of contamination. Overall, this study further supports the  use of the zebrafish embryo bioassay as a fast, high throughput approach for  screening the toxicity of water samples, and highlights the advantages of  combining ecotoxicological assays with high-resolution mass spectrometry to an  expedite assessment of the ecotoxicological status of water bodies.},

Pan-HDAC inhibitors provided neuroprotection in  Parkinson's Disease (PD) models, however, the HDAC isoforms with highest  neuroprotective potential remain unknown. Zebrafish larvae (powerful  pharmacological testing tools bridging cellular and in vivo studies) have thus  far been used in PD modelling with limited phenotypic characterization. Here we  characterize the behavioural and metabolic phenotypes of a zebrafish PD model  induced with MPP(+), assess the feasibility of targeting zebrafish HDAC1 and  HDAC6 isoforms, and test the in vivo effects of their selective inhibitors MS-275  and tubastatin A, respectively. MPP(+) induced a concentration-dependent decrease  in metabolic activity and sensorimotor reflexes, and induced locomotor  impairments rescuable by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. Zebrafish HDAC1  and HDAC6 isoforms show high sequence identity with mammalian homologues at the  deacetylase active sites, and pharmacological inhibition increased acetylation of  their respective histone and tubulin targets. MS-275 and tubastatin rescued the  MPP(+)-induced decrease in diencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence  and in whole-larvae metabolic activity, without modifying mitochondrial complex  activity or biogenesis. MS-275 or tubastatin alone modulated spontaneous  locomotion. When combined with MPP(+), however, neither MS-275 nor tubastatin  rescued locomotor impairments, although tubastatin did ameliorate the head-reflex  impairment. This study demonstrates the feasibility of pharmacologically  targeting the zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and indicates that their  inhibition can rescue cellular metabolism in a PD model. Absence of improvement  in locomotion, however, suggests that monotherapy with either HDAC1 or HDAC6  inhibitors is unlikely to provide strong benefits in PD. This study highlights  parameters dependent on the integrity of zebrafish neuronal circuits as a  valuable complement to cell-based studies. Also, the demonstrated feasibility of  pharmacologically targeting HDAC1 and HDAC6 in this organism paves the way for  future studies investigating HDAC inhibitors in other diseases modelled in  zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Mosquitoes are arthropods of huge medical and veterinary relevance, since they vector pathogens and parasites of public health importance, including malaria,  dengue and Zika virus. Currently, nanotechnology is considered a potential  eco-friendly approach in mosquito control research. We proposed a novel method of  biofabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using chitosan (Ch) from crab  shells. Ch-AgNP nanocomposite was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR,  SEM, EDX and XRD. Ch-AgNP were tested against larvae and pupae of the malaria  vector Anopheles stephensi obtaining LC50 ranging from 3.18 ppm (I) to 6.54 ppm  (pupae). The antibacterial properties of Ch-AgNP were proved against Bacillus  subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi, while no growth inhibition  was reported in assays conducted on Proteus vulgaris. Concerning non-target  effects, in standard laboratory considtions the predation efficiency of Danio  rerio zebrafishes was 68.8\% and 61.6\% against I and II instar larvae of A.  stephensi, respectively. In a Ch-AgNP-contaminated environment, fish predation  was boosted to 89.5\% and 77.3\%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of  antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and LPO from hepatopancreas of fresh water crabs  Paratelphusa hydrodromous exposed for 16 days to a Ch-AgNP-contaminated aquatic  environment were conducted. Notably, deleterious effects of Ch-AgNP contaminating  aquatic enviroment on the non-target crab P. hydrodromous were observed,  particularly when doses higher than 8-10ppm are tested. Overall, this research  highlights the potential of Ch-AGNP for the development of newer control tools  against young instar populations of malaria mosquitoes, also highlighting some  risks concerned the employ of nanoparticles in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {Iron is essential for organisms. It is mainly utilized in mitochondria for biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, hemes and other cofactors. Mitoferrin 1 and  mitoferrin 2, two homologues proteins belonging to the mitochondrial solute  carrier family, are required for iron delivery into mitochondria. Mitoferrin 1 is  highly expressed in developing erythrocytes which consume a large amount of iron  during hemoglobinization. Mitoferrin 2 is ubiquitously expressed, whose functions  are less known. Zebrafish with mitoferrin 1 mutation show profound hypochromic  anaemia and erythroid maturation arrests, and yeast with defects in MRS3/4, the  counterparts of mitoferrin 1/2, has low mitochondrial iron levels and grows  poorly by iron depletion. Mitoferrin 1 expression is up-regulated in yeast and  mouse models of Fiedreich's ataxia disease and in human cell culture models of  Parkinson disease, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases  with mitochondrial iron accumulation. In this study we found that reduced  mitoferrin levels in C. elegans by RNAi treatment causes pleiotropic phenotypes  such as small body size, reduced fecundity, slow movement and increased  sensitivity to paraquat. Despite these abnormities, lifespan was increased by 50\%  to 80\% in N2 wild type strain, and in further studies using the RNAi sensitive  strain eri-1, more than doubled lifespan was observed. The pathways or mechanisms  responsible for the lifespan extension and other phenotypes of mitoferrin RNAi  worms are worth further study, which may contribute to our understanding of aging  mechanisms and the pathogenesis of iron disorder related diseases.},

	abstract = {To identify small molecules that shield mammalian sensory hair cells from the ototoxic side effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics, 10,240 compounds were  initially screened in zebrafish larvae, selecting for those that protected  lateral-line hair cells against neomycin and gentamicin. When the 64 hits from  this screen were retested in mouse cochlear cultures, 8 protected outer hair  cells (OHCs) from gentamicin in vitro without causing hair-bundle damage. These 8  hits shared structural features and blocked, to varying degrees, the OHC's  mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel, a route of aminoglycoside entry into  hair cells. Further characterization of one of the strongest MET channel  blockers, UoS-7692, revealed it additionally protected against kanamycin and  tobramycin and did not abrogate the bactericidal activity of gentamicin. UoS-7692  behaved, like the aminoglycosides, as a permeant blocker of the MET channel;  significantly reduced gentamicin-Texas red loading into OHCs; and preserved  lateral-line function in neomycin-treated zebrafish. Transtympanic injection of  UoS-7692 protected mouse OHCs from furosemide/kanamycin exposure in vivo and  partially preserved hearing. The results confirmed the hair-cell MET channel as a  viable target for the identification of compounds that protect the cochlea from  aminoglycosides and provide a series of hit compounds that will inform the design  of future otoprotectants.},

	abstract = {The most conserved part of the vertebrate dopaminergic system is the orthopedia (otp)-expressing diencephalic neuronal population that constitutes the  dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT). Although studies in the neonatal  murine spinal cord in vitro suggest an early locomotor role of the DDT, the  function of the DDT in developing vertebrates in vivo remains unknown. Here, we  investigated the role of the DDT in the locomotor development of zebrafish  larvae. To assess the development of the behavioral and neural locomotor pattern,  we used high-throughput video tracking in combination with peripheral nerve  recordings. We found a behavioral and neural correspondence in the developmental  switch from an immature to mature locomotor pattern. Blocking endogenous dopamine  receptor 4 (D(4)R) signaling in vivo either before or after the developmental  switch prevented or reversed the switch, respectively. Spinal transections of  post-switch larvae reestablished the immature locomotor pattern, which was  rescued to a mature-like pattern via spinal D(4)R agonism. Selective chemogenetic  ablation of otp b (otpb) neurons that contribute to the DDT perpetuated the  immature locomotor pattern in vivo. This phenotype was recapitulated by  diencephalic transections that removed the dopaminergic otpb population and was  rescued to a mature-like locomotor pattern by D(4)R agonism. We conclude that the  dopaminergic otpb population, via the DDT, is responsible for spinal D(4)R  signaling to mediate the developmental switch to the mature locomotor pattern of  zebrafish. These results, integrated with the mammalian literature, suggest that  the DDT represents an evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory system that is  necessary for normal vertebrate locomotor development.},

In the present study we performed laboratory  aquarium experiments and modeling to explore how PCB sorption in sediments  impacted exposure pathways and bioaccumulation in fish. Results showed that  freely dissolved PCBs in porewater and overlying water measured by passive  sampling were reduced by more than 95\% upon amendment with 4.5\% fine granular AC.  The amendment also reduced the PCB uptake in fish by 87\% after 90 days of  exposure. Measured freely dissolved concentrations were incorporated in  equilibrium and kinetic models for predicting uptake by fish. Predicted uptake  using the kinetic model was generally within a factor of 2 for total PCBs  measured in fish. The kinetic model output was most sensitive to overlying water  PCBs, lipid fraction, and dissolved oxygen concentration (regulating gill  ventilation). Our results indicate that by incorporating changes in freely  dissolved PCB concentrations in bioaccumulation models it is possible to predict  effectiveness of sediment remediation in reducing PCB uptake in fish.},

To detect the effects on development, embryos of 6 h  post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 μg/L, 20 μg/L, 40 μg/L OxCu for 18 h;  meanwhile, to evaluate the effects on the behavior, larval fish at 6 days  post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to the same concentrations for 24 h. Here,  we show that there are embryonic developmental defects, including abnormalities  of head and trunk, brain ventricle atrophy, reduced newborn neurons, disordered  neurons, increased intercellular space, concentrated cytoplasm, decreased heart  beat and blood flow velocity, and developmental delay of the vascular system; in  addition, some embryos exposed to the high concentration of OxCu degraded from  the tail. We also found that the spontaneous tail coiling frequency and AChE  enzyme activity were reduced, while oxidative stress (free radical damage) and  cell apoptosis were significantly increased. Moreover, the expression of genes  involved in neurodevelopment, vascular development and apoptosis were  dysregulated in the OxCu exposed embryos in a concentration-dependent manner.  Finally, we found that after exposure to OxCu, larval locomotor activity was  decreased and accompanied by Parkinson-like (increased absolute turn angle and  sinuosity) and anxiety-like (preferred to the central area) behavior. These  results indicate that OxCu induces developmental toxicity and behavioral  alterations by affecting AChE enzyme activity and oxidative stress.

They have been in the focus of medical toxicological research  for more than a decade due to their key role in absorption, distribution,  metabolism and excretion due to their expression on basolateral membranes of  various barrier tissues. OCTs belong to the SLC22A family within the SLC (Solute  carrier) protein superfamily, with three co-orthologs identified in humans (OCT1,  2 and 3), and two Oct orthologs in zebrafish (Oct1 and Oct2). The structural and  functional properties of zebrafish Octs, along with their toxicological  relevance, have still not been explored. In this study, we performed a functional  characterization of zebrafish Oct1 using transient and stable heterologous  expression systems and model fluorescent substrates as the basis for interaction  studies with a wide range of endo- and xenobiotics. We also conducted a basic  topology analysis and homology modeling to determine the structure and membrane  localization of Oct1. Finally, we performed an MTT assay to evaluate the toxic  effects of the seven interactors identified - oxaliplatin, cisplatin, berberine,  MPP(+), prazosin, paraquat and mitoxantrone - in human embryonic kidney cells  (HEK293T) stably expressing zebrafish Oct1 (HEK293T-drOct1 cells). Our results  show that the zebrafish Oct1 structure consists of 12 transmembrane alpha  helices, which form the active region with more than one active site. Five new  fluorescent substrates of Oct1 were identified: ASP+ (K(m)=26μM), rhodamine 123  (K(m)=103.7nM), berberine (K(m)=3.96μM), DAPI (K(m)=780nM), and ethidium bromide  (K(m)=97nM). Interaction studies revealed numerous interactors that inhibited the  Oct1-dependent uptake of fluorescent substrates. The identified interactors  ranged from physiological compounds (mainly steroid hormones) to different  classes of xenobiotics, with IC(50) values in nanomolar (e.g., pyrimethamine and  prazosin) to millimolar range (e.g., cimetidine). Cytotoxicity experiments with  HEK293T-drOct1 cells enabled us to identify berberine, oxaliplatin and MPP+ as  substrates of Oct1.

The limited  diversity and efficacy of clinical antifungal drugs, exacerbated by emerging drug  resistance, have resulted in the failure of current antifungal therapies. This  imposes an urgent demand for the development of innovative strategies for  effective eradication of candidal infections. While the existing clinical drugs  display fungicidal or fungistatic activity, the strategy specifically targeting  C. albicans filamentation, as the most important virulence trait, represents an  attractive approach for overcoming the drawbacks related to clinical antifungals.  The results acquired in this study revealed the significant potential of  5-aminotetrazoles as a new class of effective and safe anti-virulence agents.  Moreover, these novel agents were active when applied both alone and in  combination with clinically approved polyenes. Complete prevention of C. albicans  morphogenetic yeast-to-hyphae transition was achieved at doses as low as 1.3 μM  under conditions mimicking various filamentation-responsive stimuli in the human  body, while no cardio- or hepatotoxicity was observed at doses as high as 200 μM.  The treatment of C. albicans-infected zebrafish embryos with nystatin alone had  low efficacy, while the combination of nystatin and selected 5-aminotetrazoles  prevented fungal filamentation, successfully eliminating the infection and  rescuing the infected embryos from lethal disseminated candidiasis. In addition,  the most potent anti-virulence 5-aminotetrazole prevented C. albicans in  developing the resistance to nystatin when applied in combination, keeping the  fungus sensitive to the antifungal drug.},

This is the first  report on using pyridinium chloride mediated mesoporous MnHAp nanorods synthesis.  Pure and Mn doped HAp samples were examined using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray  powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)  studies to confirm the prepared HAp nanorods. Furthermore, the fabrication of  manganese-doped HAp was successful with the formation of a hexagonal crystal  lattice without disturbing the HAp phase. It is because, at the time of  synthesis, PO(4)(3-) ions form an electrostatic interaction with the Mn ions.  Furthermore, Mn-doped HAp samples showed a reduction in their sizes of 15, 10-15,  5-10 nm width, and 80-100, 10-15, 20-30 nm length with varied pore diameters and  surface area.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AIMS: Combining the use of transfection reagents and physical methods can markedly improve the efficiency of gene delivery; however, such methods often  cause cell damage. Additionally, naked plasmids without any vector or physical  stimulation are difficult to deliver into stem cells. In this study, we  demonstrate a simple and rapid method to simultaneously facilitate efficient in  situ naked gene delivery and form a bioactive hydrogel scaffold. METHODS:  Transfecting naked GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) plasmids into human umbilical  cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) by co-extruding naked plasmids and  hUC-MSCs with a biomimetic and negatively charged water-based biodegradable  thermo-responsive polyurethane (PU) hydrogel through a microextrusion-based  transient-transfection system can upregulate the other cardiac marker genes.  RESULTS: The PU hydrogels with optimized physicochemical properties (such as  hard-soft segment composition, size, hardness and thermal gelation) induced  GATA4-transfected hUC-MSCs to express the cardiac marker proteins and then  differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells in 15 days. We further demonstrated  that GATA4-transfected hUC-MSCs in PU hydrogel were capable of in situ revival of  heart function in zebrafish in 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that  hUC-MSCs and naked plasmids encapsulated in PU hydrogels might represent a new  strategy for in situ tissue therapy using the microextrusion-based  transient-transfection system described here. This transfection system is simple,  effective and safer than conventional technologies.},

Pollution profiles of five sampling sites  along the River Sava were assessed by simultaneous chemical analysis of 562  organic contaminants (OCs) of which 476 were detected. At each sampling site,  pharmaceuticals/illicit drugs category was mostly represented by their cumulative  concentration, followed by categories industrial chemicals, pesticides and  hormones. An exposure-activity ratio (EAR) approach based on ToxCast data  highlighted steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics,  antiepileptics/neuroleptics, industrial chemicals and hormones as compounds with  the highest biological potential. Summed EAR-based prediction of toxicity showed  a good correlation with the estimated toxicity of assessed sampling sites using  WOBs. WOBs did not exhibit increased mortality but caused various sub-lethal  biological responses that were dependant relative to the sampling site pollution  intensity as well as species sensitivity. Exposure of G. fossarum and D. magna to  river water-induced lower feeding rates increased GST activity and TBARS levels.  Zebrafish D. rerio embryo exhibited a significant decrease in heartbeat rate,  failure in pigmentation formation, as well as inhibition of ABC transporters.  Nuclear receptor activation was indicated as the biological target of greatest  concern based on the EAR approach. A combined approach of short-term WOBs, with a  special emphasis on sub-lethal endpoints, and chemical characterization of water  samples compared against in vitro toxicity data from the ToxCast database and RQs  can provide a comprehensive insight into the negative effect of pollutants on  aquatic organisms.},

However, the neurotoxic potential of bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol  S (BPS) at developmental windows remains unclear. To investigate the mechanisms  mediating the developmental neurotoxicity, zebrafish embryos were treated with  0.01, 0.03, 0.01, 0.3, 1 μM BPA/BPS. Also, we used Tg(HuC:GFP) zebrafish to  investigate whether BPA/BPS could induce neuron development. The reduction in  body length, and increased heart rate were significant in 0.3 and 1 μM BPA/BPS  groups. The green fluorescence protein (GFP) intensity increased at 72 hpf and  120 hpf in Tg(HuC:GFP) larvae which was consistent with the increased mRNA  expression of elval3 following BPS treatments, an indication of the plausible  effect of BPS on embryonic neuron development. Additionally, BPA/BPS treatments  elicited hyperactivity and reduced static time in zebrafish larvae, suggesting  behavioral alterations. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed that BPA and BPS could  interfere with the normal expression of development-related genes vegfa, wnt8a,  and mstn1 at the developmental stages. The expression of neurodevelopment-related  genes (ngn1, elavl3, gfap, α1-tubulin, mbp, and gap43) were significantly  upregulated in BPA and BPS treatments, except for the remarkable downregulation  of mbp and gfap elicited by BPA at 48 (0.03 μM) and 120 hpf (0.3 μM)  respectively; ngn1 at 48 hpf for 0.1 μM BPS. Overall, our results highlighted  that embryonic exposure to low concentrations of BPA/BPS could be deleterious to  the central nervous system development and elicit behavioral abnormalities in  zebrafish at developmental stages.},

	abstract = {Flutolanil is a broad-spectrum amide fungicide that is widely used to prevent fungal pathogens in agriculture. However, its usage may have a potential  environmental impact on organisms. So far, few literatures have investigated the  chronic toxicity of flutolanil at concentrations relevant to environmental  conditions in the nontarget aquatic organisms. This study was aimed at evaluating  whether the long-term exposure of flutolanil affects oxidative stress, immune  response, and apoptosis in the liver of zebrafish ( Danio rerio). The results  showed that the activity of catalase (CAT) was significantly decreased in the  liver in all flutolanil-treated groups. Interestingly, the malondialdehyde (MDA)  contents were remarkably increased following the flutolanil exposure.  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage was increased with a concentration-dependent  manner. The transcription level of genes involved in apoptosis and the immune  system were significantly altered following flutolanil chronic exposure in  zebrafish liver. Furthermore, the caspase-3 enzyme activity was significantly  increased. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the resulting effects on  oxidative stress, immune toxicity, and apoptosis may be responsible for the  pathological alterations in zebrafish liver after flutolanil exposure at  concentrations relevant to environmental conditions, advancing the knowledge of  pesticide environmental risk assessment.},

In this study, we attempted to determine whether pentylenetetrazol (a GABAergic  receptor antagonist, PTZ)-induced seizures influence cell proliferation in  zebrafish larvae (5 and 15 days of post-fertilization), using bromodeoxyuridine  (BrdU) to label dividing cells. In the brains of 5 dpf larvae, PTZ treatment  significantly reduced the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the telencephalic area  (pallium and subpallium), diencephalic area (thalamus and preoptic area), medial  tectal proliferation zone, and medial cerebellar proliferation zone to 52.4\%,  62.9\%, 47.2\%, and 54.0\% of the controls, respectively. In contrast, we noted no  reductions in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the brains of the 15 dpf  larvae. The double-label of BrdU and Hu, a neuronal marker, demonstrated that the  majority of newborn cells showed the neuronal phenotype. Similarly, kainic acid  (200 microM), a glutamatergic receptor agonist, significantly reduced the number  of BrdU-labeled cells in the telencephalic area, diencephalic area, and medial  tectal proliferation zone to 51.4\%, 61.9\%, and 40.4\% of the controls,  respectively. Physostigmine (500 microM), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, also  reduced the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the telencephalic area, diencephalic  area, medial tectal proliferation zone, and medial cerebellar proliferation zone  to 52.8\%, 35.9\%, 30.5\%, and 39.8\% of the controls, respectively. All of these  drugs resulted in electrographic seizures in the larval brain when perfused  directly through artificial cerebrospinal fluid. These results indicated that  seizures result in a massive reduction in cell proliferation in wide-ranging  areas of the developing brain.},

The EU-ToxRisk project developed a strategy to provide regulatorily  valid data, and exemplified this using a panel of {\textgreater} 20 assays (with {\textgreater} 50  individual endpoints), each exposed to 19 well-known test compounds (e.g.  rotenone, colchicine, mercury, paracetamol, rifampicine, paraquat, taxol).

Moreover, data generation was exemplified  by providing results from 25 reporter assays. A complete evaluation of the entire  test battery will be described elsewhere. A major learning from the retrospective  analysis of this large testing project was the need for thorough definitions of  the above strategy aspects, ideally in form of a study pre-registration, to allow  adequate interpretation of the data and to ensure overall  scientific/toxicological validity.},

The aim of this  study was to examine the toxicity of different extracts obtained from either  traditional or organic cultivated yerba mate in vitro and in vivo. Aqueous,  ethanolic and methanolic extracts were obtained from commercial samples of yerba  mate and total phenolic content was determined employing Folin-Ciocalteau  reagent. The aqueous extracts presented higher content of total phenols, compared  to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, and also demonstrated lower cytotoxicity,  which is the basis for testing were carried out only using aqueous extracts. The  main phenolic acids found in traditional aqueous (TA) extract were chlorogenic,  gallic and protocatechuic acids. Gallic and hydroxybenzoic acids were detected in  aqueous cultivated organic (OA) extract. Pretreatment with OA extract (100 µg/ml,  1 hr) was cytoprotective against rotenone-induced toxicity (1 µM). For in vivo  toxicity assay, zebrafish embryos were exposed to OA or TA extracts  (10-160 µg/ml) at 4 hr post fertilization. TA extract decreased embryos survival  in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced the hatching rate at 40 µg/ml,  increased edema frequency at 80 µg/ml and altered body curvature at 120 µg/ml.  Further, TA extract produced locomotor disorders at concentrations equal to or  greater than 10 µg/ml. In contrast, OA extract exhibited no apparent toxic effect  on organogenesis and behavior up to 100 µg/ml. In summary, the OA cultivated  extract showed the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro, enhanced reduction in  rotenone-induced toxicity, and produced less toxicity in zebrafish embryos  compared to the TA extract.},

Analysis was based on targeted detection of 41 pharmaceuticals, and non-targeted  analysis (suspect screening) of CECs. Biological effects of treated WWTP  effluents were assessed using a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) swimming behavior  assay. Concentrations of residues in surface waters were determined in grab  samples and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). In addition,  vitellogenin peptides, used as biomarkers of endocrine disruption, were  quantified using LC/MS/MS in the wild-caught fish plasma samples. Overall, 94  chemical residues were identified, including 63 pharmaceuticals, 10 industrial  chemicals, and 21 pesticides. Eight targeted pharmaceuticals were detected in  100\% of effluent samples with median detections of: bupropion (194 ng/L),  carbamazepine (91 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (190 ng/L), citalopram (172 ng/L),  desvenlafaxine (667 ng/L), iopamidol (3790 ng/L), primidone (86 ng/L), and  venlafaxine (231 ng/L). Over 30 chemical residues were detected in wild-caught  fish tissues. Notably, zebrafish larvae exposed to chemical extracts of effluents  from 9 of 10 WWTPs, in at least one season, were significantly hyperactive.  Vitellogenin expression in male or immature fish occurred 2.8 times more  frequently in fish collected from the Hudson River as compared to a reference  site receiving no direct effluent input. Due to the low concentrations of  pharmaceuticals detected in effluents, it is likely that chemicals other than  pharmaceuticals measured are responsible for the behavioral changes observed. The  combined use of POCIS and non-target analysis demonstrated significant increase  in the chemical coverage for CEC detection, providing a better insight on the  impacts of WWTP effluents and agricultural practices on surface water quality.},

Here, we used dechorionated Tropical 5D wild-type zebrafish  embryos to screen a 91-compound library provided by the National Toxicology  Program (NTP) for developmental toxicity. This library contained 86 unique  chemicals that included negative controls, flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs), drugs, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Fish were  exposed to 5 concentrations of each chemical or an equal amount of vehicle (0.5\%  DMSO) in embryo medium from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 5 days  post-fertilization (dpf). Fish were examined daily for mortality and teratogenic  effects and photomotor behavior was assessed at 4 and 5 dpf. Of the 5 negative  control compounds in the library, none caused mortality/teratogenesis, but two  altered behavior. Chemicals provided in duplicate produced similar outcomes.  Overall, 13 compounds caused mortality/teratology but not behavioral  abnormalities, 24 only affected behavior, and 18 altered both endpoints, with  behavior affected at concentrations that did not cause mortality/teratology  (55/86 hits). Of the compounds that affected behavior, 52\% caused behavioral  abnormalities at either 4 or 5 dpf. Compounds within the same functional group  caused different behavioral abnormalities, while similar behavioral patterns were  caused by compounds from different groups. Our data suggest that behavior is a  sensitive endpoint for developmental toxicity screening that integrates multiple  modes of toxic action and is influenced by the age of the larval fish at the time  of testing.},

	abstract = {In vertebrates, carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play important roles in ion transport and pH regulation in many organs, including the eyes, kidneys, central nervous  system, and inner ear. In aquatic organisms, the enzyme is inhibited by various  chemicals present in the environment, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and  pharmaceuticals. In this study, the effects of CA inhibitors, i.e., sulfonamides  [ethoxyzolamide (EZA), acetazolamide (AZA), and dorzolamide (DZA)], on zebrafish  embryogenesis were investigated. In embryos treated with the sulfonamides,  abnormal development, such as smaller otoliths, an enlarged heart, an irregular  pectoral fin, and aberrant swimming behavior, was observed. Especially, the  development of otoliths and locomotor activity was severely affected by all the  sulfonamides, and EZA was a consistently stronger inhibitor than AZA or DZA. In  the embryos treated with EZA, inner ear hair cells containing several CA  isoforms, which provide HCO(3)(-) to the endolymph for otolith calcification and  maintain an appropriate pH there, were affected. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide  staining indicated that the hair cell damage in the inner ear and pectral fin is  due to apoptosis. Moreover, RNA measurement demonstrated that altered gene  expression of cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-related proteins p53, p21, p27,  and Bcl-2 occurred even at 0.08 ppm with which normal development was observed.  This finding suggests that a low concentration of EZA may affect embryogenesis  via the apoptosis pathway. Thus, our findings demonstrated the importance of  potential risk assessment of CA inhibition, especially regarding the formation of  otoliths as a one of the most sensitive organs in embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {Early life exposure to environmental chemicals can have long-term consequences that are not always apparent until later in life. We recently demonstrated that  developmental exposure of zebrafish to low, nonembryotoxic levels of  3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) did not affect larval behavior, but  caused changes in adult behavior. The objective of this study was to investigate  the underlying molecular basis for adult behavioral phenotypes resulting from  early life exposure to PCB126. We exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 during  early development and measured transcriptional profiles in whole embryos, larvae  and adult male brains using RNA-sequencing. Early life exposure to 0.3 nM PCB126  induced cyp1a transcript levels in 2-dpf embryos, but not in 5-dpf larvae,  suggesting transient activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor with this treatment.  No significant induction of cyp1a was observed in the brains of adults exposed as  embryos to PCB126. However, a total of 2209 and 1628 genes were differentially  expressed in 0.3 and 1.2 nM PCB126-exposed groups, respectively. KEGG pathway  analyses of upregulated genes in the brain suggest enrichment of calcium  signaling, MAPK and notch signaling, and lysine degradation pathways. Calcium is  an important signaling molecule in the brain and altered calcium homeostasis  could affect neurobehavior. The downregulated genes in the brain were enriched  with oxidative phosphorylation and various metabolic pathways, suggesting that  the metabolic capacity of the brain is impaired. Overall, our results suggest  that PCB exposure during sensitive periods of early development alters normal  development of the brain by reprogramming gene expression patterns, which may  result in alterations in adult behavior.},

The emergence of bacterial resistance of  S. agalactiae to antibiotics leads to an urgent need of exploration of new  antimicrobial agents. In the study, the antibacterial activity of natural  component plumbagin (PLB) against S. agalactiae was investigated in vitro and in  vivo. The results showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PLB  against S. agalactiae was 8 mg/L. The growth curve assay revealed that PLB could  inhibit the growth of S. agalactiae. In addition, the time-killing curve showed  that S. agalactiae was killed almost completely by 2-fold MIC of PLB within 12 h.  Transmission electron microscopy results showed obvious severe morphological  destruction and abnormal cells of S. agalactiae after treated with PLB. The  pathogenicity of S. agalactiae to zebrafish was significantly decreased after  preincubation with PLB for 2 h in vitro, further indicating the bactericidal  activity of PLB. Interestingly, PLB could kill S. agalactiae without inducing  resistance development. Furthermore, pretreatment and post-treatment assays  suggested that PLB also exhibited the antibacterial activity against  S. agalactiae infection in vivo by effectively reducing the bacterial load and  improving the survival rate of S. agalactiae-infected zebrafish. In summary, PLB  had potent antibacterial activity against S. agalactiae in vitro and in vivo, and  it could be an excellent antimicrobial candidate to prevent and control  S. agalactiae infection.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish provide a valuable emerging complementary model for neurobehavioral research. They offer a powerful way to screen for the potential therapeutic  effects of neuroactive drugs. A variety of behavioral tests for zebrafish have  been developed and validated for assessing neurobehavioral function. The novel  tank diving test is a straightforward, reproducible way of measuring anxiety-like  behavior in zebrafish. When introduced into a novel tank, zebrafish normally dive  to the bottom of the tank and then gradually explore the higher levels of the  water column as time progresses. Buspirone is an effective anxiolytic drug in  humans, which has been found, with acute administration, to reduce this  anxiety-like response in zebrafish. The current study used the zebrafish model to  evaluate the potential anxiolytic effects of alkaloids, commonly found in  Solanaceae plants, with known neuropharmacology relevant to mood regulation. In  line with previous findings, acute treatment with anxiolytic positive controls  buspirone and the plant alkaloid nicotine reduced the anxiety-like diving  response in the zebrafish novel tank diving test. Further, both buspirone and  nicotine continued to produce anxiolytic-like effects in zebrafish after 5 days  of exposure. In the same treatment paradigm, the effects of five other  alkaloids-cotinine, anatabine, anabasine, harmane, and norharmane-were  investigated. Cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, also caused  anxiolytic-like effects, albeit at a dose higher than the effective dose of  nicotine. Nicotine's anxiolytic-like effect was not shared by the other nicotinic  alkaloids, anabasine and anatabine, or by the naturally present monoamine oxidase  inhibitors harmane and norharmane. We conclude that nicotine uniquely induces  anxiolytic-like effects after acute and subchronic treatment in zebrafish. The  zebrafish model with the novel tank diving test could be a useful complement to  rodent models for screening candidate compounds for anxiolytic effects in  nonclinical studies.},

Disinfection is one of the most important  steps, inactivating pathogens and preventing their regrowth during water  distribution. However, it is also involved in DBPs formation due to the use of  disinfectant agents, such as chlorine, which reacts with dissolved precursors,  such as pharmaceuticals, toxins, pesticides, among others. Given their widespread  occurrence, potential human health and (eco) toxicological impacts are of  particular interest due to their potential carcinogenicity and various  non-carcinogenic effects, such as endocrine disruption. In this study, the  developmental toxicity of chemically- different unregulated DBPs was evaluated  using zebrafish embryo bioassay. Embryos were exposed to different concentrations  of the target DBPs and multiple endpoints, including, mortality, morphological  abnormalities and locomotor behavior were assessed at specific developmental  stages (24, 48, 72 and 96 hpf). The different families of DBPs tested included  nitrosamines, aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. The results show that the effects  were compound dependent, with EC10 values varying between 0.04 mg/L  (2-ethyl-1-hexanal) to 9.2 mg/L (hexachloroacetone). Globally, several of the  tested unregulated DBPs displayed higher toxicity when compared with the  available data for some already regulated, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which  highlights the importance of screening the toxicity of still untested and poorly  characterized DBPs.},

	abstract = {Immunoglobulin Z (IgZ) or its equivalent immunoglobulin T (IgT) is a newly identified immunoglobulin (Ig) class from teleost fish. This Ig class is  characterized by its involvement in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs)  for mucosal defence against pathogen infection. Recently, several subclass  members of IgZ/IgT, such as IgZ, IgZ2, Igτ1, Igτ2 and Igτ3, have been further  identified from zebrafish, common carp and rainbow trout. However, the functional  diversity and correlation among these subclasses remain uncertain. Here, we  explored the differential immune reactions of the IgZ and IgZ2 subclasses in  antibacterial immunity in a zebrafish model. IgZ was extensively distributed in  the peripheral serum and skin/gill MALTs and showed a rapid induction upon  bacterial infection. IgZ2 was specialized in skin/gill MALTs and showed a strong  induction following IgZ production. Correspondingly, the IgZ(+) B cells had a  wider distribution in the systemic primary/secondary lymphoid tissues and MALTs  than the IgZ2(+) B cells, which were predominant in MALTs. IgZ and IgZ2 exhibited  a complementary effect in antibacterial immunity by possessing differential  abilities. That is, IgZ is preferentially involved in bactericidal reaction that  is in part C1q-dependent, and IgZ2 participates in neutralization action through  bacteria-coating activity. The production of IgZ largely depended on the αβ  T/CD4(+) T cells, whereas that of IgZ2 did not, suggesting the different  dependencies of IgZ and IgZ2 on systemic immunity. Our findings demonstrate that  the functional behaviour and mechanism of the IgZ/IgT family are more diverse  than previously recognized and thus improve the current knowledge about this  ancient Ig class.},

However, the  role of AurkB in differentiated and non-dividing cells has not been extensively  explored. Previously, we have described a significant upregulation of AurkB  expression in cultured cortical neurons following an experimental axonal  transection. This is somewhat surprising, as AurkB expression is generally  associated only with dividing cells Frangini et al. (Mol Cell 51:647-661, 2013);  Hegarat et al.

Herein,  we present the first description of a role for AurkB in terminally differentiated  neurons. AurkB was prominently expressed within post-mitotic neurons of the  zebrafish brain and spinal cord. The expression of AurkB varied during the  development of the zebrafish spinal motor neurons. Utilising pharmacological and  genetic manipulation to impair AurkB activity resulted in truncation and aberrant  motor axon morphology, while overexpression of AurkB resulted in extended axonal  outgrowth. Further pharmacological inhibition of AurkB activity in regenerating  axons delayed their recovery following UV laser-mediated injury. Collectively,  these results suggest a hitherto unreported role of AurkB in regulating neuronal  development and axonal outgrowth.},

Subsequently, a formulation characterization, bio-efficacy, and safety study of  EO-MRC were carried out. Expression of Anti-OBP2A and TRPV1 proteins on mosquito  head parts were studied by western blotting. In-silico screening was also  conducted for the specific proteins. An FT-IR study confirmed the chemical  compatibility of the EOs and excipients used in EO-MRC. The thermal behaviour of  the best EOs and their mixture was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis  (TGA). GC-MS examination revealed various chemical components present in EOs.  Efficacy of EO-MRC was correlated with 12\% N,N-diethyl benzamide (DEBA) based  marketed cream (DBMC). Complete protection time (CPT) of EO-MRC was determined as  228 min. Cytotoxicity study on L-132 cell line confirmed the non-toxic nature of  EO-MRC upon inhalation. Acute dermal irritation study, acute dermal dose toxicity  study, and acute eye irritation study revealed the non-toxic nature of EO-MRC.  Non-target toxicity study on Danio rerio confirmed EO-MRC as safer for aquatic  non-target animals. A decrease in the concentration of acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) was observed in transfluthrin (TNSF) exposed Wistar rats. While EO-MRC did  not alter the AChE concentrations in the exposed animals. Results from western  blotting confirmed that Anti-OBP2A and TRPV1 proteins were inhibited in TNSF  exposed mosquitoes. Mosquitoes exposed to EO-MRC showed a similar expression  pattern for Anti-OBP2A and TRPV1 as the control group. In silico study revealed  eight identified compounds of the EOs play significant roles in the overall  repellency property of the developed product. The study emphasizes the mosquito  repellent activity of EO-MRC, which could be an effective, eco-friendly, and  safer alternative to the existing synthetic repellents for personal protection  against mosquitoes during field conditions.},

However,  it may be possible to define a selected group of overarching mechanisms that  might allow detection of the vast majority of developmental toxicants. Against  this background, we have explored the usefulness of retinoic acid mediated  regulation of neural tube and axial patterning as a general mechanism that, when  perturbed, may result in manifestations of developmental toxicity that may cover  a large part of malformations known to occur in experimental animals and in man.  Through a literature survey, we have identified key genes in the regulation of  retinoic acid homeostasis, as well as marker genes of neural tube and axial  patterning, that may be used to detect developmental toxicants in in vitro  systems. A retinoic acid-neural tube/axial patterning adverse outcome pathway  (RA-NTA AOP) framework was designed. The framework was tested against existing  data of flusilazole exposure in the rat whole embryo culture, the zebrafish  embryotoxicity test, and the embryonic stem cell test. Flusilazole is known to  interact with retinoic acid homeostasis, and induced common and unique NTA marker  gene changes in the three test systems. Flusilazole-induced changes were similar  in directionality to gene expression responses after retinoic acid exposure. It  is suggested that the RA-NTA framework may provide a general tool to define  mechanistic pathways and biomarkers of developmental toxicity that may be used in  alternative in vitro assays for the detection of embryotoxic compounds.},

In this study,  we have found for the first time that SU5416 unexpectedly prevented  1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-induced neuronal apoptosis in cerebellar  granule neurons, and decreased 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine  (MPTP)-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and impairment of swimming behavior  in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner. However, VEGFR-2 kinase  inhibitor II, another specific VEGFR-2 inhibitor, failed to reverse neurotoxicity  at the concentration exhibiting anti-angiogenic activity, strongly suggesting  that the neuroprotective effect of SU5416 is independent from its anti-angiogenic  action. SU5416 potently reversed MPP(+)-increased intracellular nitric oxide  level with an efficacy similar to 7-nitroindazole, a specific neuronal nitric  oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor. Western blotting analysis showed that SU5416  reduced the elevation of nNOS protein expression induced by MPP(+). Furthermore,  SU5416 directly inhibited the enzyme activity of rat cerebellum nNOS with an  IC(50) value of 22.7 µM. In addition, knock-down of nNOS expression using short  hairpin RNA (shRNA) abolished the neuroprotective effects of SU5416 against  MPP(+)-induced neuronal loss. Our results strongly demonstrate that SU5416 might  exert its unexpected neuroprotective effects by concurrently reducing nNOS  protein expression and directly inhibiting nNOS enzyme activity. In view of the  capability of SU5416 to cross the blood-brain barrier and the safety for human  use, our findings further indicate that SU5416 might be a novel drug candidate  for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those associated with NO-mediated  neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemotherapeutic approaches involving microtubule-directed agents such as the vinca alkaloids and taxanes are used extensively and effectively in  clinical cancer therapy. There is abundant evidence of critical cytoskeletal  differences involving microfilaments between normal and neoplastic cells, and a  variety of natural products and semi-synthetic derivatives are available to  exploit these differences in vitro. In spite of the availability of such  potential anti-neoplastic agents, there has yet to be an effective  microfilament-directed agent approved for clinical use. Cytochalasins are  mycogenic toxins derived from a variety of fungal sources that have shown  promising in vitro efficacy in disrupting microfilaments and producing remarkable  cell enlargement and multi-nucleation in cancer cells without producing  enlargement and multi-nucleation in normal blood cells. Jasplakinolide is a  sponge toxin that stabilizes and rigidifies microfilaments. Insufficient in vivo  data has been acquired to determine whether any of the microfilament-directed  agents have valuable preferential anticancer activity in pre-clinical tumor model  systems. This is partly because the limited availability of these agents  precludes their initial use in large-scale mammalian pre-clinical studies.  Therefore, the present study sought to determine the tolerated in vivo doses of  cytochalasins and jasplakinolide in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a well-studied fish  cancer model that is 1.5\% the size of mice. We also determined the tolerated  levels of a variety of clinically active anti-neoplastic agents in zebrafish for  comparison with tolerated murine doses as a means to allow comparison of  toxicities in zebrafish expressed as μM concentrations with toxicities in mice  expressed in mg/kg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tolerated doses in zebrafish with  various cytochalasins or jasplakinolide were determined by adding the solubilized  test agent to water in which the fish were maintained for 24 h, then restored to  their normal tanks and monitored for a total of 96 h. RESULTS: Cytochalasin D at  0.2 μM gave an approximate LD50 in zebrafish, while cytochalasin B was  fully-tolerated at 5 μM, and gave an LD50 of 10 μM. 21,22-dihydrocytochalasin B  was fully-tolerated at 10 μM. Cytochalasin C was tolerated fully at 1 μM,  ten-fold higher than the level for cytochalasin D that was tolerated.  Jasplakinolide at 0.5 μM did not exhibit any apparent acute toxicity or affect  fish behavior for four days, but delayed toxicity was evident at days 4 and 6  when the fish died. Further, the addition of 5 μM glutathione (GSH) at the time  of treatment substantially decreased the toxicity of 10 μM cytochalasin B, a  level of cytochalasin B that not otherwise tolerated in vivo. Such observations  were likely due to GSH-mediated alkylation of C-20 in cytochalasin B, thereby  reducing the rate of oxidation to the highly toxic congener, cytochalasin A, and  reacting with any cytochalazin A formed. The protective effects of GSH are  further supported by its ability to react with α, β-unsaturated ketone moieties,  as is found in cytochalasin A. GSH at 0.8 uM was able to reduce the toxicity of  0.8 μM cytochalasin D, but it took 20 μM GSH to fully protect against the  toxicity of 0.8 μM cytochalasin D. CONCLUSION: Pre-clinical evaluation of rare  natural products such as microfilamented-directed agents for efficacy in vivo in  tumor-bearing zebrafish is a feasible prospect. Dose-limiting toxicities in  zebrafish expressed as μM concentrations in water can be used to estimate in vivo  toxicities in mice expressed as mg/kg.},

	abstract = {The external location of the zebrafish lateral line makes it a powerful model for studying mechanosensory hair cell regeneration. We have developed a chemical  screen to identify FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds that  modulate hair cell regeneration in zebrafish. Of the 1680 compounds evaluated, we  identified two enhancers and six inhibitors of regeneration. The two enhancers,  dexamethasone and prednisolone, are synthetic glucocorticoids that potentiated  hair cell numbers during regeneration and also induced hair cell addition in the  absence of damage. BrdU analysis confirmed that the extra hair cells arose from  mitotic activity. We found that dexamethasone and prednisolone, like other  glucocorticoids, suppress zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, indicating that hair  cell regeneration occurs by a distinctly different process. Further analyses of  the regeneration inhibitors revealed that two of the six, flubendazole and  topotecan, significantly suppress hair cell regeneration by preventing  proliferation of hair cell precursors. Flubendazole halted support cell division  in M-phase, possibly by interfering with normal microtubule activity. Topotecan,  a topoisomerase inhibitor, killed both hair cells and proliferating hair cell  precursors. A third inhibitor, fulvestrant, moderately delayed hair cell  regeneration by reducing support cell proliferation. Our observation that hair  cells do not regenerate when support cell proliferation is impeded confirms  previous observations that cell division is the primary route for hair cell  regeneration after neomycin treatment in zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Cationic polymethacrylates are interesting candidates for bacterial disinfectants since they can be made in large-scale by various well-established polymerization  techniques such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). However, they are  usually toxic or ineffective in serum and various strategies to improve their  biocompatibility or nonfouling property have often resulted in compromised  bactericidal activity. Also, star-shaped polymers are less explored than linear  polymers for application as antibacterial compounds. In this paper, star polymers  with poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDMA) as the arms and polyhedral  oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) as the core (POSS-g-PDMA) were successfully  synthesized by ATRP. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of the  synthesized POSS-g-PDMA are in the range of 10-20 μg/mL. POSS-g-PDMA was further  modified by various hydrophilization strategies in attempting to reduce  hemolysis. With quaternization of POSS-g-PDMA, the antibacterial activities of  the obtained quaternary polymers are almost unchanged and the copolymers become  relatively nonhemolytic. We also copolymerized sulfobetaine (SB) with POSS-g-PDMA  to obtain random and block PDMA-co-PSB arm structures, where the PDMA and  poly(sulfobetaine) were the cationic and zwitterionic blocks, respectively. The  random cationic-zwitterionic POSS-g-(PDMA-r-PSB) copolymers showed poor  antibacterial activity, while the block POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) copolymers retained  the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of the pristine POSS-g-PDMA. Further,  the block copolymers of POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) showed enhanced antifouling property  and serum stability as seen by their nanoparticle size stability in the presence  of serum and reduced red blood cell aggregation; the POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) also  somewhat retained its MIC in blood unlike the quaternized or random zwitterionic  copolymers. The antibacterial kinetics study showed that Escherichia coli can be  killed within 30 min by both random and block copolymers of POSS-g-(PDMA-co-PSB).  Finally, our POSS star polymers showed low toxicity to zebrafish embryo and could  be potentially used in aquaculture antibacterial applications.},

	abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including plasticizers, pesticides, detergents, and pharmaceuticals, affect a variety of hormone-regulated  physiological pathways in humans and wildlife. Many EDCs are lipophilic molecules  and bind to hydrophobic pockets in steroid receptors, such as the estrogen  receptor and androgen receptor, which are important in vertebrate reproduction  and development. Indeed, health effects attributed to EDCs include reproductive  dysfunction (e.g. reduced fertility, reproductive tract abnormalities, and skewed  male:female sex ratios in fish), early puberty, various cancers, and obesity. A  major concern is the effects of exposure to low concentrations of endocrine  disruptors in utero and post partum, which may increase the incidence of cancer  and diabetes in adults. EDCs affect transcription of hundreds and even thousands  of genes, which has created the need for new tools to monitor the global effects  of EDCs. The emergence of massive parallel sequencing for investigating gene  transcription provides a sensitive tool for monitoring the effects of EDCs on  humans and other vertebrates, as well as elucidating the mechanism of action of  EDCs. Zebrafish conserve many developmental pathways found in humans, which makes  zebrafish a valuable model system for studying EDCs, especially on early organ  development because their embryos are translucent. In this article, we review  recent advances in massive parallel sequencing approaches with a focus on  zebrafish. We make the case that zebrafish exposed to EDCs at different stages of  development can provide important insights on EDC effects on human health.},

For that, we coupled a  traditional toxicity approach (the zebrafish embryotoxicity test and dosage of  enzymatic biomarkers) to gel free proteomics analysis. At the concentration  tested, these proteins did not cause adverse effects in the zebrafish early life  stages, either by verifying phenotypic endpoints of toxicity or alterations in  representative enzymatic biomarkers (catalase, glutathione-S-tranferase and  lactate-dehydrogenase). At the molecular level, the Cry proteins tested lead to  very small changes in the proteome of zebrafish larvae. In a global way, these  proteins upregulated the expression of vitellogenins. Besides that, Cry1C e Cry1F  deregulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (Hnrnpa0l and Hnrnpaba,  respectively), implicated in mRNA processing and gene regulation. Overall, these  data lead to the conclusion that Cry1C, Cry1F and Cry1Ab proteins, even at a very  high concentration, have limited effects in the early stages of zebrafish life.},

Liver toxicity in zebrafish larvae at 5 days was assessed using gene  expression as the biomarker approach, complementary to phenotypic analysis and  analytical data on compound uptake. This approach aimed to contribute to improved  hepatotoxicity prediction, with the goal of identifying biomarker(s) as a step  towards the development of transgenic models for prioritization. Morphological  effects of hepatotoxic compounds (acetaminophen, amiodarone, coumarin,  methapyrilene and myclobutanil) and saccharin as the negative control were  assessed after exposure in zebrafish larvae. The hepatotoxic compounds induced  the expected zebrafish liver degeneration or changes in size, whereas saccharin  did not have any phenotypic adverse effect. Analytical methods based on liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry were optimized to measure stability of selected  compounds in exposure medium and internal concentration in larvae. All compounds  were stable, except amiodarone for which precipitation was observed. There was a  wide variation between the levels of compound in the zebrafish larvae with a  higher uptake of amiodarone, methapyrilene and myclobutanil. Detection of  hepatocyte markers (CP, CYP3A65, GC and TF) was accomplished by in situ  hybridization of larvae to coumarin and myclobutanil and confirmed by real-time  reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Experiments showed  decreased expression of all markers. Next, other liver-specific biomarkers (i.e.  FABP10a and NR1H4) and apoptosis (i.e. CASP-3 A and TP53) or cytochrome  P450-related (CYP2K19) and oxidoreductase activity-related (ZGC163022) genes,  were screened.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: SU4312, a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), has been designed to treat cancer. Recent studies have  suggested that SU4312 can also be useful in treating neurodegenerative disorders.  In this study, we assessed neuroprotection by SU4312 against  1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+) )-induced neurotoxicity and further  explored the underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: MPP(+) -treated  neurons and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated zebrafish  were used to study neuroprotection by SU4312. NOS activity was assayed in vitro  to examine direct interactions between SU4312 and NOS isoforms. KEY RESULTS:  SU4312 unexpectedly prevented MPP(+) -induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and  decreased MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, reduced expression of mRNA  for tyrosine hydroxylase and impaired swimming behaviour in zebrafish. In  contrast, PTK787/ZK222584, a well-studied VEGFR-2 inhibitor, failed to prevent  neurotoxicity, suggesting that the neuroprotective actions of SU4312 were  independent of its anti-angiogenic action. Furthermore, SU4312 exhibited  non-competitive inhibition of purified neuronal NOS (nNOS) with an IC(50) value  of 19.0 μM but showed little or no effects on inducible and endothelial NOS.  Molecular docking simulations suggested an interaction between SU4312 and the  haem group within the active centre of nNOS. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION: SU4312  exhibited neuroprotection against MPP(+) at least partly via selective and direct  inhibition of nNOS. Because SU4312 could reach the brain in rats, our study also  offered a support for further development of SU4312 to treat neurodegenerative  disorders, particularly those associated with NO-mediated neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Metastases largely rely on hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells via the vascular system and significantly limit prognosis of patients with solid tumors.  To colonize distant sites, circulating tumor cells must destabilize the  endothelial barrier and transmigrate across the vessel wall. Here we performed a  high-content screen to identify drugs that block tumor cell extravasation by  testing 3,520 compounds on a transendothelial invasion coculture assay. Hits were  further characterized and validated using a series of in vitro assays, a  zebrafish model enabling three-dimensional (3D) visualization of tumor cell  extravasation, and mouse models of lung metastasis. The initial screen advanced  38 compounds as potential hits, of which, four compounds enhanced endothelial  barrier stability while concurrently suppressing tumor cell motility. Two  compounds niclosamide and forskolin significantly reduced tumor cell  extravasation in zebrafish, and niclosamide drastically impaired metastasis in  mice. Because niclosamide had not previously been linked with effects on barrier  function, single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered mechanistic effects of the drug on  both tumor and endothelial cells. Importantly, niclosamide affected homotypic and  heterotypic signaling critical to intercellular junctions, cell-matrix  interactions, and cytoskeletal regulation. Proteomic analysis indicated that  niclosamide-treated mice also showed reduced levels of kininogen, the precursor  to the permeability mediator bradykinin. Our findings designate niclosamide as an  effective drug that restricts tumor cell extravasation through modulation of  signaling pathways, chemokines, and tumor-endothelial cell interactions.  SIGNIFICANCE: A high-content screen identified niclosamide as an effective drug  that restricts tumor cell extravasation by enhancing endothelial barrier  stability through modulation of molecular signaling, chemokines, and  tumor-endothelial cell interactions.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Human obesity is a complex metabolic disorder disproportionately affecting people of lower socioeconomic strata, and ethnic minorities, especially  African Americans and Hispanics. Although genetic predisposition and a positive  energy balance are implicated in obesity, these factors alone do not account for  the excess prevalence of obesity in lower socioeconomic populations. Therefore,  environmental factors, including exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and other  contaminants, are agents widely suspected to have obesogenic activity, and they  also are spatially correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Our study  investigates the causal relationship between exposure to the heavy metal, cadmium  (Cd), and obesity in a cohort of children and in a zebrafish model of  adipogenesis. DESIGN: An extensive collection of first trimester maternal blood  samples obtained as part of the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) was analyzed for  the presence of Cd, and these results were cross analyzed with the weight-gain  trajectory of the children through age 5 years. Next, the role of Cd as a  potential obesogen was analyzed in an in vivo zebrafish model. RESULTS: Our  analysis indicates that the presence of Cd in maternal blood during pregnancy is  associated with increased risk of juvenile obesity in the offspring, independent  of other variables, including lead (Pb) and smoking status. Our results are  recapitulated in a zebrafish model, in which exposure to Cd at levels  approximating those observed in the NEST study is associated with increased  adiposity. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify Cd as a potential human obesogen.  Moreover, these observations are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, suggesting  that the underlying mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved, and that  zebrafish may be a valuable model for uncovering pathways leading to Cd-mediated  obesity in human populations.},

Moreover the ultrafast (SO(2): {\textless}60 s; ClO(-):  within sec) and highly sensitive (detection limits: SO(2): 3.5 nM; ClO(-):  12.5 nM) detection were achieved. With the robust applicability, the developed  probe was successfully used to quantify SO(2) and endogenous ClO(-) in  respectively the HeLa cells and the RAW 264.7 cells, as well as to visualize the  dynamic of SO(2)/ClO(-) in zebrafish. The fluorescent imaging studies and flow  cytometry analysis confirmed the burst-and-depletion and meanwhile the  oxidative-and-antioxidative effects of intracellular SO(2) under the NaClO  induced oxidative stress.},

One such class of toxicants is the  ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Certain PAHs are known to  cause developmental cardiac toxicity in fish. Herein, we explored the role of GST  pi class 2 (GSTp2) in PAH- and PCB-induced cardiac toxicity in zebrafish (Danio  rerio) embryos. We measured expression of GSTp2 in embryos exposed to individual  and co-exposures of the PAHs benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP),  and fluoranthene (FL) as well as 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126). GSTp2  mRNA expression was induced by exposure to BkF, BaP, PCB-126, and BaP+FL and  BkF+FL co-exposure. A splice junction morpholino was then used to knockdown GSTp2  in developing zebrafish. GSTp2 knockdown exacerbated the toxicity caused by  co-exposures to BkF+FL and BaP+FL. However, GSTp2 knockdown did not affect  PCB-126 toxicity. These results further suggest that pi class GSTs serve a  protective function against the synergistic toxicity caused by PAHs in developing  zebrafish.},

The  objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of diallyl  trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfuric compound with most sulfur atoms found  in garlic, on migration and invasion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)  cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DATS were  further investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 cells and HS 578t breast  cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of DATS. DATS obviously  suppressed the migration and invasion of two cell lines and changed the  morphological. Moreover, DATS inhibited the mRNA/protein/ enzymes activities of  MMP2/9 via attenuating the NF-κB pathway. DATS also inhibited ERK/MAPK rather  than p38 and JNK. CONCLUSION: DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of  TNBC cells, and emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent. The inhibitory effects  are associated with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of NF-κB  and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways.},

Some  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can compromise the cardiovascular endothelial  function by activating oxidative stress-sensitive signaling pathways. Therefore,  we exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 or to several redox-modulating chemicals  to study their ability to modulate the dysmorphogenesis produced by PCB126.  PCB126 produced a concentration-dependent induction of pericardial edema and  circulatory failure, and a concentration-dependent reduction of cardiac output  and body length at 80 hours post fertilization (hpf). Among several modulators  tested, the effects of PCB126 could be both positively and negatively modulated  by different compounds; co-treatment with α-tocopherol (vitamin E liposoluble)  prevented the adverse effects of PCB126 in pericardial edema, whereas  co-treatment with sodium nitroprusside (a vasodilator compound) significantly  worsened PCB126 effects. Gene expression analysis showed an up-regulation of  cyp1a, hsp70, and gstp1, indicative of PCB126 interaction with the aryl  hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), while the transcription of antioxidant genes (sod1,  sod2; cat and gpx1a) was not affected. Further studies are necessary to  understand the role of oxidative stress in the developmental toxicity of low  concentrations of PCB126 (25 nM).

Zebrafish, a vertebrate  model increasingly used in neurobiology and neurotoxicology, shares the common  neurotransmitter systems with mammals, including glutamate, GABA, glycine,  dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine.  In this study, we have evaluated the performance of liquid chromatography-tandem  mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the multiresidue determination of  neurotransmitters and related metabolites. In a first step, ionization conditions  were tested in positive electrospray mode and optimum fragmentation patterns were  determined to optimize two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions.  Chromatographic conditions were optimized considering the chemical structure and  chromatographic behavior of the analyzed compounds. The best performance was  obtained with a Synergy Polar-RP column, which allowed the separation of the 38  compounds in 30 min. In addition, the performance of LC-MS/MS was studied in  terms of linearity, sensitivity, intra- and inter-day precision, and overall  robustness. The developed analytical method was able to quantify 27 of these  neurochemicals in zebrafish chemical models for mild (P1), moderate (P2), and  severe (P3) acute organophosphorus poisoning (OPP). The results show a general  depression of synaptic-related neurochemicals, including the excitatory and  inhibitory amino acids, as well as altered phospholipid metabolism, with specific  neurochemical profiles associated to the different grades of severity. These  results confirmed that the developed analytical method is a new tool for  neurotoxicology research using the zebrafish model.},

As a  result, D. rerio detected and avoided both pesticides at air temperatures of 20  and 24 °C; however, at 28 °C no significant difference was observed in habitat  choice by fish. Additionally, when pesticides were mixed in a heterogeneously  contaminated landscape, it was observed that D. rerio detected contamination and  preferred the clean zone at 20 and 24 °C; however, at 28 °C the potential to  escape from the most contaminated areas was impaired. Thus, contamination by both  pesticides made the habitat selection behavior of fish at 20 and 24 °C more  noticeable. In addition, the association between pesticides and temperature  showed negative effects on the response of fish to detect and escape from  contaminated environments, suggesting the influence of temperature in altering  the ability of the organism to provide an efficient response to stress.},

In this study, the main objective was to develop biocompatible copper  nanoparticles using chicken feather keratin protein (CuNPs-K) and to investigate  their impact on multidrug-resistant (MDR) uro-pathogens, E. coli and E. faecalis,  under both single and mixed culture conditions. CuNPs-K were characterised by  UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy, and docking experiments. The MIC values of  CuNPs-K against single and mixed planktonic cultures were 50 μg/ml and 75 μg/ml,  respectively. CuNPs-K efficiently disrupted the biofilm of single and mixed  uro-pathogen cultures by eliminating sessile cells. This biofilm disruption may  be attributed to a decline in the production of extracellular polymeric  substances in both single and mixed bacterial cultures treated with CuNPs-K.  Moreover, selective antimicrobial activity was determined by selectivity assays  using T24 cells. CuNPs-K targets both the bacterial membrane and DNA with  elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as their bactericidal mode of action. This  comprehensive antimicrobial activity of CuNPs-K was further confirmed in vivo by  using the zebra fish model. In this study, CuNPs-K effectively reduced bacterial  load with increased survivability of infected zebrafish. All these results  suggest that CuNPs-K can be explored as an exceptional antibacterial agent  against MDR uro-pathogenic E. coli and E. faecalis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive solid tumor malignancy of childhood. Although current treatment regimens cure approximately 70\% of patients with  localized disease, they are ineffective for most patients with metastases or  relapse. New treatment combinations are necessary for these patients.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on focal adhesion kinase  (FAK) for growth. To identify candidate treatment combinations for Ewing sarcoma,  we performed a small-molecule library screen to identify compounds synergistic  with FAK inhibitors in impairing Ewing cell growth. The activity of a top-scoring  class of compounds was then validated across multiple Ewing cell lines in vitro  and in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. RESULTS: Numerous Aurora  kinase inhibitors scored as synergistic with FAK inhibition in this screen. We  found that Aurora kinase B inhibitors were synergistic across a larger range of  concentrations than Aurora kinase A inhibitors when combined with FAK inhibitors  in multiple Ewing cell lines. The combination of AZD-1152, an Aurora kinase  B-selective inhibitor, and PF-562271 or VS-4718, FAK-selective inhibitors,  induced apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma cells at concentrations that had minimal  effects on survival when cells were treated with either drug alone. We also found  that the combination significantly impaired tumor progression in multiple  xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: FAK and Aurora kinase B  inhibitors synergistically impair Ewing sarcoma cell viability and significantly  inhibit tumor progression. This study provides preclinical support for the  consideration of a clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of this  combination for patients with Ewing sarcoma.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the neuroprotective effects of pinostrobin (PSB), a dietary bioflavonoid, and its underlying mechanisms in  neurotoxin-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) models. First, PSB could attenuate  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced loss of dopaminergic  neurons and improve behavior deficiency in zebrafish, supporting its potential  neuroprotective actions in vivo. Next, PSB could decreased apoptosis and death in  the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells, evidenced by  MTT, LDH, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and DNA fragmentation assay. PSB also blocked  MPP(+)-induced apoptotic cascades, including loss of mitochondrial membrane  potential, activation of caspase 3, and reduced ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition,  PSB suppressed MPP(+)-induced oxidative stress but increased antioxidant enzymes,  evidenced by decrease of reactive oxygen species generation and lipid  peroxidation and up-regulation of GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, GSH/GSSG, and NAD/NADH.  Further investigations showed that PSB significantly enhanced Nrf2 expression and  nuclear accumulation, improved ARE promoter activity and up-regulated expression  of HO-1 and GCLC. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown via specific Nrf2 siRNA abolished  PSB-induced antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects against MPP(+) insults.  Interestingly, we then found that PSB promoted phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and  ERK, and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/AKT or ERK signaling diminished  PSB-induced Nrf2/ARE activation and protective actions. In summary, PSB confers  neuroprotection against MPTP/MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity in PD models. Promoting  activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling contributes to PSB-mediated antioxidative and  neuroprotective actions, which, in part, is mediated by PI3K/AKT and ERK.},

The LC(50) values in  3-phenoxy benzoic acid (3-PBA) and endosulfan sulfate (ES) were 1461 μg/L and  1459 μg/L, respectively. At the concentration of 2000 μg/L, spine curvature was  observed in the ES-treated embryos. ES showed seizure-like events with an EC(50)  value of 354 μg/L. At the concentration of 1000 μg/L, the pericardial edema was  observed in 3-PBA-treated embryos. The inhibition of heart development and the  reduction of beating rates were observed in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) embryos after the  exposure to 3-PBA. Down-regulation of the vmhc gene coding ventricular myosin  during heart development was significantly found in 3-PBA-treated embryos at 48  hpf, but recovered afterward. It indicates that ventricular malformation occurred  at the initial stage of 3-PBA exposure.

	abstract = {In bacteria, the defense system deployed to counter oxidative stress is orchestrated by three transcriptional factors, SoxS, SoxR, and OxyR. Although the  regulon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are  not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative  stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the  corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing  (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a  knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and  mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to  elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly  regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and  denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes  specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators  were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant  was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration  against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity,  allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels,  was further evaluated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP(+)) accumulation assay.  The soxS mutant was also susceptible to tetracycline in vivo in a zebrafish  embryo model. We conclude that the soxS gene could be considered a genetic target  against which an inhibitor could be developed and used in combinatorial therapy  to combat infections associated with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.  IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is a global health challenge. Few new  antibiotics have been developed for use over the years, and preserving the  efficacy of existing compounds is an important step to protect public health.  This paper describes a study that examines the effects of exogenously induced  oxidative stress on K. pneumoniae and uncovers a target that could be useful to  harness as a strategy to mitigate resistance.},

Among the more intriguing and perhaps counterintuitive findings, at the current  state of the art, the connection between RNase activity and characterized host  defense functions is quite weak; whether this is a scientific reality or more a  reflection of what has been chosen for study remains to be determined. Several of  the RNase A family RNases are highly cationic and have cytotoxic and bactericidal  properties that are clearly (eosinophil cationic protein, leukocyte RNase A-2) or  are probably (RNase 7) unrelated to their enzymatic activity. Interestingly,  peptides derived from the leukocyte RNase A-2 sequence are nearly as bactericidal  as the entire protein, suggesting that among other functions, the RNase A  superfamily may be serving as a source of gene scaffolds for the generation of  novel cytotoxic peptides. Other RNase A ribonucleases are somewhat less cationic  (mouse angiogenin 4, zebrafish RNases) and have moderate bactericidal activities  that have not yet been explored mechanistically. Additional host defense  functions characterized specifically for the RNase eosinophil-derived neurotoxin  include reducing infectivity of RNA viruses for target cells in culture, which  does require RNase activity, chemoattraction of immature human dendritic cells  via a G-protein-coupled receptor-dependent mechanism, and activation of TLR2. The  properties of individual RNase A ribonucleases, recent experimental findings, and  important questions for the near and distant future will be reviewed.},

Glioma stem cells (GSCs) which considered as the potential target  of therapy for their crucial role in therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence,  are believed to be key factors for the disappointing outcome. Here, we took  advantage of GSCs as the cell model to perform high-throughput drug screening and  the old antibiotic, clofoctol, was identified as the most effective compound,  showing reduction of colony-formation and induction of apoptosis of GSCs.  Moreover, growth of tumors was inhibited obviously in vivo after clofoctol  treatment especially in primary patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and transgenic  xenografts. The anticancer mechanisms demonstrated by analyzing related  downstream genes and discovering the targeted binding protein revealed that  clofoctol exhibited the inhibition of GSCs by upregulation of Kruppel-like factor  13 (KLF13), a tumor suppressor gene, through clofoctol's targeted binding  protein, Upstream of N-ras (UNR). Collectively, these data demonstrated that  induction of KLF13 expression suppressed growth of gliomas and provided a  potential therapy for gliomas targeting GSCs.

Here, we report a two-component directed  self-assembly mode: the phytochemicals berberine and cinnamic acid can directly  self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) displaying good bacteriostastic activity.  Compared with several first-line antibiotics, the obtained nanostructures have a  better inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and stronger  ability for biofilm removal. These qualities are attributed to the fact that  organic assemblies can first spontaneously adhere to the surface of the bacteria,  infiltrate into the cell, and then lead to converging attack against MRSA;  thereafter, multipath bactericidal mechanisms of NPs on MRSA are found by both  transcriptomic analysis and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis.  Moreover, when combined with spectral data and single crystal X-ray diffraction,  the NPs' self-assembly mechanism governed by hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking  interactions is clearly elucidated. These non-covalent interactions induce the  NPs' formation of butterfly-like one-dimensional self-assembled units and finally  layered three-dimensional spatial configuration. In addition, biocompatibility  tests show that the NPs are nonhemolytic with little toxicity in vitro and in  vivo. This directed self-assembly mode can offer a new perspective toward the  design of biocompatible antimicrobial nanomedicines for clinical translation.},

	abstract = {Owing to the importance of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, many insecticides target the cholinergic system. Across phyla, cholinergic signaling is essential  for many neuro-developmental processes including axonal pathfinding and  synaptogenesis. Consequently, early-life exposure to such insecticides can  disturb these processes, resulting in an impaired nervous system. One test  frequently used to assess developmental neurotoxicity is the zebrafish light-dark  transition test, which measures larval locomotion as a response to light changes.  However, it is only poorly understood which structural alterations cause  insecticide-induced locomotion defects and how persistent these alterations are.  Therefore, this study aimed to link locomotion defects with effects on  neuromuscular structures, including motorneurons, synapses, and muscles, and to  investigate the longevity of the effects. The cholinergic insecticides diazinon  and dimethoate (organophosphates), methomyl and pirimicarb (carbamates), and  imidacloprid and thiacloprid (neonicotinoids) were used to induce hypoactivity.  Our analyses revealed that some insecticides did not alter any of the structures  assessed, while others affected axon branching (methomyl, imidacloprid) or muscle  integrity (methomyl, thiacloprid). The majority of effects, even structural, were  reversible within 24 to 72 h. Overall, we find that both neurodevelopmental and  non-neurodevelopmental effects of different longevity can account for the reduced  locomotion. These findings provide unprecedented insights into the underpinnings  of insecticide-induced hypoactivity.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of acute  exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in  zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We  observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching  delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of  malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included  cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days  post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head  length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and  5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the  ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects  were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in  larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled,  mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when  animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of  the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither  atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to  their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after  the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and  associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were  not altered. Our results highlight the need for further studies on the sublethal  effects of both herbicides and the consideration of the effects of commercial  formulas vs. isolated active ingredients.

The work provides a promising strategy with a low-cost and  simple procedure that could regulate pesticide release behavior, decrease  leaching loss, and improve the utilization efficiency of pesticide.},

We applied avoidance tests with Danio  rerio, exposing juveniles to three relevant current use pesticides: chlorpyrifos  (CPF), chlorothalonil (CTL) and glyphosate (Gly), individually and in binary  mixtures (CPF-Gly and CTL-Gly). Our goal was to identify the potential of  contaminants to trigger the avoidance response in fish and detect any changes to  that response resulting from binary mixtures. Avoidance was assessed for three  hours using an open gradient system with six levels of increasing concentrations.  Fish avoided environmentally relevant concentrations of the three compounds. The  avoidance of CPF [AC50 = 7.95 (3.3-36.3) µg/L] and CTL [AC50 = 3.41  (1.2-41.6) µg/L] was evident during the entire period of observation. In the case  of Gly, the response changed throughout the experiment: initially (until 100 min)  the fish tolerated higher concentrations of the herbicide [AC50 = 52.2  (12.1-2700) µg/L] while during the later period (after 100 min) a clearer  avoidance [1.5 (0.8-4.2) µg/L] was observed. The avoidance recorded using CPF and  CTL alone was attenuated by the presence of Gly. Applying an additive  concentration model, Gly initially acted synergistically with the other two  compounds, although this interaction was not observed during the later period.  Avoidance gives us an idea of how the distribution of populations may be altered  by contamination, our results suggest that in some mixtures this response may be  inhibited, at least temporarily, thus masking the ecological risk of the  exposure.},

	abstract = {Firemaster 550 (FM550) is a flame retardant (FR) mixture that has become one of the most commonly used FRs in household items such as foam-based furniture and  baby products. Because this mixture readily leaches from products, contamination  of the environment and human tissues is widespread. Prior work by us and others  has reported sex-specific behavioral deficits in rodents and zebrafish following  early life exposure. In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which these  behavioral effects occur, here we explored the effects of its constituents on  behavioral outcomes previously shown to be altered by developmental FM550  exposure. The FM550 commercial mixture is composed of two brominated compounds  (BFR) and two organophosphate compounds (OPFRs) at almost equivalent proportions.  Both the BFR and the OPFR components are differentially metabolized and  structurally distinct, but similar to known neurotoxicants. Here we examined  adult Wistar rat offspring socioemotional behaviors following perinatal exposure  (oral, to the dam) to vehicle, 2000 μg/day FM550, 1000 μg/day BFR or 1000 μg/day  OPFR from gestation day 0 to weaning. Beginning on postnatal day 65 offspring  from all groups were subjected to a series of behavioral tasks including open  field, elevated plus maze, marble burying, social interaction tests, and running  wheel. Effects were exposure-, sex- and task-specific, with BFR exposure  resulting in the most consistent behavioral deficits. Overall, exposed females  showed more deficits compared to males across all dose groups and tasks. These  findings help elucidate how different classes of flame retardants, independently  and as a mixture, contribute to sex-specific behavioral effects of exposure.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Although the etiology of PD is not completely understood, it is well-documented  that oxidative stress and Ca(2+)-mediated cellular damage play important roles in  the progression of PD.  2-[[(1,1-Dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a novel  nitrone derivative of tetramethylpyrazine, has shown significant therapeutic  effects in stroke models due to its multiple functions, including calcium  overload blockade and free radical-scavenging. In this study, we investigated the  neuroprotective and neurorescue effects of TBN on various in vitro and in vivo  models of PD and explored its possible mechanisms of action. The results show  that TBN exerted significant neuroprotection on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  (MPP(+))-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells and primary dopaminergic neurons, as  well as on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced  dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish (TBN and MPTP were added simultaneously  into the fish embryo medium and the treatment period was 48 h). In the  MPTP-induced mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat PD models, TBN  administrated orally twice daily for 14 d (3 d post-MPTP lesion in mice and 7 d  post-6-OHDA lesion in rats) exhibited remarkable neurorescue effects to increase  the number of dopaminergic neurons. In addition, TBN improved apomorphine-induced  rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-lesioned PD rats. TBN suppressed the  MPP(+)-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells,  increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH)  concentration in the substantial nigra of MPTP-treated mice. These data indicate  that TBN protects and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPP(+) and  MPTP/6-OHDA-induced damage by reducing ROS and increasing cellular antioxidative  defense capability.},

An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of sumithion on  embryological and larval development of zebrafish Danio rerio. Fertilized egg (n  = 100) and larvae (n = 100) were exposed to six concentrations of sumithion (0,  0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg L(-1)) in three replicates. LC(50) values for  embryos and larvae were calculated by probit analysis. The 24 h LC(50) value of  sumithion for embryo was 0.235 (0.079-0.428) mgL(-1). Increasing sumithion  concentrations decreased hatching success and increased embryonic mortality. In  embryos, sumithion induced several malformations including immature yolk sac,  dark yolk sac, yolk sac bud, broken eggshell and notochord, unhatched eggs.  Larval LC(50) values at 24, 48 and 72 h of various doses of sumithion exposure  were 0.620 (0.436-0.963), 0.475 (0.302-0.801) and 0.341 (0.177-0.617) mgL(-1),  respectively. Various physical deformities, including edema, notochord deformity,  yolk sac damage, body arcuation, lordosis and black pigmentation on the yolk sac  were evident in response to different concentrations of sumithion. The results of  the current study indicate that sumithion exerts developmental toxicity to  zebrafish embryos and larvae. It is expected that current findings will increase  sensitivity about the toxic effect of sumithion in early development, as well the  possibility of similar actions induced by other insecticides and pesticides.},

We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen  (Pestanal(®)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed  behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of  glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after  pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean  speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or  time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However,  there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen  concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to  control or vehicle. However, gr and crf gene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated  animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups. Taken  together, these findings indicate that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive  impairment and altered cortisol levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.},

While several studies report on mechanisms of toxicity of strobilurins  in fish, there are no data on the sub-lethal toxicity of fish to the fungicide  fenamidone. To address this gap, survival and hatch rate, deformities,  mitochondrial bioenergetics, expression of oxidative stress and apoptotic genes,  and behavior (locomotor activity and anxiolytic-related behaviors) were assessed  in zebrafish embryos and larvae following exposure to fenamidone. Fenamidone  negatively affected development of zebrafish embryos, causing a delay of hatching  time at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 μM. Fenamidone caused morphological  deformities in zebrafish, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail  deformities, and spinal curvature. Exposure to 1.5 μM fenamidone reduced surface  area of swim bladder in larvae at 6 dpf. Fenamidone significantly reduced oxygen  consumption rates of embryos; 5 μM fenamidone decreased basal respiration ({\textasciitilde}85\%),  oligomycin induced ATP-linked respiration ({\textasciitilde}70\%), FCCP-induced maximal  respiration ({\textasciitilde}75\%) and non-mitochondrial respiration ({\textasciitilde}90\%) compared to controls.  Sod2 mRNA levels were decreased by fenamidone in larval fish.

In this study we have  analyzed the suitability of the Vibrational Startle Response Assay (VSRA) to  obtain mechanistic information about the mode of action (MoA) of the chemicals  impairing the escape response and its habituation. As a proof of concept, the  pathophysiological mechanisms behind the action of two common neurotoxic  pesticides, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) and imidacloprid, over their effects on  arousal and habituation of the escape response were studied by using  pharmacological antagonists of the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine  receptors, mecamylamine (MCA) and scopolamine, respectively. Furthermore,  potential changes in the neurotransmitter profile were analyzed. Results revealed  that whereas the effect of CPO on arousal was mainly mediated by the activation  of nAChRs, its effect on habituation was mainly mediated by mAChRs. On the other  hand, imidacloprid only affected larvae arousal which was found to be mediated by  a cholinergic independent mechanism. No association between behavioral effects on  arousal or habituation in affected larvae was found with their corresponding  neurotransmitter profile. These results confirm the suitability of VSRA to  provide mechanistic information about the potential MoA of neuroactive compounds.},

These toxicants are neuro- and organotoxic to  mammals at low concentrations, thus early detection of these chemicals in the  aqueous environment is of utmost importance. Here, we employed the behavioral  toxicity test with wildtype zebrafish larvae to determine sublethal  concentrations of the above mentioned common environmental pollutants. After  optimizing the test with cyanide, nine rodenticides and an organophosphate were  successfully tested. The compounds dose-dependently initially (0-60-min exposure)  stimulated locomotor activity of larvae but induced toxicity and reduced swimming  during 60-120-min exposure. IC(50) values calculated based on swimming distance  after 2-h exposure, were between 0.1 and 10 mg/L for both first-generation and  second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. Three behavioral characteristics,  including total distance travelled, sinuosity and burst count, were  quantitatively analyzed and compared by hierarchical clustering of the effects  measured by each three parameters. The toxicity results for all three behavioral  endpoints were consistent, suggesting that the directly measured parameter of  cumulative swimming distance could be used as a promising biomarker for the  aquatic contamination. The optimized method herein showed the potential for  utilization as part of a monitoring system and an ideal tool for the risk  assessment of drinking water in the military and public safety.},

	abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole pesticide that is used in both residential and agricultural applications. Fipronil is detected in run-off and water systems that  are near areas in which the pesticide has been applied. The pesticide acts to  antagonize gamma aminobutyric acid receptors, leading to over-excitation in the  central nervous system. Fipronil has relatively high toxicity to fish, but the  mechanisms underlying the toxicity are not well understood in embryonic stages.  Zebrafish embryos were exposed to a single concentration of fipronil for 48 h at  ∼3-4 h-post-fertilization. Following a 7-day depuration phase, transcriptome and  behavioral analyses were conducted. Transcriptomics identified neural processes  as those differentially expressed with different doses of fipronil (0.2 µg,  200 µg and 2 mg fipronil/L). Gene networks associated with astrocyte  differentiation, myelination, neural tube development, brain stem response,  innervation, nerve regeneration, astrocyte differentiation, among other pathways  were altered with exposure. In addition, miRNA-related events are disrupted by  fipronil exposure and genes associated with primary or pri-miRNA processing were  increased in larval fish exposed to the pesticide. These data present putative  mechanisms associated with neurological impacts at later ages of zebrafish. This  is important because it is not clear how early exposure to pesticides like  fipronil affect central nervous system function and organisms later in life.},

Cisplatin (CP) and aminoglycosides are  effective antineoplastic or bactericidal drugs, and their application has a high  probability of ototoxicity which results from the death of hair cells (HCs).  Here, we describe the therapeutic effect of the flavonoid compound naringin (Nar)  against ototoxic effects of cisplatin and aminoglycosides include gentamicin (GM)  and neomycin (Neo) in zebrafish HCs. Animals incubated with Nar (100-400 μmol/L)  were protected against the pernicious effects of CP (150-250 μmol/L), GM  (50-150 μmol/L) and Neo (50-150 μmol/L). We also provide evidence for the  potential mechanism of Nar against ototoxicity, including antioxidation,  anti-apoptosis, promoting proliferation and hair cell regeneration. We found that  mRNA levels of the apoptotic- and pyroptosis-related genes are regulated by Nar  both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, by proving that Nar does not affect the  anti-tumour efficacy of CP and antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides in  vitro, we highlight its value in clinical application. In conclusion, these  results unravel a novel therapeutic role for Nar as an otoprotective drug against  the adverse effects of CP and aminoglycosides.},

	abstract = {Glyphosate levels and the transfer of glyphosate across trophic levels have rarely been studied in zooplankton. The food preferences of zebrafish during the  first-feeding stage (which is critical for the survival of organisms), were  analyzed because of the requirement for live food. Larval survival begins to be  affected when glyphosate intake exceeds 0.3666 µg/larvae/day, in the case that  only the food is contaminated; if the medium is also contaminated, the effects on  survival start from 0.2456 µg/larvae/day. It was shown that glyphosate was more  likely to be incorporated through the medium than through the food (zooplankton),  which supports the results of previous studies that have ruled out the potential  for biomagnification. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of glyphosate was  determined using an ELISA tests specific to measure glyphosate in the fish D.  rerio, the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Lecane papuana, and the  cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. The experimental design consisted in exposing  seven zebrafish adults per replica (four replicates) in three treatments 1, 5,  and 10 mg/L of glyphosate for 96 h to obtain bioconcentration factors in the  gills, liver, and muscle. These concentrations were selected as potential  glyphosate concentrations right after application as double highest reported  concentration. Glyphosate levels in zooplankton can represent up to 6.26\% of the  total weight of rotifers (BFC = 60.35) and in zebrafish adult organs were less  than 8 µg/mg of tissue (BCF values {\textless} 6). Although glyphosate does not biomagnify,  our results suggest that glyphosate affected the dynamics between zooplankton and  zebrafish larvae, diminishing survival and feeding rates, given that zooplankton  species bioconcentrate glyphosate in large quantities. The BCF values found in  this contribution are higher than expected. Glyphosate exposure affected energy  metabolism and feeding behavior of zebrafish larvae, which presented high  mortality rates at environmentally relevant concentrations.},

C) from children's  supplements after 14 days chronic exposure to insecticide mixture fipronil (Fip)  + pyriproxyfen (Pyr) on juvenile zebrafish for swimming performances, social  behavior and oxidative stress associated with ASD model. Juvenile (14-17 mm)  wild-type AB zebrafish (Danio rerio) (45 days) were exposed to relevant  concentrations: vit. C (25 µg L(-1)), Fip (600 µg L(-1)/1.372 μM) + Pyr (600 µg  L(-1)/1.89 μM), and [Fip (600 µg L(-1)/1.372 μM) + Pyr (600 µg L(-1) /1.89 μM)] +  vit. C (25 µg L(-1)). Our results showed that insecticides can disturb the social  behavior of zebrafish during 14 days of the administration, decreased the  swimming performances, and elevated the oxidative stress biomarkers of SOD  (superoxide dismutase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and MDA (malondialdehyde).  The vitamin C supplement significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity of  insecticide mixture and oxidative stress. This study provides possible in vivo  evidence to show that vitamin C supplements could attenuate oxidative stress and  brain damage of fipronil and pyriproxyfen insecticide chronic exposure on  zebrafish juvenile.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rotenone (ROT) is currently being used in various research fields, especially neuroscience. Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a  Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical  spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses  through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria.  Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the  present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination  with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive  behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 µg/L, valproic acid (VPA)-0.5  mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics  (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests  and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. RESULTS: We  observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a)  CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views,  this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal  intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p \&lt; 0.05). Four out of  eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA-displayed  an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on  distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p \&lt; 0.05, 0.005, and  0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT +  PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the  above groups (p \&gt; 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a  normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental  groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p \&lt; 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001)  not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p \&lt; 0.05, 0.005, and  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement  compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e-h).  Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing  day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a  specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.},

The present  study focus on the evaluation of the mosquito larvicidal efficacy of metabolites  of seven indigenous fungal isolates (Penicillium sp. Aspergillus niger, A.  flavus, A. parasiticus, Rhizopus sp. Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp.) on the larvae  of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus under the laboratory condition. The  preliminary screening of the isolate, Penicillium sp. showed better larvicidal  effect when compared to other fungi. The fungus was grown on Potato Dextrose  Broth (PDB) in the laboratory (at 25°C) and maintained in the relative humidity  (at 76 ± 4\% for 15 days). Larvicidal potency of mycelial ethyl acetate extract  (MEAE) of Penicillium sp. was performed against 1st to 4th instars larvae of Ae.  aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus using four different concentrations (100, 200,  300, and 500 μg/ml) that showed better larval mortality values (μg/ml) of LC(50)  = 6.554, 5.487, 6.874, 6.892, and the LC(90) = 11.486, 10.366, 12.879, 13.865 for  Ae. aegypti and LC(50) = 7.000, 13.943, 18.129, 25.212 and the LC(90) = 12.541,  23.761, 30.923, 41.696 for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Exposure of metabolite to larvae  resulted in behavior changes i.e., excitation, up and down with aggressive  movement, anal papillae biting behavior. Further, the larvae treated with  Penicillium sp. metabolite exhibited significant reduction in the levels of  acetylcholinesterase. The 4th instar mosquito larvae treated with the 500 μg/ml  mycelia extract showed severe histological damages. During the antibacterial  analysis of Penicillium sp.- mycelium the maximum growth inhibition zone was  recorded in Shigella dysenteriae (31.2 mm) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.1 mm)  followed by others. In addition, to check the toxicity of Penicillium sp. MEAE  against embryos of Zebrafish, a model system, using different concentrations of  metabolites (1.0, 0.5, 0.125 mg/ml, 30, 3.0, and 0.5 μg/ml) and life-stage  parameters were observed at 124 hpf. Furthermore, the Fourier Transformed  Infrared and GCMS spectrum analysis of mycelium reflected several chemical  compounds. The outcome of the study clearly shows that Penicillium sp.  metabolites could serve as an ideal eco-friendly, single-step and inexpensive  source for the control of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae.},

Previously, our lab has shown that  model eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and  Danio rerio all retain high viability after prolonged arrest in a state of  anoxia-induced suspended animation, implying that in such a state, progression  through the cell division cycle is reversibly arrested in an orderly manner.  Here, we show that S. cerevisiae (both wild-type and several cold-sensitive  strains) and C. elegans embryos exhibit a dramatic decrease in viability that is  associated with dysregulation of the cell cycle when exposed to low temperatures.  Further, we find that when the yeast or worms are first transitioned into a state  of anoxia-induced suspended animation before cold exposure, the associated  cold-induced viability defects are largely abrogated. We present evidence that by  imposing an anoxia-induced reversible arrest of the cell cycle, the cells are  prevented from engaging in aberrant cell cycle events in the cold, thus allowing  the organisms to avoid the lethality that would have occurred in a cold,  oxygenated environment.},

Overuse of isoprocarb always leaves toxic residues in soil and water, however,  the potential ecotoxicity of isoprocarb to organisms is still confusing. In this  study, zebrafish embryo was used as a model to evaluate the toxicity of  isoprocarb. Zebrafish embryos (96 hpf) were separately exposed at different  concentrations of isoprocarb. The mortality rate, hatchability rate, average  heart beat of the zebrafish embryo were separately calculated. Our results  suggested that exposure to isoprocarb induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish  embryos. HE staining showed that exposure to isoprocarb caused developmental  defect in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos. As expected, the behavioral  analysis also showed that the motor ability of zebrafish embryos were  significantly inhibited following exposure to isoprocarb. In terms of mechanism,  The expressions of genes involved in neurodevelopment signaling pathways, such as  foxo3a, gfap, syn2a, elavl3 and sox19b, were inhibited in zebrafish embryos after  exposure to isoprocarb. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also reduced  in isoprocarb-treated zebrafish embryos. Moreover, oxidative stress was induced  by increasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and decreasing the activity  of antioxidant enzyme (SOD) after exposure to isoprocarb. Expectedly, acridine  orange (AO) staining and the detection of some apoptosis-related genes revealed  that oxidative stress resulted in apoptosis. In short, the expressions of genes  associated with the neurodevelopmental signaling pathway are inhibited, and  oxidative stress is also induced in zebrafish embryos after exposure to  isoprocarb, which may be the molecular basics of isoprocarb-induced neurotoxicity  in zebrafish embryos.},

As a side effect, however, these insecticides contaminate bodies of  water, resulting in damage to aquatic organisms. The development of  nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the control of agricultural  pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing their toxicological effects. Based  upon this, the present study has investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate  chitosan nanoparticles (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on  non-target organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM,  as well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity was also  evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT (NP + DMT), and  commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and larvae of Danio rerio  (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology, and behavior. The nanoparticle  control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size values of 283 ± 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 ± 0.05  and a zeta potential of -31 ± 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate,  the nanoparticles showed 301 ± 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 ± 0.02, a zeta  potential of -27.9 ± 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 ± 0.32\%, with  slow-release overtime (52\% after 48 h). The AFM images showed that both types of  nanoparticles showed spherical morphology. Major toxic effects on embryo larval  development were observed in commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the  technical pesticide, predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With  regard to the toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an  increase for LC(50)-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior of the  larvae was not affected. The data obtained demonstrate that nanoencapsulated  dimethoate reduces the toxicity of insecticides on zebrafish larvae, suggesting  that nanoencapsulation may be safer for non-target species, by eliminating  collateral effects and thus promoting sustainable agriculture.},

We found  that propoxur exposure delays embryonic development, resulting in three distinct  developmental stages: no delay, mild delay, or severe delay. Interestingly, the  delayed embryos all physically recovered 5 days after exposure, but behavioral  analysis revealed persistent cognitive deficits at later stages. Microarray  analysis identified 59 genes significantly changed by propoxur treatment, and  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that these genes are involved in cancer,  organismal abnormalities, neurological disease, and hematological system  development. We further examined hspb9 and hspb11 due to their potential roles in  zebrafish development and found that propoxur increases expression of these small  heat shock proteins in all of the exposed animals. However, we discovered that  less significant increases were associated with the more severely delayed  phenotype. This raises the possibility that a decreased ability to upregulate  these small heat shock proteins in response to propoxur exposure may cause  embryos to be more severely delayed.},

This may pose a  threat to the health of aquatic animals. To explore the ATZ-induced hepatic  metabolism disorder, male zebrafish were exposed to 300 and 1000 μg/L ATZ for 21  days, respectively. The results revealed that ATZ exposure significantly reduced  hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels, while significantly (p \&lt; 0.05) increased  pyruvate (PYR) and total cholesterol (TC) levels. In addition, the liver sample  from the 1000 μg/L ATZ-treated group was used for GC/MS metabolomic analysis. The  principal component analysis (PCA) model showed significant separation of the  1000 μg/L ATZ group from the control group, indicating that ATZ exposure altered  hepatic metabolism in male adult zebrafish. A total of 29 significantly (p \&lt;  0.05) different metabolites were observed and identified in the ATZ-treated  group. Moreover, the most disturbed pathways by ATZ were the arginine and proline  metabolic pathways, followed by the glutathione metabolic pathway. Three and two  metabolites were significantly altered in the arginine and proline metabolic  pathways and glutathione metabolic pathway, respectively. Based on these results,  we suggested that ATZ was capable of altering liver metabolism in zebrafish and  that its ecological risk to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored.},

Water played a key role in the fate of methoxyfenozide,  acting as a sink in the simulated aquatic environment, followed by sediment. Only  approximately 2\% of methoxyfenozide entered the organisms (zebrafish and Egeria  densa Planch). Methoxyfenozide underwent a significant transport process between  the water and sediment.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate  the enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior and toxic effects of penthiopyrad  in zebrafish. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed when  exposed to penthiopyrad at two dose levels: S-(+)-penthiopyrad was preferentially  accumulated. Moreover, S-(+)-penthiopyrad caused oxidative stress in zebrafish  liver. The results of real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that exposure to  penthiopyrad also enantioselectivity interfered with the expression of  mitochondrial respiratory complexes, mtDNA synthesis, lipid metabolism and  apoptosis-related genes. S-(+)-penthiopyrad significantly decreased most of the  expression of the above gene, which showed higher toxic effects. We inferred that  the toxicity mechanism of penthiopyrad was caused by lipid metabolism disorder  and mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish, and further leads to apoptosis even  DNA damage.

These samples have a similar polymer  composition with mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). However, these  two samples are very dissimilar with regard to their contamination profile and  their toxicity. MPs from MG contain more lead, cadmium and organochlorine  compounds while those from PB have higher levels of copper, zinc and  hydrocarbons. The leachates of these two samples of MPs induced sublethal effects  on the growth of sea urchins and on the pulsation frequency of jellyfish ephyrae  but not on the development of zebrafish embryos. The toxic effects are much more  marked for samples from the PB site than those from the MG site.

Recent reviews have summarized the currently  available zebrafish models of Parkinson's Disease, which include gene-based,  chemically induced and chemogenetic ablation models. The present review updates  the literature, critically evaluates each of the available models of Parkinson's  Disease in zebrafish and compares them with similar models in invertebrates and  mammals to determine their advantages and disadvantages. We examine gene-based  models, including ones linked to Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease: PARKIN, PINK1,  DJ-1, and SNCA; but we also examine LRRK2, which is linked to Late-Onset  Parkinson's Disease. We evaluate chemically induced models like MPTP, 6-OHDA,  rotenone and paraquat, as well as chemogenetic ablation models like  metronidazole-nitroreductase. The article also reviews the unique advantages of  zebrafish, including the abundance of behavioural assays available to researchers  and the efficiency of high-throughput screens. This offers a rare opportunity for  assessing the potential therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological interventions.  Zebrafish also are very amenable to genetic manipulation using a wide variety of  techniques, which can be combined with an array of advanced microscopic imaging  methods to enable in vivo visualization of cells and tissue. Taken together,  these factors place zebrafish on the forefront of research as a versatile model  for investigating disease states. The end goal of this review is to determine the  benefits of using zebrafish in comparison to utilising other animals and to  consider the limitations of zebrafish for investigating human disease.},

Following the determination of the 96 h-LC(50),  exposure to sublethal concentrations showed the safety profile of both E. arvense  and M. tenuiflora. However, following 96-h exposure to Thymol, increased  lethality, pericardial oedema, yolk and eye deformations, and decreased body  length were observed. The reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratio was  increased, and the glutathione-s-transferase activity in the group exposed to the  highest Thymol concentration. Overall, these results support a more reducing  environment associated with possible effects at the cellular proliferation level.  In addition, the disruption of behavioural states (fear- and anxiety-like  disorders) were noted, pointing to alterations in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase  developmental signalling pathway, although further studies are required to  explore this rationale.

Results indicated that 1.69 mg·L(-1) diquat  exposure caused cellular vacuolisation and degeneration with nuclear abnormality  and led to the disturbance of antioxidative system and dysfunction in the liver.  No evident pathological injury was detected, and changes in liver biochemistry  were not obvious in the fish exposed to 0.34 mg·L(-1) diquat. Multivariate  statistical analysis revealed differences between profiles obtained by GC-MS  spectrometry from control and two treatment groups. A total of 17 and 22  metabolites belonging to different classes were identified following exposure to  0.34 and 1.69 mg·L(-1) diquat, respectively. The metabolic changes in the liver  of zebrafish are mainly manifested as inhibition of energy metabolism, disorders  of amino acid metabolism and reduction of antioxidant capacity caused by  1.69 mg·L(-1) diquat exposure. The energy metabolism of zebrafish exposed to  0.34 mg·L(-1) diquat was more inclined to rely on anaerobic glycolysis than that  of normal zebrafish, and interference effects on lipid metabolism were observed.

It is recognized as a new type of environmental  endocrine disruptor with frequent detection and environmental pollution. However,  the toxicity mechanism regarding neurodevelopment and neurobehavior remains  unclear. This study is intended to explore the underlying toxic mechanism of TCS  based on gut-brain axis. TCS-chronic exposure affected the development of  zebrafish, induced feminization, obesity physical signs and abnormal organ index  and caused neurobehavioral abnormalities by inhibiting both neurotransmitter  acetylcholinesterase and dopamine activity, promoting brain neuron apoptosis and  accelerating diencephalic lesions. Meanwhile, TCS-chronic exposure led to gut  microbiota dysbiosis and decreased diversity, such as increased pathogenic  bacteria and decreased probiotics in adult zebrafish gut, which caused many  pathological damages, including partial shedding and ablation of intestinal  villi, inflammatory infiltration, thinning of intestinal wall, and increased  goblet cell in villus. Based on the communication between intestinal peripheral  nerves and CNS, the above histopathological injuries and disorders were well  underpinned and illustrated by the changes of biomarkers and the expression of  related marker genes in the gut-brain axis. Additionally, short-chain fatty acids  (SCFA), as the regulators of intestinal sympathetic nerve activation, are also  secreting products of intestinal microflora and play a crucial role in regulating  the balance of intestinal flora and protecting intestinal homeostasis. SCFA in  low doses can effectively alleviate and rescue the toxic effects under TCS  exposure, which evidenced that TCS exerted systemic toxic effects on the  gut-brain axis by influencing the composition and diversity of gut flora in  zebrafish, and fully demonstrated the interaction effect between intestine and  brain. Hence, these findings contribute to the understanding, prevention, and  diagnosis of endocrine disrupting diseases caused by environmental pollutants  from the perspective of the gut-brain axis, and strengthening the early warning,  management and control of TCS pollution.},

Turbot and other flatfish are used to characterize the  presence of chemicals in the marine environment. Unfortunately, there are  relatively few genes of turbot and other flatfish in GenBank, which limits the  use of molecular tools such as microarrays and quantitative reverse-transcriptase  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to study disruption of endocrine responses in  sentinel fish captured by regulatory agencies. OBJECTIVES: We fabricated a  multigene cross-species microarray as a diagnostic tool to screen the effects of  environmental chemicals in fish, for which there is minimal genomic information.  The array included genes that are involved in the actions of adrenal and sex  steroids, thyroid hormone, and xenobiotic responses. This microarray will provide  a sensitive tool for screening for the presence of chemicals with adverse effects  on endocrine responses in coastal fish species. METHODS: We used a custom  multispecies microarray to study gene expression in wild hornyhead turbot  (Pleuronichthys verticalis) collected from polluted and clean coastal waters and  in laboratory male zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to estradiol and  4-nonylphenol. We measured gene-specific expression in turbot liver by qRT-PCR  and correlated it to microarray data. RESULTS: Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses of  livers from turbot collected from polluted areas revealed altered gene expression  profiles compared with those from nonaffected areas. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement  between the array data and qRT-PCR analyses validates this multispecies  microarray. The microarray measurement of gene expression in zebrafish, which are  phylogenetically distant from turbot, indicates that this multispecies microarray  will be useful for measuring endocrine responses in other fish.},

	abstract = {Wastewater recovered from hydraulic fracturing is referred to as flowback and produced water (FPW), and is often saline, contains numerous organic and  inorganic constituents, and may pose threats to groundwater resources. Hundreds  of spills of FPW have been reported to the Alberta Energy Regulator each year.  Recently, samples of FPW derived from hydraulic fracturing of the Duvernay  Formation, AB, were found to contain a previously unidentified class of aryl  phosphates, including diphenyl phosphate (DPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and  others. Aryl phosphates are also used in a variety of other industries and their  constituents can be found in flame retardants, plasticizers, lubricants,  hydraulic fluids, and oxidizers. Many of these aryl phosphates break down into  DPP. Therefore, it is important to determine the environmental fate and potential  impact of DPP if spilled in the near-surface, as DPP is an emerging contaminant  in soil and groundwater systems. This study was aimed at determining 1) the  sorption behavior of DPP onto various surficial sediments collected within the  Fox Creek, AB region, and 2) the toxicity of DPP toward aquatic ecosystems. We  report that the sorption of DPP onto both clay-rich soils and sandy sediment was  low compared to that of other aryl phosphates, with an average log K(OC) value of  2.30 ± 0.42 (1σ). Therefore, the transport of DPP in groundwater would be rapid  due to its low degree of sorption on surficial materials. We also determined the  acute 96 h-LC(50) of DPP on zebrafish embryos to be 50.0 ± 7.1 mg/L. Su et al.  (2014) studied the toxic effects of DPP and TPP on chicken embryonic hepatocytes  and found that DPP had less cytotoxic effects than TPP but altered more gene  transcripts. From the results our study, we infer that DPP may pose an  environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems if released into the environment.},

	abstract = {The herbicide acetochlor is used in most parts of the world and is frequently detected in agricultural land and surface water; however, knowledge on the  neurotoxicity of acetochlor is limited. Here, to test the effects of acetochlor  on zebrafish development and behaviour, zebrafish embryos were exposed to  acetochlor from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf, and larvae at 6 days  post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to acetochlor for 24 h. Both were exposed  to 5, 10, or 20 mg/L acetochlor. We found that acetochlor induced developmental  abnormalities, locomotion variations and changes in the physiology and gene  expression in the embryos and larvae. The abnormalities included spinal  curvature, brain abnormalities, and the decreased formation of newborn neurons.  Larval locomotion was decreased with increases in the absolute turn angle and  sinuosity. Acetylcholinesterase activity reduced in both embryos and larvae, and  the expression of genes that are involved in neurodevelopment and the  neurotransmitter system altered. Acetochlor increased the production of ROS and  the accumulation of MDA but decreased CAT activity in the embryonic brain.  Additionally, acetochlor induced cell death in the brain and tail spinal cord,  and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl2 and caspase 3 were  significantly upregulated. Collectively, this is the first study to examine the  molecular and physiological effects of acetochlor on neuronal development, and  the potential mechanisms appear to be associated with oxidative stress and  decreased AChE activity, which disrupt the expression of nervous system genes and  apoptosis-related genes and finally lead to apoptosis and morphological  malformations.},

METHODS: We searched multiple  comprehensive databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library) for studies  published until August 2020. Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were used  for the pooled estimates. Efficacy outcomes included ischemic stroke (IS),  stroke/systemic embolism (SSE), myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause  mortality, and safety outcomes included major bleeding, gastrointestinal (GI)  bleeding, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The P score was calculated for  ranking probabilities. Subgroup analyses were separately performed in accordance  with the dosage range of NOACs ("standard-" and "low-dose"). RESULTS: A total of  11, 6, and 8 studies were allocated to the total population, standard-dose group,  and low-dose group, respectively. In the total study population, edoxaban ranked  the best in terms of IS and ICH prevention and apixaban ranked the best for SSE,  major bleeding, and GI bleeding. In the standard-dose regimen, apixaban ranked  the best in terms of IS and SSE prevention. For major bleeding, GI bleeding, and  ICH, edoxaban ranked the best. In the low-dose regimen, edoxaban ranked the best  for IS, SSE, GI bleeding, and ICH prevention. For major bleeding prevention,  apixaban ranked best. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 NOACs had different efficacy and safety  outcomes according to their type and dosage. Apixaban and edoxaban might be  relatively better and more well-balanced treatment for Asian patients with  non-valvular atrial fibrillation.},

Although optimized  amount of boron supplement has been shown to be essential for normal gestational  development in zebrafish and frog and beneficial for bone regeneration in higher  animals, effects of boron on myogenesis and myo-regeneration remains to be  solved. In the current study, we investigated dose-dependent activity of boric  acid on myogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs)  using immunocytochemical, gene, and protein expression analysis. The results  revealed that while low- (81.9 μM) and high-dose (819.6 μM) boron treatment  increased myogenic gene expression levels such as myosin heavy chain (MYH), MyoD,  myogenin, and desmin at day 4 of differentiation, high-dose treatment decreased  myogenic-related gene and protein levels at day 21 of differentiation, confirmed  by immunocytochemical analysis. The findings of the study present not only an  understanding of boron's effect on myogenic differentiation but also an  opportunity for the development of scaffolds to be used in skeletal tissue  engineering and supplements for embryonic muscle growth. However, fine dose  tuning and treatment period arranging are highly warranted as boron treatment  over required concentrations and time might result in detrimental outcomes to  myogenesis and myo-regeneration.},

Therefore, PKA has been viewed increasingly as potential  target for variety of drugs and environmental endocrine disruptors.  Consequentially, the preparation of PKA protein became an important initial step  for the subsequent exploration of PKA's character in endocrine disrupting effects  of pesticides. To investigate PKA protein, which is potential to be the  environmental endocrine toxicity target of triazole fungicides, a strategy to  heterologously express protein kinase A catalytic alpha subunit of human (hPKAcα)  and zebrafish (zPKAcα) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21(DE3) host cells was  demonstrated. After optimizing conditions and protein purification, we  successfully obtained enzymatically active hPKAcα and zPKAcα. Western blot  analysis indicated that the recombinant hPKAcα and zPKAcα still retained their  characteristic antigenicity and binding activity, while in vitro kinase activity  assays revealed that the recombinant hPKAcα and zPKAcα maintained enzyme  activity. By in silico methods including homology modelling and molecular  docking, the affinity of ligands and the models of hPKAcα and zPKAcα were further  tested. The present study offered a valuable method to achieve the prokaryotic  expression of a eukaryotic protein kinase and laid a foundation to facilitate  further investigation of toxicological target of triazole pesticides.},

	abstract = {Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a commonly used organophosphate flame retardant and plasticizer in the United States. Using zebrafish as a model, the overall  objective of this study was to identify potential organs that might be targeted  by TPHP during embryonic development. Based on mRNA-sequencing, TPHP exposure  from 24 to 30 h post fertilization (hpf) and 24 to 48 hpf significantly affected  the abundance of 305 and 274 transcripts, respectively, relative to vehicle (0.1\%  DMSO) controls. In addition to minor effects on cardiotoxicity- and  nephrotoxicity-related pathways, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of  significantly affected transcripts within 30- and 48-hpf embryos revealed that  hepatotoxicity-related pathways were strongly affected following exposure to TPHP  alone. Moreover, while pre-treatment with fenretinide (a retinoic acid receptor  agonist) mitigated TPHP-induced pericardial edema and liver enlargement at 72 hpf  and 128 hpf, respectively, IPA revealed that fenretinide was unable to block  TPHP-induced effects on cardiotoxicity-, nephrotoxicity-, and  hepatotoxicity-related pathways at 48 hpf, suggesting that TPHP-induced effects  on the transcriptome were not associated with toxicity later in development. In  addition, based on Oil Red O staining, we found that exposure to TPHP nearly  abolished neutral lipids from the embryonic head and trunk and, based on  metabolomics, significantly decreased the total abundance of metabolites -  including betaine, a known osmoprotectant - at 48 and 72 hpf. Overall, our data  suggest that, in addition to the heart, TPHP exposure during early development  results in adverse effects on the liver, lipid utilization, and osmoregulation  within embryonic zebrafish.},

Compared with the controls,  cardiac-specific transcription factors (nkx2.5, myh7, myl7, and myh6) exhibited  dysregulated expression patterns after FLU treatment. We next used transcriptome  and qRT-PCR analyses to explore the molecular mechanism of FLU cardiotoxicity.  The transcriptome analysis and interaction network showed that the downregulated  genes were enriched in calcium signaling pathways, adrenergic signaling in  cardiomyocytes, and cardiac muscle contraction. FLU exposure repressed the  cardio-related calcium signaling pathway, associated with apoptosis in the heart  and other manifestations of cardiotoxicity. Thus, the findings provide valuable  evidence that FLU exposure causes disruption of cardiac development in zebrafish  embryos. Our findings will help to promote a better understanding of the toxicity  mechanisms of FLU and act as a reference to explore the rational use and safety  of FLU in agriculture.},

The purpose of this  study was to evaluate the adverse effects of long-term exposure to cyprodinil on  the reproductive system of female zebrafish. After the embryos had been treated  with 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/L cyprodinil for 180 days, we observed that female fish  treated with 1 and 10 μg/L cyprodinil showed decreased sexual attractiveness, a  decreased proportion of primordial follicles in the ovary, an increased  proportion of mature follicles, and increased egg production. Moreover, exposed  females that mated with normal males produced offspring with increased rates of  mortality and deformity (the F1 generation). In addition, the levels of  gonadotropin and testosterone (T) were increased in females after cyprodinil  exposure, especially in the 10 μg/L treated group. After cyprodinil treatment,  some key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis underwent significant  changes. For example, gene expression of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone  receptors (gnrhr1, gnrhr2 and gnrhr4) was significantly downregulated after  cyprodinil treatment. The study found that expression of the aromatase  (cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1a, cyp19a1a) responsible for  converting T into estradiol was significantly downregulated after cyprodinil  treatment, consistent with elevated T levels in the ovaries and muscles. In  summary, these data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the toxicity of  cyprodinil and may inform evaluation of the ecotoxicity of cyprodinil to female  reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.},

However, a need for  more effective and broadly acting countermeasures remains. This study aimed to  develop larval zebrafish as a high-throughput model for evaluating novel  therapeutics against acute organophosphorus exposure. Larval zebrafish at six  days post-fertilization were exposed to acute concentrations of seven  organophosphorus compounds and treated with one of three oximes. Lethality  studies indicated similar relative toxicity to that seen in the established  rodent model, with chemical warfare agents proving more lethal than  organophosphorus pesticides. Additionally, the organophosphorus-specific response  for oxime reactivation of acetylcholinesterase was comparable to what has been  previously reported. Behavioral studies measuring the visual motor response  demonstrated greater efficacy for centrally acting oxime compounds than for those  that are contained to the peripheral tissue.

Drug-treated groups  were exposed to bromocriptine and pramipexole, 30 min prior to haloperidol  exposure at the dose of 2, 5, and 10 μg/mL. Swimming speed, time spent in the  bottom of the tank, and complete cataleptic time were evaluated to assess  behavioral changes. In rats, catalepsy was induced using haloperidol (1.25 mg/kg  i.p.). Drug-treated groups received bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg.) and pramipexole (1  mg/kg) orally. Bar test, block test, and locomotor activity were carried out to  assess behavioral changes. RESULTS: Resveratrol and quercetin showed comparable  inhibition of apoptosis in rats and zebrafish. In anti-cataleptic study,  bromocriptine and pramipexole-treated groups showed significant difference (P {\textless}  0.05) in behavioral parameters as compared to haloperidol control group in both  the experimental organisms. Results obtained from fish model were in correlation  with rat model. CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study revealed that zebrafish  model is highly sensitive and can be used for basic screening of drugs against  PD.},

Changes for hydra in  acute toxicity tests and recovery tests were assessed on an change scale from 0  to 10. The index of the effect on development (TI) for hydras was calculated for  every compound. Changes in zebrafish embryos were assessed using a descriptive  method. Pearson correlation coefficient showed the correlation between the  concentration and the toxic effect in the zebrafish embryos for the substances of  the first group. The study showed that substances having a strong damaging effect  on fetuses cause changes that are apparent and easy to evaluate both in hydras  and zebrafish embryos. A scoring system was introduced to evaluate the changes of  hydras and zebrafish embryos. The point system of evaluation of changes allows  quick classification of a substance as potentially embryotoxic, fetotoxic or  teratogenic. It allows developing a cheap and fast method alternative to prenatal  developmental toxicity studies, a screening method that enables substances of  great teratogenic potential to be excluded from studies on laboratory animals.},

Recent  developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing  pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new  techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation  issues, i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used  video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental  contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking  into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects  of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in  our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an  effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations.  Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts  on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no  effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations  reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments.  The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of  tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the  low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates  the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and  understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly,  pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new  computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns.},

Screening a library of 13 plant nutraceuticals led to the identification of  acetyl shikonin and ursolic acid, which exhibited synergy with colistin against  extremely drug resistant (XDR) clinical strains of E. coli (U3790) and K.  pneumoniae (BC936). Ursolic acid caused a significant colistin MIC reversal of  16-fold in U3790 and 4-fold in BC936 strains. Ursolic acid also potentiated the  bactericidal effect of colistin against both U3790 and BC936 by causing {\textasciitilde} 4 to  4.5 log fold decline in CFU of both clinical isolates in a time kill assay. At 2×  minimum effective concentration, ursolic acid was non-toxic to zebrafish as  evidenced by brain and liver enzyme profiles and by histopathology studies. In  combination with colistin, ursolic acid reduced bacterial bioburden of  U3790/BC936 by 1-1.58 log fold from the infected muscle tissue of zebrafish.  Mechanistic explorations via studies on real time efflux, membrane potential and  intracellular accumulation of dansyl chloride tagged colistin revealed that  colistin efflux is inhibited by ursolic acid. In addition, ursolic acid also  enhanced outer membrane permeability which probably facilitates colistin's attack  on outer and inner membranes. Our study shows that ursolic acid synergizes with  colistin by inhibiting colistin efflux in Enterobacteriaceae that helps to  curtail colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.},

Acute organophosphorus poisoning (acute OPP)  affects 3 million people, with 300,000 deaths annually worldwide. Severe acute  OPP effects include overstimulation of cholinergic neurons, seizures, status  epilepticus, and finally, brain damage. In a previous study, we developed three  different chemical models of acute OPP in zebrafish larvae. To elucidate the  complex pathophysiological pathways related to acute OPP, we used integrative  omics (proteomic, transcriptomics and metabolomics) on these three animal models.  Our results show that these stochastic, apparently disparate morphological  phenotypes can result from almost linear concentration-response variations in  molecular levels. Results from the multi-omics analysis strongly suggest that  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress might play a central role in the  pathophysiology of severe acute OPP, emphasizing the urgent need of further  research on this molecular pathway. ER stress could be an important therapeutic  target to be included in the treatment of patients with severe acute OPP.},

Larvae (n = 16-24 per concentration) were exposed to each  chemical (0.0001-120 μM) during development and locomotor activity was assessed.  Approximately half of the chemicals (n = 30) did not show any gross developmental  toxicity (i.e., mortality, dysmorphology or non-hatching) at the highest  concentration tested. Twelve of the 31 chemicals that did elicit developmental  toxicity were toxic at the highest concentration only, and thirteen chemicals  were developmentally toxic at concentrations of 10 µM or lower. Eleven chemicals  caused behavioral effects; four chemicals (6-aminonicotinamide, cyclophosphamide,  paraquat, phenobarbital) altered behavior in the absence of developmental  toxicity. In addition to screening a library of chemicals for developmental  neurotoxicity, we also compared our findings with previously published results  for those chemicals.

The cDNAs of stickleback CYP1A, CYP1B1,  CYP1C1, and CYP1C2 were cloned and their basal and induced expression patterns  were determined in the brain, gill, liver and kidney. Also, their induction time  courses were compared after waterborne exposure to a transient (indigo) or a  persistent (3,3',4,4',5-pentacholorbiphenyl PCB 126) AHR agonist. The cloned  stickleback CYP1s exhibited a high amino acid sequence identity compared with  their zebrafish orthologs and their constitutive tissue distribution patterns  largely agreed with those reported in other species. PCB 126 (100 nM) induced  different CYP1 expression patterns in the four tissues, suggesting  tissue-specific regulation. Both indigo (1 nM) and PCB 126 (10 nM) induced a  strong CYP1 expression in gills. However, while PCB 126 gave rise to a high and  persistent induction in gills and liver, induction by indigo was transient in  both organs. The number of putative dioxin response elements found in each CYP1  gene promoter roughly reflected the induction levels of the genes. The high  responsiveness of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 observed in several organs suggests  that three-spined stickleback is suitable for monitoring of pollution with AHR  agonists.},

A6 also disrupted swimming behavior by affecting the  expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in dopaminergic neurons.Conclusions: In  conclusion, our study provided a mechanistic understanding of the A6 neurotoxic  effect which could be the result of its binding to the estrogen receptor.},

In the present work, the calculated LC(50) of α-CP+ALA was  1.15 μg L(-1), increasing about 1.16-fold compared with that of α-CP group  (0.99 μg L(-1)), which indicated that ALA can alleviate the toxicity of α-CP.

Transcriptome sequencing of the liver showed that ALA rescues the  differential expression of genes involved in the oxidation-reduction, heme  metabolism, and complement activation pathways associated with dysfunctions  induced by α-CP, and these findings were verified by RT-qPCR analysis and  detection of the activities of enzymes in the liver-gut axis. The gut microbiota  16S rRNA sequencing results showed that α-CP alone induced gut microbial  dysbiosis, which was efficiently antagonized by ALA due to decreasing the  relative abundances of Cetobacterium and 3 major pathogens, and increasing the  relative abundances of beneficial genera.

In  this study, the enantioselective toxicity and fate of PYD in Danio rerio were  investigated, and the enantioselective toxic mechanism and metabolic pathway were  explored. The acute toxicity of R-PYD was 10.7-14.7-fold than that of S-PYD  against Danio rerio embryos, larvae, and adults. Meanwhile, R-PYD presented a  stronger effect on embryo hatching and abnormalities, adult tissue damage and  oxidative stress. R-PYD inhibited the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity more  than S-PYD because of its better interaction with SDH with a lower binding free  energy (-59.35 kcal/mol), explaining the mechanism of enantioselective toxicity.  Remarkable enantioselectivity was observed in uptake, distribution, and  elimination. R-PYD showed preferential uptake with the higher uptake rate  constants and slow metabolism with a longer half-life, resulting in the  bioaccumulation of R-PYD with higher BCF(k) (7.37 at 0.05 mg/L and 14.69 at  0.2 mg/L). Besides, muscle is an important tissue for PYD accumulation, existing  potential food risk. Eleven PYD metabolites were qualitatively identified, and  the metabolic pathway was proposed, including hydroxylation, N-demethylation,  demethoxylation, hydrolysation (phase Ⅰ), and acetylation and glucuronidation  (phase Ⅱ). The predicted toxicity of the metabolite indicated that several highly  toxic metabolites need to be considered in the future.

In fact,  intentional food additives (e.g., artificial sweeteners and colors, emulsifiers)  and unintentional compounds (e.g., bisphenol A, pesticides) are largely unstudied  in regard to their effects on overall metabolic homeostasis. With that said, many  of these contaminants have been found to dysregulate endocrine function, insulin  signaling, and/or adipocyte function. Although momentum for the chemical obesogen  hypothesis is growing, supportive, evidence-based research is lacking. In order  to identify noxious synthetic compounds in the environment out of the thousands  of chemicals that are currently in use, tools and models from toxicology should  be adopted (e.g., functional high throughput screening methods, zebrafish-based  assays). Finally, mechanistic insight into obesogen-induced effects will be  helpful in elucidating their role in the obesity epidemic as well as preventing  and reversing their effects.},

	abstract = {There is a spectrum of approaches to neurotoxicological science from high-throughput in vitro cell-based assays, through a variety of experimental  animal models to human epidemiological and clinical studies. Each level of  analysis has its own advantages and limitations. Experimental animal models give  essential information for neurobehavioral toxicology, providing cause-and-effect  information regarding risks of neurobehavioral dysfunction caused by toxicant  exposure. Human epidemiological and clinical studies give the closest information  to characterizing human risk, but without randomized treatment of subjects to  different toxicant doses can only give information about association between  toxicant exposure and neurobehavioral impairment. In vitro methods give much  needed high throughput for many chemicals and mixtures but cannot provide  information about toxicant impacts on behavioral function. Crucial to the utility  of experimental animal model studies is cross-species translation. This is vital  for both risk assessment and mechanistic determination. Interspecies  extrapolation is important to characterize from experimental animal models to  humans and between different experimental animal models. This article reviews the  literature concerning extrapolation of neurobehavioral toxicology from  established rat models to humans and from zebrafish a newer experimental model to  rats. The functions covered include locomotor activity, emotion, and cognition  and the neurotoxicants covered include pesticides, metals, drugs of abuse, flame  retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. With more complete understanding  of the strengths and limitations of interspecies translation, we can better use  animal models to protect humans from neurobehavioral toxicity.},

Herein, we utilized  shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to reveal the aquatic eco-risk  of phoxim. Seven days of phoxim exposure significantly changed the composition of  aquatic microbial community, obliterated the interactions between microorganisms,  and thus reduced the complexity and stability of the microbial community. During  long-time exposure (i.e., 14 days), most of the ecological functions were  restored due to the redundancy of the microbial community. However, phoxim  exposure promoted the dissemination of elfamycin resistance gene. The zebrafish  gut microbial community also recovered from a temporary ecological disorder of  aquatic microbiota, but phoxim continually affected zebrafish growth and swimming  behavior. Overall, our results demonstrated that phoxim exposure significantly  changed the structure and function of the microbial community and displayed a  negative impact on freshwater ecosystems in a short exposure time.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment of chemicals is usually conducted for individual chemicals whereas mixtures of chemicals occur in the environment. Considering that  neuroactive chemicals are a group of contaminants that dominate the environment,  it is then imperative to understand the combined effects of mixtures. The  commonly used models to predict mixture effects, namely concentration addition  (CA) and independent action (IA), are thought to be suitable for mixtures of  similarly or dissimilarly acting components, respectively. For mixture toxicity  prediction, one important challenge is to clarify whether to group neuroactive  substances based on similar mechanisms of action, e.g., same molecular target or  rather similar toxicological response, e.g., hyper- or hypoactivity (effect  direction). We addressed this by using the spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of  zebrafish embryos, which represents the earliest observable motor activity in the  developing neural network, as a model to elucidate the link between the mechanism  of action and toxicological response. Our objective was to answer the following  two questions: (1) Can the mixture models CA or IA be used to predict combined  effects for neuroactive chemical mixtures when the components share a similar  mode of action (i.e., hyper- or hypoactivity) but show different mechanism of  action? (2) Will a mixture of chemicals where the components show opposing effect  directions result in an antagonistic combined effect? Results indicate that  mixture toxicity of chemicals such as propafenone and abamectin as well as  chlorpyrifos and hexaconazole that are known to show different mechanisms of  action but similar effect directions were predictable using CA and IA models.  This could be interpreted with the convergence of effects on the neural level  leading to either a collective activation or inhibition of synapses. We also  found antagonistic effects for mixtures containing substances with opposing  effect direction. Finally, we discuss how the STC may be used to amend risk  assessment.},

In this study, WWTP influent, effluent, and sludge, and  upstream and downstream waters from the WWTP recipient were investigated at 15  locations for a total of 164 CECs, including pharmaceuticals, personal care  products, industrial chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and  pesticides. In addition, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo toxicity tests (ZFET)  were applied to WWTP influent and effluent, and upstream and downstream waters  from WWTP recipients. A total of 119 CECs were detected in at least one sample,  mean concentrations ranging from 0.11 ng/L (propylparaben) to 64,000 ng/L  (caffeine), in wastewater samples and from 0.44 ng/L (ciprofloxacin) to  19,000 ng/L (metformin) in surface water samples. Large variations of CEC  concentrations were found between the selected WWTPs, which can be explained by  differences in CEC composition in influent water and WWTP treatment process. The  sludge-water partitioning coefficient (K(d)) of CECs showed a significant linear  correlation to octanol/water partition coefficient (K(OW)) (p {\textless} 0.001), and thus  could be used for predicting their fate in the aqueous and solid phase. The ΣCEC  concentrations in WWTPs declined by on average 60\%, based on comparisons of WWTP  influent and effluent concentrations. The high concentrations of CECs in WWTP  effluent resulted in, on average, 50\% higher concentrations of CECs in water  downstream of WWTPs compared with upstream. Some WWTP samples showed toxicity in  ZFET compared with the respective control group, but no individual CECs or groups  of CECs could explain this toxicity. These results could provide a theoretical  basis for optimization of existing treatment systems of different designs, and  could significantly contribute to protecting recipient waters.},

Exposure to acetochlor at concentrations 50 µM and above exerted 100\%  mortality after 3 dpf, and significantly reduced the size of the swim bladder  (25 µM). In embryos, basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production, and  maximal respiration were decreased 30-60\% following a 24 h exposure to 125 μM  acetochlor. Acetochlor did not affect ROS levels up to 25 µM in larvae with acute  exposure. Acetochlor at 25 µM increased mRNA levels of bax1, hsp70, and hsp90a by  {\textasciitilde}4-fold in larval zebrafish. In both the visual motor response and light-dark  preference test, 25 µM acetochlor increased locomotor activity of larval fish.

The characteristics of the fabricated nanomaterials were extensively explored by  several analytical techniques such as field emission-scanning electron  microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. Magnetic  and thermal properties were investigated by superconducting quantum interference  device and thermogravimetric measurements. The kinetic and isothermal models  affirmed the adsorption behavior of the PAN-PEI/Fe nanofibers, and further  regenerative studies substantiated the sustainability of the mats for the removal  of industrial dye effluents.

Disk diffusion method and microscopic investigations  corroborated the disinfection efficacy with zone of inhibitions of ∼23 and 33 mm,  respectively. Interestingly, in vitro cell culture studies conducted in BHK-21  and NIH 3T3 cell lines demonstrated the cytocompatibility, and the in vivo  toxicity investigations using the zebrafish models necessitated the real-time  application of these nanofibrous mats.

This  is the first report to use citric acid as a modifier for producing mesoporous  nano HAp and F-doped FHAp. The obtained samples were characterized by different  analyses. The XRD data revealed that F is incorporated well into the HAp crystal  structure. The crystallinity of HAp samples was improved and the unit cell volume  was lowered with fluorine incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  images of the obtained samples revealed that a nano rod-like shape was obtained.  The mesoporous structures of the produced HAp samples were confirmed by  Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. In vivo studies performed using zebrafish  and C. elegans prove the non-toxic behavior of the synthesized F doped HAp  samples.

There is presently no cure for ALS, and only two drugs are  available, neither of which provide significant extension of life.

Epidemiological evidence worldwide implicates  exposures to bacterial toxins, heavy metals, pesticides, and trauma as probable  environmental factors.

	abstract = {AIM: Our previous study reported a strain that can detoxify Jatropha curcas L. cake (JCC), but the detoxification duration is long. This study intends to  explore the efficient detoxification of JCC through multi-strain collaborative  fermentation to accelerate the detoxification process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mucor  circinelloides SCYA25 strain that we previously reported can effectively degrade  the toxicity of JCC, and the newly screened Bacillus megaterium SCYA10 and  Geotrichum candidum SCYA23 strains were used to detoxify JCC. Different  solid-state-fermentation (SSF) parameters were optimized by single-factor tests  and response surface methodology. A detoxification rate established by zebrafish  toxicity of JCC at 96\% was achieved under the following optimized conditions: the  combination ratio of B. megaterium SCYA10, G. candidum SCYA23 and M.  circinelloides SCYA25 at 2:3:1, a total injection amount of 15.25\%, a feed to  water ratio of 1:0.68, a fermentation temperature of 30.3°C and fermentation  duration of 21.5 days. The protein content of fermented JCC (FJCC) increased,  while the concentrations of ether extract, crude fibre and toxins were all  degraded considerably. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the fermentation  increased the contents of neurotransmitter receptor modulator, emulsifier,  aromatic substances and insecticidal compounds, as well as decreasing the  contents of oxidative stress and neurotoxic substances. A rat feeding trial  showed that the growth performance of the rats provided with the FJCC diet was  similar to that of the corn-soybean meal group, and no lesions in the liver and  kidney were observed. CONCLUSION: The co-bio-fermentation process can effectively  detoxify JCC and improve its nutritional value, which means it could be served as  a protein feed in animal husbandry. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of three  microbial strains can detoxify JCC in a safe and effective manner to provide a  great potential alternative to soybean meal. The research also suggests that  metabonomics and bioinformatics are useful tools for revealing the  bio-detoxification mechanism.},

Herein, we describe the suitability of the asexual  freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a new animal model for the study of  developmental neurotoxicology. As these asexual animals reproduce by binary  fission, followed by regeneration of missing body structures within approximately  1 week, development and regeneration occur through similar processes allowing us  to induce neurodevelopment "at will" through amputation. This short time scale  and the comparable sizes of full and regenerating animals enable parallel  experiments in adults and developing worms to determine development-specific  aspects of toxicity. Because the planarian brain, despite its simplicity, is  structurally and molecularly similar to the mammalian brain, we are able to  ascertain neurodevelopmental toxicity that is relevant to humans. As a proof of  concept, we developed a 5-step semiautomatic screening platform to characterize  the toxicity of 9 known neurotoxicants (consisting of common solvents,  pesticides, and detergents) and a neutral agent, glucose, and quantified effects  on viability, stimulated and unstimulated behavior, regeneration, and brain  structure. Comparisons of our findings with other alternative toxicology animal  models, such as zebrafish larvae and nematodes, demonstrated that planarians are  comparably sensitive to the tested chemicals. In addition, we found that certain  compounds induced adverse effects specifically in developing animals. We thus  conclude that planarians offer new complementary opportunities for developmental  neurotoxicology animal models.},
