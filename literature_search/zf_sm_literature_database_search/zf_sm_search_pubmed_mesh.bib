	abstract = {Pesticides are widely used to eradicate insects, weed species, and fungi in agriculture. The half-lives of some pesticides are relatively long and may have  the dire potential to induce adverse effects when released into the soil,  terrestrial and aquatic systems. To assess the potential adverse effects of  pesticide pollution in the aquatic environment, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and  Daphnia magna are two excellent animal models because of their transparent  bodies, relatively short development processes, and well-established genetic  information. Moreover, they are also suitable for performing high-throughput  toxicity assays. In this study, we used both zebrafish larvae and water flea  daphnia neonates as a model system to explore and compare the potential toxicity  by monitoring locomotor activity. Tested animals were exposed to 12 various types  of pesticides (three fungicides and 9 insecticides) for 24 h and their  corresponding locomotor activities, in terms of distance traveled, burst  movement, and rotation were quantified. By adapting principal component analysis  (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis, we were able to minimize data  complexity and compare pesticide toxicity based on locomotor activity for  zebrafish and daphnia. Results showed distinct locomotor activity alteration  patterns between zebrafish and daphnia towards pesticide exposure. The majority  of pesticides tested in this study induced locomotor hypo-activity in daphnia  neonates but triggered locomotor hyper-activity in zebrafish larvae. According to  our PCA and clustering results, the toxicity for 12 pesticides was grouped into  two major groups based on all locomotor activity endpoints collected from both  zebrafish and daphnia. In conclusion, all pesticides resulted in swimming  alterations in both animal models by either producing hypo-activity,  hyperactivity, or other changes in swimming patterns. In addition, zebrafish and  daphnia displayed distinct sensitivity and response against different pesticides,  and the combinational analysis approach by using a phenomic approach to combine  data collected from zebrafish and daphnia provided better resolution for  toxicological assessment.},

In the  present study, zabrafish embryos were exposed to several concentrations of  famoxadone-cymoxanil at 10 hpf. Then, the changes of their shape, heart rate,  development and function of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative stress,  apoptosis, the expression of apoptosis-related genes and immune-related genes,  the locomotor behavior were observed and detected in acute toxicity of  famoxadone-cymoxanil. Our studies showed that, after exposure to  famoxadone-cymoxanil, zebrafish embryos had decreased heart rate, shortened body  length, swollen yolk sac. Secondly, the number of innate and adaptive immune  cells was significantly reduced; and neutrophil migration and retention at the  injury area were inhibited, indicating the developmental toxicity and  immunotoxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil on the zebrafish. We also found that the  oxidative stress related indicators of embryos were changed significantly, and  apoptosis were substantially increased. Further investigation of changes of some  key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MYD88 and NF-κB p65 revealed that the  mRNA expression of these genes was up-regulated. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression  of some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL6 and IL-1β was also  up-regulated. In addition, the activity, the total distance, time and average  speed were decreased along with the increase of exposure concentration. The  absolute turn angle, sinuosity and the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) were also increased. These results suggested that famoxadone-cymoxanil can  induce developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity and neurobehavioral toxicity in  zebrafish larvae.},

	abstract = {Strobilurin fungicides have been frequently detected in aquatic environments and can induce mitochondrial toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms. However, the  derived toxicity and subsequent mechanisms related to their adverse effects are  not fully elucidated. In the present study, we compared the mitochondrial and  developmental toxicity of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin using  zebrafish embryo/larvae. The results showed that all three strobilurins inhibited  mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration (the potency is  pyraclostrobin ≈ trifloxystrobin {\textgreater} azoxystrobin). Behavioral changes indicated  that sublethal doses of pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin caused hyperactivity of  zebrafish larvae in dark cycles, whereas trifloxystrobin resulted in hypoactivity  of zebrafish larvae. In addition, pyraclostrobin exposure impaired the inflation  of swim bladder, and caused down-regulation of annexin A5 (anxa5) mRNA levels,  and up-regulated transcript levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a (pbx1a);  conversely, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin did not cause detectable effects  with swim bladder inflation. Molecular docking results indicated that  azoxystrobin had higher interacting potency with iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD),  prolactin receptor (PRLR), antagonistic conformation of thyroid hormone receptor  β (TRβ) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) compared to pyraclostrobin and  trifloxystrobin; pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin were more likely to interact  with the antagonistic conformation of TRβ and GR, respectively. These results may  partially explain the different effects observed in behavior and swim bladder  inflation, and also point to potential endocrine disruption induced by these  strobilurins. Taken together, our study revealed that all three strobilurins  alter mitochondrial bioenergetics and cause developmental toxicity. However, the  toxic phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of each chemical may differ, and this  requires further investigation. Pyraclostrobin showed higher mitochondrial  toxicity at lethal doses and higher developmental toxicity at sublethal doses  compared to the two other strobilurins tested. These results provide novel  information for toxicological study as well as risk assessment of strobilurin  fungicides.},

Studies indicated that the spinetoram exposed zebrafish embryos showed  yolk sac edema, slow growth, decreased heart rate, decreased number of immune  cells, delayed thymic development and cell apoptosis. In addition, there were  also significant changes in oxidative stress related indicators in zebrafish, the  content of ROS and MDA and the activity of CAT and SOD increased with the  increase of spinetoram concentration. Moreover, we detected the expression of  TLR4 related genes including TLR4, MYD88 and NF-κB p65 which were significantly  up-regulated in the treated groups. Meanwhile, we also found that  pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and CXCL-c1c were up-regulated, but  anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was down-regulated in the treated groups. Briefly,  our results show that spinetoram induces the developmental toxicity and  immunotoxicity of zebrafish to a certain extent, providing basis for the further  research on the molecular mechanism of spinetoram exposure to aquatic ecosystems.},

In this  study, we aimed to investigate the lethal and transcriptional responses of  individual and combined pesticides (iprodione, pyrimethanil, pyraclostrobin and  acetamiprid) on zebrafish (Danio rerio). Semi-static toxicity test indicated that  the greatest toxicity to the four life stages (embryonic, larval, juvenile and  adult stages) of D. rerio was detected from pyraclostrobin, followed by iprodione  and pyrimethanil. In contrast, the lowest toxicity to the organisms was found  from acetamiprid. Most of the selected pesticides exerted greater toxicities to  D. rerio of embryonic stage compared with other life stages. Synergistic  responses were observed from all binary mixtures of iprodione in combination with  pyrimethanil or acetamiprid and ternary mixtures of iprodione+pyraclostrobin in  combination with pyrimethanil or acetamiprid. The expressions of 16 genes related  to cell apoptosis pathway, oxidative stress response, innate immunity and  endocrine disruption at the mRNA level showed that zebrafish embryos were  affected by the individual or combined pesticides. The expressions of P53, Tnf,  TRβ, Tsh and Cyp19a exhibited greater changes upon exposure to combined  pesticides compared with individual pesticides. Taken together, increased  toxicity might be triggered by the simultaneous presence of several pesticides in  the aquatic environment, which seriously damaged the non-target organisms.},

	abstract = {Herbicides are the most widely used group of pesticides but after reaching water bodies they are able to cause adverse effects on non-target organisms. Different  formulations using the same active ingredient are frequently available, which  raises the issue of potential influence of different formulation types on  herbicide toxicity. The present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic  effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampa(®) EC  and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish  embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the way of  active substance release. This investigation is the first report on zebrafish  embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The technical active  ingredient and formulations caused mortality and diverse teratogenic effects,  showing different levels of toxicity. The LC(50) values for the technical  ingredient, Rampa(®) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS were 61.4, 9.6 and 92.5mg a.i./l,  respectively. Spontaneous movements in 22 hpf embryos decreased under exposure to  both the technical ingredient and formulations. A significant number of  underdeveloped embryos was detected after exposure to clomazone and Rampa(®) EC,  while no underdevelopment was noted in embryos exposed to GAT Cenit 36 CS.  Exposure to the technical ingredient and formulations led also to a series of  morphological changes and interfered with the growth of zebrafish embryos. The  EC(50) based on detection of edemas, spine and tail tip deformations and gas  bladder absence (120hpf) was 12.1, 10.1 and 24.1mg/l for technical clomazone,  Rampa(®) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, while teratogenicity index (TI) based on  LC(50)/EC(50) ratio was 5.1, 1 and 3.8, respectively. The data in this study  showed that the emulsifiable concentrate formulation (Rampa(®) EC) caused  statistically significantly higher toxicity, and the aqueous capsule suspension  (GAT Cenit 36 CS) lower toxicity than technical clomazone. It indicates that  different formulations with the same active ingredient may have different  environmental impacts, which is why risk assessment based only on active  ingredient toxicity might not be sufficient in terms of preventing formulation  effects on the environment.},

However, there is no evidence of acute toxicity attributable to propineb in  zebrafish. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the toxicity of propineb  in zebrafish by studying its adverse effects on embryo development, angiogenesis,  and notochord development. Embryos with propineb exposure developed morphological  and physiological defects and in larvae, apoptosis and notochord defects were  induced in the early development stage. Transgenic fli1:eGFP zebrafish exposed to  propineb showed abnormal larval development with defects in angiogenesis and  deformed vasculature. Propineb induced irreversible damage to the neural  development of embryos and neurogenic defects in developing zebrafish in  transgenic olig2:dsRED zebrafish.

And we unravelled that boscalid induced  developmental defects associated with oxidative stress. Developmental defects,  including head deformity, hypopigmentation, decreased number of newborn neurons,  structural defects around the ventricle, enlarged intercellular space in the  brain, and nuclear concentration, were observed in zebrafish embryos after  boscalid exposure at 48 hpf. Interestingly, we found that boscalid might directly  induce oxidative stress and alter the activity of ATPase, which in turn disrupted  the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and transmitter-transmitting  signalings and melanocyte differentiation and melanin synthesis signalings.  Ultimately, the differentiation of nerve cells and melanocytes were both impacted  and the synthesis of melanin was inhibited, leading to morphological  abnormalities. Additionally, exposure to boscalid led to less and imbalance  motion and altered tendency of locomotor in larval fish.

This study used zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to assess the  enantioselective toxicity of benoxacor and its effects on biological activity and  development from 2 h to 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). Results showed that  benoxacor had negative effects on hatchability, malformations, and mortality.  Compared to either individual enantiomer, embryos exposed to Rac-benoxacor had  higher acute and developmental toxicities, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities, and nrf 2 expression levels. They  also had lower superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  reductase (GR) enzyme activity and krt 17, tbx 16, osx, cat, bcl 2, bax, and ifn  expression levels. High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that Rac-benoxacor had  a greater effect on gene regulation than either enantiomer. Gene Ontology  enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses  demonstrated that changes in oxidoreductase activity, cellular lipid metabolic  process, and catalytic activity related genes may be due to the enantioselective  effects of benoxacor isomers. These results suggest that the ecotoxicology data  and safety knowledge about the effects of chiral benoxacor on zebrafish should be  considered in future environmental risk evaluation.},

This study evaluated the acute toxicity of  prothioconazole to zebrafish embryos by assessing their hatching rate and  malformation when exposed to different concentrations of prothioconazole. The 96  h-LC(50) value of zebrafish embryos was 1.70 mg/L. Upon exposure to 0.85 mg/L,  the mortality rate of the embryos significantly increased while their hatching  rate decreased significantly. At prothioconazole concentrations higher than  0.43 mg/L, developmental morphologic abnormalities such as heart and yolk-sac  edema, spine curvature, tail deformity, shortened body length and decreased eye  area were observed. The heart rate of embryos decreased in a dose-dependent  fashion during the exposure time. Prothioconazole exposure also resulted in  increased rates of cardiac malformation detected by significant increase in the  distance between the sinus venosus and bulbus arteriosus and the pericardium  area. Moreover, the expression levels of genes related to cardiac development  (amhc, vmhc, fli1, hand2, gata4, nkx2.5, tbx5 and atp2a2a) were significantly  altered after exposure to prothioconazole. Indeed, this study revealed the  adverse effects on the developmental and cardiovascular system of zebrafish  embryo caused by prothioconazole.

This study  reports the acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant  response of fluralaner in zebrafish. All LC(50) values of fluralaner to zebrafish  were higher than 10 mg L(-1) at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the  bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal  concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1)) for 15 d and then held 6 d  in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06  (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1) fluralaner,  respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113 mg kg(-1)  was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After  exposure in 2.00 mg L(-1) fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST,  GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were  significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the  control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A  were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L(-1) of fluralaner.  Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure  periods. Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO(®)) are of low toxicity  to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after  exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved  in the fluralaner-induced toxicity. Among them, the activities of CAT and CarE,  and most mRNA expression level of CYPs showed fast response to the sub-lethal  concentration of fluralaner, which could be used as a biomarker relevant to the  toxicity.},

Pyrethroids are a class of chiral  insecticides that have been shown to have enantioselective toxicity and  biotransformation. However, the influence of metals on enantioselectivity of  pyrethroids has not yet been evaluated. In the present study, the effects of  cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) on the enantioselective toxicity and  metabolism of cis-bifenthrin (cis-BF) were investigated in zebrafish at  environmentally relevant concentrations. The addition of Cd, Cu, or Pb  significantly increased the mortality of zebrafish in racemate and R-enantiomer  of cis-BF-treated groups. In rac-cis-BF- or 1R-cis-BF-treated groups, the  addition of Cd, Cu, or Pb caused a decrease in enantiomeric fraction (EF) and an  increased ratio of R-enantiomer residues in zebrafish. In 1S-cis-BF-treated  groups, coexposure to Cd led to a lower EF and decreased residue levels of  S-enantiomer. In addition, coexposure to the 3 metals resulted in different  biodegradation characteristics of each enantiomer accompanied with differential  changes in the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1, CYP2, and CYP3 genes, which  might be responsible for the enantioselective biodegradation of cis-BF in  zebrafish. These results suggest that the influence of coexistent metals should  be considered in the ecological risk assessment of chiral pyrethroids in aquatic  environments.

The acute toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl to  embryos, larvae (12 and 72 h post-hatching), and adult zebrafish, as well as the  short-term developmental toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl to embryo and sac-fry  stages, was tested. The results showed that the 96-h LC50 values of  cyhalofop-butyl to embryos, 12 h post-hatching larvae, 72 h post-hatching larvae,  and adult fish were 2.03, 0.58, 1.42, and 3.49 mg/L, respectively, suggesting  zebrafish early life stages were more sensitive to cyhalofop-butyl than adult  stage. Cyhalofop-butyl would inhibit the spontaneous movement, heartbeat,  hatching rate of embryos, and the body length of surviving larvae of zebrafish at  1.00 mg/L or higher concentrations. Morphological abnormalities, including  pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, deformation of tail, and deformation of spine,  were induced by cyhalofop-butyl. The results indicated that cyhalofop-butyl had  significant negative impacts on zebrafish at different life stages, and  spontaneous movement and hatching rate were sensitive endpoints for assessing  short-term developmental toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl.},

In the present study, we demonstrated that toxicity assays of  chlorpropham using zebrafish embryos showed pathological morphology alteration  with half the embryos undergoing embryonic death. Fluorescent dye was used in  live embryos to identify whether oxidative stress and apoptosis mediated  developmental malformation. Specific genes related to apoptosis, ccnd1, ccne1,  and cdk6, belonging to cell cycle regulation were downregulated on exposure to  sublethal concentrations of chlorpropham. Moreover, vascular morphogenesis, which  contributes to the cardiovascular circulatory system, was disrupted by  chlorpropham along with decreased expression of specific regulators (flt1, kdr,  and vegfaa). These data suggest that environmentally preserved chlorpropham is a  potential pollutant in non-target species, especially in aquatic organisms, and  emphasizes the need for caution regarding the ecotoxicity of chlorpropham.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pyrimorph is a novel fungicide being developed in China that shows high antifungal activity against diseases caused by Phytophthora infestans,  Phytophthora capsici, Rhizoctonia solani, Peronophythora litchi and  Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Until now, no information on the toxicity of  pyrimorph to untargeted organisms has been reported. To assess the potential  environmental impacts of pyrimorph in fish, the acute toxicity and  bioconcentration of pyrimorph in zebrafish were studied in this paper. RESULTS:  When tested by the semi-static method, the 48, 72 and 96 h median lethal  concentration (LC50 ) values of pyrimorph to zebrafish were 24.33, 22.61 and  19.79 mg L(-1) respectively. To study the bioconcentration of pyrimorph in  zebrafish, the fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of pyrimorph (2.00  and 0.25 mg L(-1) ) for 192 h, a modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap,  Effective, Rugged and Safe) method was applied to extract pyrimorph from samples  and the residues of pyrimorph in the water and fish were determined by  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The highest bioconcentration  factor (BCF) of pyrimorph in the fish was 1.07 × 10(2) (144 h) and 23.1 (96 h)  after exposure to 2.00 and 0.25 mg L(-1) of pyrimorph respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  The novel fungicide pyrimorph has low toxicity to zebrafish; however, it showed  medium BCF to zebrafish. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the residue  of pyrimorph in fish, as well as to its long-term ecological effects.},

This study examines the developmental toxicity and  neurotoxicity of three synthetic organic insecticides, including deltamethrin  (DM), acephate (AP), and thiamethoxam (TM), using embryo-larval stages of  zebrafish (Danio rerio). Results showed that DM exposure led to embryo  development delay and a significant increase in embryo mortality at 24 and 48 h  post-fertilization (hpf). DM and AP decreased embryo chorion surface tension at  24 hpf, along with the increase in hatching rate at 72 hpf. Moreover, DM caused  ntl, shh, and krox20 misexpression in a dose-dependent manner with morphological  deformities of shorter body length, smaller eyes, and larger head-body angles at  10 μg/L. TM did not show significant developmental toxicity. Furthermore, results  of larval rest/wake assay indicated that DM ({\textgreater}0.1 μg/L) and AP (0.1 mg/L)  increased activity behavior with different patterns. Interestingly, as an  insect-specific pesticide, TM still could alter locomotor activity in zebrafish  larvae at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L. Our results indicate that different  types of synthetic organic insecticides could create different toxicity outcomes  in zebrafish embryos and larvae.},

Fish embryo acute toxicity tests are highly predictive  of aquatic embryotoxicity outcome. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  were exposed to hymexazol at varying concentrations for the study of the  developmental toxicity, melanin biosynthesis, biochemical and transcriptional  endpoints. The embryotoxicity tests indicated that the 96h LC(50) value of  hymexazol was 649mg/L with a 95\% confidence interval range of 632-667mg/L.  Hymexazol at concentrations of 417-738mg/L decreased the heart rate and increased  the voluntary swing. Hymexazol inhibited normal development at concentrations  above 554mg/L. the 96h EC(50) was 411mg/L. Hymexazol in a concentration range of  417-738mg/L induced cardiac edema and yolk sac edema. Exposure of hymexazol at  such concentrations to zebrafish embryos for 48h decreased the pigment area  density compared with the no hymexazol control. Tyrosinase activity was inhibited  by hymexazol relative to the untreated control. The P53 mRNA expression level in  embryos upon exposure to 480mg/L or greater of hymexazol was significantly higher  than that of the control. The results indicated that hymexazol has quite low  acute toxicity and low embryotoxicity to zebrafish.},

However, the  toxicity of nano-enabled pesticides, including azoxystrobin (Az), has not been  well studied compared with their conventional form. This study investigates both  lethal and sub-lethal endpoints in zebrafish embryos up to 120 h  post-fertilization (hpf) under either laboratory light or simulated UV light. The  median lethal concentration (LC50) value of nano-enabled Az (nAz) was  significantly lower than the conventional form (Az). Interestingly, artificial UV  light significantly increased toxicity (decreased LC50) of both Az and nAz.  Malformations were not observed but the remaining yolk sac volume was  significantly increased in both types of Az at both light conditions. This  decreased yolk consumption is in agreement with reduced oxygen consumption and  heart rate. Catalase enzyme activity was only reduced to UV light while  superoxide dismutase activity was significantly reduced by co-exposure of UV  light, and either type of Az at a nominal concentration of 100 μg L(-1). The  co-exposure of Az at 100 μg L(-1) and UV light significantly upregulated sod1,  sod2, and gpx1b expression and both types of Az significantly reduced gpx1a  expression. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in nAz and Az at  100 μg L(-1) under laboratory light, while UV light induced even higher level of  lipid peroxidation. The results will provide important information on the  toxicity of nAz under ecologically realistic conditions.},

The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3days post-fertilization and adults were  exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) or Roundup(®) (0.01, 0.065, and  0.5mg/L) for 96h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of  locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and  exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult  zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the  locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup(®) exposure  when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to  glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5mg/L, Roundup(®) at 0.065 or 0.5mg/L  reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult  zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5mg/L  of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5mg/L of Roundup(®)-treated adult zebrafish  demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup(®)  reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences  between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup(®), altering morphological  and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity  and cellular response.},

Accordingly, experimental groups were  exposed to three sublethal concentrations of pesticides for 96 h, separately, and  then zebrafish were transferred to pesticide-free conditions for 10 and 20 days  recovery periods. Biochemical markers were assessed including carboxylesterase  (CaE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), lactate  dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, alanine and aspartate  aminotransferase (ALT, AST) activities after the exposure and recovery periods.  Also, the pesticide concentrations in test water were quantified by  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Our results showed that  AChE and CaE activities were significantly inhibited and GST was induced by both  pesticides after 96 h exposure. For PBP exposure, the decreases for GST induction  and CaE inhibition showed a partial recovery in pesticide-free conditions.  However, the decreases in AChE activity for CBP exposure and insufficient  increases in same enzyme activity for PBP exposure after 20 days in  pesticide-free conditions indicated that the projected recovery period was not  enough to the recovery of AChE activities and for the improvement of fish health.},

The  use of fish embryos represents an attractive model for studies aimed at  understanding toxic mechanisms and the environmental risk assessment of  chemicals. In the present study, a zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo model was  employed in order to assess the effects of two commonly used pesticides, the  insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron, on zebrafish early life stages.  Since it was previously established that diazinon and diuron cause effects at the  whole-organism level, this study assessed the suborganismic responses to exposure  to these pesticides and the enzymatic responses (biochemical level) and the gene  expression changes (molecular level) were analyzed. Different exposure scenarios  were employed and the following endpoints measured: acetylcholinesterase (AChE),  carboxylesterase (CES), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD),  glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)  activities; and gene expressions of the corresponding genes: acetylcholinesterase  (ache), carboxylesterase (ces2), cytochrome P450 (cyp1a),  glutathione-S-transferase (gstp1), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx1a)  and additionally glutathione reductase (gsr). Significant changes at both the  biochemical and the molecular level were detected. In addition, different  sensitivities of different developmental stages of zebrafish were determined and  partial recovery of the enzyme activity 48h after the end of the exposure was  observed. The observed disparity between gene expression changes and alterations  in enzyme activities points to the necessity of monitoring changes at different  levels of biological organization. Different exposure scenarios, together with a  comparison of the responses at the biochemical and molecular level, provide  valuable data on the effects of diazinon and diuron on low organizational levels  in zebrafish embryos and larvae.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin (MLT)  was able to protect against FEN-induced behavior, oxidative stress, apoptosis,  and neurogenesis using zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Zebrafish exposed to 100  μg/L FEN for 120 h exhibited decreased swimming activity accompanied by  downregulated expression of neurogenesis-related genes (Dlx2, Shha, Ngn1, Elavl3,  and Gfap), suggesting that neurogenesis were impaired. In addition, FEN exposure  significantly elevated oxidative stress as evidenced by increased malondialdehyde  levels, as well as activities of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD),  catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Acridine orange staining demonstrated that  embryos treated with FEN for 120 h significantly enhanced apoptosis mainly in the  brain. FEN also produced upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic  genes (Bax, Fas, caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3) and decreased expression of  the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. MLT significantly attenuated the FEN-mediated  oxidative stress, modulated apoptotic-regulating genes, and diminished apoptotic  responses. Further, MLT blocked the FEN-induced effects on swimming behavior as  well as on neurogenesis-related genes. In conclusion, MLT protected against  FEN-induced developmental neurotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibiting  pesticide-mediated oxidative stress in zebrafish.},

The spinal cord neutrophil infiltration, increased ROS  production, caspase 3 and 9 activation, central nerve and peripheral motor neuron  damage, axon and myelin degeneration were observed in zebrafish treated with BPMC  generally in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of eight marker genes for  nervous system function or development, namely, a1-tubulin, shha, elavl3, gap43,  syn2a, gfap, mbp and manf, was significantly downregulated following BPMC  exposure. AChE activity reduction and ache gene expression suppression was also  found significantly in BPMC-treated zebrafish.

In the present study, early developmental stage zebrafish  were used as the subject organisms to assess the toxicity of EPX, and the  possible mechanism of toxicity was also discussed by biochemical and  transcriptomic analysis. Through embryo toxicity test, we had made it clear that  the 96 h LC(50) of embryo was 7.204 mg/L, and acute exposure to EPX effected  hatching rate, heartbeats, body length and even morphological defects. Then, by  being exposed to EPX for 7 days at concentrations of 175 (1/40 LC(50)), 350 (1/20  LC(50)) and 700 (1/10 LC(50)), biochemical parameters were affected, mainly  manifested as increase of the triglyceride (TG) level and decrease of glucose  content. Correspondingly, the transcription of genes related of glucose  metabolism, lipid metabolism and cholesterol metabolism were also affected  significantly in larval zebrafish. Moreover, some pathways, including lipid  metabolism, glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism were affected through  transcriptome sequencing analysis in the larval zebrafish. Further data analysis  based on the sequencing, EPX exposure also affected the expression of genes  related to cell apoptosis. We further conformed that the bright fluorescence on  the liver and bright spots near the liver by acridine orange staining. In  addition, the mRNA levels of apoptosis related genes were also significantly  affected in the EPX exposed larval zebrafish. Taken together, the work could  provide an insight into toxic effects of EPX on the zebrafish larvae at embryo  toxicity and transcriptional levels, providing some evidences for the toxic  effects of triazole fungicides on non-target organisms.},

	abstract = {Chlorothalonil is a broad spectrum fungicide with high annual production and environmental contamination. Despite its high consumption, studies regarding the  potential ecological risks of chlorothalonil, especially its metabolites, to  aquatic organisms are still limited. In this study, we selected the zebrafish  (Danio rerio) as the in vivo model and first identified the metabolite  (4-hydroxychlorothalonil) of chlorothalonil in zebrafish by tandem  quadrupole/orthogonal-acceleration time-of-flight (Q-TOF). Then, the in vivo and  in vitro models were applied to comprehensively estimate the embryo toxicity and  potential endocrine effect of chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil. The  data from zebrafish embryo toxicity showed that the lowest observed effect  concentrations of both chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil were 50 μg/L  after 96 h of exposure. The mortality rate of the 4-hydroxychlorothalonil was  2.6-fold higher than that of the parent compound at the concentration of 50 μg/L.  Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that both chlorothalonil and  4-hydroxychlorothalonil exerted estrogen receptor α (ERα) agonist activity with  REC(20) values of 2.4 × 10(-8) M and 3.6 × 10(-8) M, respectively. However, only  4-hydroxychlorothalonil exhibited both thyroid receptor β (TRβ) agonistic and  antagonistic activities. Lastly, we employed molecular docking to predict the  binding affinity of chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil with ERα or TRβ.  The results revealed that the potential endocrine effect of chlorothalonil and  4-hydroxychlorothaloni might be attributed to the different binding affinities  with the receptors. In conclusion, our studies revealed that  4-hydroxychlorothalonil exhibited potent endocrine-disrupting effects compared to  its parent compound, chlorothalonil. The results provided here remind us that the  assessment of the potential ecological and health risks of the metabolites of  fungicides in addition to their parent compounds should arouse great concerns.},

This research was  conducted to evaluate the toxicity of fenbuconazole at environmentally relevant  concentrations with attention on the mitochondria, antioxidant system, and  locomotor activity in zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to one concentration of  5, 50, 200 or 500 ng/L fenbuconazole for 96 h. There was no effect on survival  nor percentage of fish hatched, but exposure to 200 and 500 ng/L fenbuconazole  resulted in malformation and hypoactivity in zebrafish. Oxygen consumption rates  (OCR) of embryos were measured to determine if the fungicide impaired  mitochondrial respiration. Exposure to 500 ng/L fenbuconazole reduced basal OCR  and oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration in exposed fish. Fenbuconazole  reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the activities of  mitochondrial Complex II and III. Transcript levels of both sdhc and cyc1, each  related to Complex II and III, were also altered in expression by fenbuconazole  exposure, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in embryos. Fenbuconazole  activated the antioxidant system, based upon both transcriptional and enzymatic  data in zebrafish. Consistent with mitochondrial impairment, molecular docking  confirmed a strong binding capacity of the fungicide at the Q(i) site of Complex  III, revealing this complex is susceptible to fenbuconazole.

This study evaluated the effects of MG on  reproductive success in zebrafish, Danio rerio, and the relative toxicity of MG  oxalate and MG chloride salts. After 5-day exposure to a prophylactic  concentration (0.065 mg/L) of MG oxalate, the percentage of spawning pairs  significantly declined (57.5\%±8.5 SE) and then returned to pre-exposure levels  (89\%±6.6 SE) within one week. Embryo and larval survival were not affected by  exposure of parents to MG; however, when exposed directly, MG oxalate was more  toxic than MG chloride in both life stages. The LC(50) for embryos was 0.067 μM  and 0.116 μM for MG oxalate and MG chloride, respectively, and the LC(50) for  larvae, 0.057 μM and 0.103 μM, respectively. Other than a transient reduction in  the number of fish that spawned, MG treatment of broodstock did not impact  reproductive success, which indicates that MG can be used prophylactically with  minimal effects on reproduction.

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of profenofos to early developing Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (4h post  fertilization) in a static system at 1.0 to 2.25mg/L. Median lethal  concentrations (LC50) of profenofos at 24-h, 48-h, 72-h and 96-h were determined  as 2.04, 1.58, 1.57 and 1.56 mg/L, respectively. The hatching of embryos were  recorded at every 12h interval and the median hatching time (HT50) was also  calculated for each concentration. In a separate set of experiments, 96-h LC10  (0.74 mg/L) and LC50 (1.56 mg/L) concentrations were used to assess the  developmental toxicity in relation to behavior, morphology, and interactions with  the targeted enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Live video-microscopy revealed that the  profenofos exposed embryos exhibited an abnormal development, skeletal defects  and altered heart morphology in a concentration-dependent manner, which leads to  alterations in the swimming behavior of hatchlings at 144-h, which indicate that  developing zebrafish are sensitive to profenofos.},

We aim to investigate the individual and joint effects of OPs and  PYRs exposure on zebrafish embryo by employing chlorpyrifos (CPF) and  deltamethrin (DM) as representatives. Zebrafish embryos at 2 hours post  fertilization (hpf) were exposed to CPF (4.80, 39.06, and 78.13 μg/L), DM  exposure (0.06, 1.60, and 3.19 μg/L), and CPF + DM (4.80 + 0.06, 39.06 + 1.60,  and 78.13 + 3.19 μg/L) until 144 hpf. Embryonic development, locomotor activity,  and metabolomic changes were recorded and examined. Results displayed that  individual exposure to CPF and DM significantly increased the mortality and  malformation rate of zebrafish embryos, but decreased hatching rate was only  found in CPF + DM co-exposure groups (p {\textless} .05). Meanwhile, individual CPF  exposure had no detrimental effect on locomotor activity, high dose of individual  CPF exposure decreased the swimming speed but had adaptability to the conversion  from dark to light, whereas high dose of CPF + DM co-exposure exhibited not only  significant decline in swimming speed but also no adaptability to the repeated  stimulations, suggesting deficit in learning and memory function. In metabolomic  analysis, individual CPF exposure mainly influenced the metabolism of  glycerophospholipids and amino acids, individual DM exposure mainly influenced  glycerophospholipids, and CPF + DM co-exposure mainly influenced  glycerophospholipids and amino acids. Taken together, our findings suggested the  embryonic toxicities and neurobehavioral changes caused by CPF and/or DM  exposure. The disorder metabolomics of glycerophospholipids and amino acids might  be involved in the underlying mechanism of those toxicities.},

Bifenthrin mainly disrupts sodium ion channel  inducing neurotoxicity in the target insects. It also exerts toxic effects such  as hormone dysregulation, hepatotoxicity and immunotoxicity in other vertebrates.  However, there is no evidence of the acute-toxicity associated embryogenesis and  organogenesis of bifenthrin in zebrafish. Here we first demonstrated that  bifenthrin induced acute-toxicity accompanying inflammatory response and  physiological degradations resulting in loss of embryogenesis and vascular  development in zebrafish embryos. We found that bifenthrin increased intestinal  ROS accumulation and the inflammatory genes including tnfa, il6, il8 and ptgs2b,  thereby increasing embryo mortality. Moreover, bifenthrin disrupted angiogenesis  by down-regulation of VEGF receptors in embryos. Not only in the zebrafish,  bifenthrin also decreased cell viability and hampered vascular formation of  HUVECs. Collectively, bifenthrin induced developmental toxicity, inflammatory  cell death and anti-angiogenesis during embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {Sulfometuron methyl (SM) is a widely used herbicide and thus leading to accumulation in the environment. The toxicity assessments of SM in model  organisms are currently rare. In the present study, zebrafish were utilized for  evaluating the detrimental effects of SM in aquatic vertebrates. Zebrafish  embryos were exposed to 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM from 5.5 to 72 h  post-fertilization (hpf), respectively. Consequently, SM exposure resulted in  increasing the mortality rate and reducing hatching rate in larval zebrafish at  10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells  (neutrophils and macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent  manner. The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-10,  and TGF-β) were measured to estimate immune responses. Anti-inflammatory factors  (IL-10 and TGF-β) were down-regulated in all the treated groups and significantly  altered at 40 mg/L exposure group. Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that  SM treatment significantly increased the total distance, average speed, and  maximum acceleration of larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and  subsequently enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The  content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS level in  all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were significantly  increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration group induced the  substantial increment (P {\textless} 0.001) of apoptosis-related genes including p53,  Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3. In summary, our results demonstrated that  exposure to SM caused toxicity of development, immune system, locomotor behavior,  oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis at the early developmental stages of  zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Carbosulfan is a carbamate insecticide that has been widely used in agriculture. However, studies showed that carbosulfan could be highly toxic to aquatic  organisms. The metabolism of carbosulfan in adult zebrafish is still largely  unexplored, and the metabolites in individual or in combination may pose a  potential threat to zebrafish. In the present study, the bioaccumulation and  metabolism of carbosulfan in zebrafish (Danio rerio) were assessed, and the main  metabolites, including carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran, were determined. The  toxicity of carbosulfan and its metabolites individually or in combination to  zebrafish was also investigated. The bioaccumulation and metabolism experiment  indicated that carbosulfan was not highly accumulated in zebrafish, with a  bioaccumulation factor of 18 after being exposed to carbosulfan for 15 days, and  the metabolism was fast, with a half-life of 1.63 d. The two main metabolites  were relatively persistent, with half-lives of 3.33 and 5.68 d for carbofuran and  3-hydroxycarbofuran, respectively. The acute toxicity assay showed that  carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran had 96-h LC(50) values of 0.15 and 0.36 mg/L,  showing them to be more toxic than carbosulfan (96-h LC(50) = 0.53 mg/L).  Combinations of binary or ternary mixtures of carbosulfan and its metabolites  displayed coincident synergistic effects on acute toxicity, with additive index  (AI) values of 1.9-14.3. In the livers and gills of zebrafish exposed to  carbosulfan, carbofuran, and 3-hydroxycarbofuran, activities of catalase,  superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase were significantly changed in  most cases, and the content of malondialdehyde was greatly increased, indicating  that carbosulfan and its metabolites induced varying degrees of oxidative stress.  The metabolites were more persistent and toxic to zebrafish and exhibit  coincident synergistic effects in combination. These results can provide evidence  for the potential risk of pesticides and highlight the importance of a systematic  assessment for the combination of the precursor and its metabolites.},

The present study has been conducted to evaluate the effects of high  temperature on acute toxicity of sumithion in adult zebrafish. A 2-day renewal  bioassay system was used to determine the 96 h LC(50) value of sumithion at three  temperature regimes, such as 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C. Blood glucose (mg/dL) level  was measured in control (0.0 mg/L) and low concentration (1.0 mg/L) of sumithion  during the determination of LC(50) in three temperature conditions. In addition,  micronucleus (MN), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), and erythrocytic  cellular abnormalities (ECA) tests were performed in the blood erythrocytes. The  96 h LC(50) value of sumithion for zebrafish was significantly lower at 35 °C,  which indicates that the toxicity of sumithion increases at higher temperature.  Blood glucose level was significantly increased by sumithion in all temperature  conditions, while it was significantly higher in the highest (35 °C) temperature  compared to the lowest (25 °C) temperature in both control and sumithion-treated  fish. Similarly, frequencies of MN, ENA, and ECA were elevated by sumithion in  all temperature conditions, whereas it was significantly raised in the highest  (35 °C) temperature compared to the lowest (25 °C) temperature in both control  and sumithion treated fish. With increasing temperature in exposure to sumithion,  dissolved oxygen decreased significantly, whereas free CO(2) increased  significantly. On the other hand, no distinct changes were observed in pH and  total alkalinity during the experimental period. Therefore, it can be inferred  that increasing temperature enhances the toxicity of sumithion in the zebrafish.},

In this study,  we used zebrafish to investigate the cardiotoxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil and  the potential mechanisms involved. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different  concentrations of famoxadone-cymoxanil until 72 h post-fertilization (hpf), then  changes of heart morphology in zebrafish embryos were observed. We also detected  the levels of oxidative stress, myocardial-cell proliferation and apoptosis,  ATPase activity, and the expression of genes related to the cardiac development  and calcium-signaling pathway. After famoxadone-cymoxanil exposure, pericardial  edema, cardiac linearization, and reductions in the heart rate and cardiac output  positively correlated with concentration. Although myocardial-cell apoptosis was  not detected, proliferation of the cells was severely reduced and ATPase activity  significantly decreased, resulting in a severe deficiency in heart function. In  addition, indicators of oxidative stress changed significantly after exposure of  the embryos to the fungicide. To better understand the possible molecular  mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish, we studied the  transcriptional levels of cardiac development, calcium-signaling pathways, and  genes associated with myocardial contractility. The mRNA expression levels of key  genes in heart development were significantly down-regulated, while the  expression of genes related to the calcium-signaling pathway (ATPase [atp2a1],  cardiac troponin C [tnnc1a], and calcium channel [cacna1a]) was significantly  inhibited. Expression of klf2a, a major endocardial flow-responsive gene, was  also significantly inhibited. Mechanistically, famoxadone-cymoxanil toxicity  might be due to the downregulation of genes associated with the calcium-signaling  pathway and cardiac muscle contraction. Our results found that  famoxadone-cymoxanil exposure causes cardiac developmental toxicity and severe  energy deficiency in zebrafish.},

Results showed that  combined exposure to 25 μg·L(-1) PCP and 25 μg· L(-1) HCB significantly increased  the plasma estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) levels, altered the expressions of  genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver (HPGL) axis, inhibited  gonadal development, and eventually lead to decreased egg production of F0  zebrafish as well as inhibited development of F1 eggs/larvae. Compared to the  combined exposure of high doses, significantly lower levels of plasma E2 and T  were observed for either the high PCP or high HCB alone exposure, indicating a  synergistic effect of the two chemicals on endocrine disruption after  combination. Furthermore, the high PCP alone exposure inhibited the gonadal  development in both the males and females, while the HCB alone exposure did not.  Comparison of exposure effects indicated a greater decrease of mature gametes  levels and egg production in the high combined group when compared to the high  HCB alone group, but no significant difference was observed between the high  combined group and the high PCP alone group. Taken together, the results  suggested that combined exposure to PCP and HCB may synergistically affect  endocrine of zebrafish, and result in reproduction impairments, with PCP being  the primary contributor.},

Seventy-two hpf total malformation index values for 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0  mg/l CNPE doses were 4.3, 7.2 and 7.9, respectively. 1.0 mg/l CNPE is not toxic  for the zebrafish embryos/larvae. 2.0 to 8.0 CNPE doses caused some abnormalities  in embryos/larvae morphology, including lack of body parts, tail deformities,  chorda deformity, bubbled head, scoliosis, lordosis, weak or non-pigmentation,  decreased heart rate and larva length. 16.0 mg/l CNPE caused mortality in 72 hpf.  The expression levels of seven immune system-related genes (il-1β, il-8, cebp,  tlr4, hsp70, NF-kB, and mtf-1) were examined. The transcription level of il-1β,  il-8, tlr4, hsp70, and NF-kB genes significantly increased in the CNPE exposure  groups. While the expression of the mtf-1 gene considerably decreased, the cebp  gene expression level did not change in the 4.0 and 8.0 mg/l CNPE doses. In  conclusion, CNPE could induce developmental toxicity with malformations in  embryos/larvae and alter the gene expression.},

Orbencarb, one of the isomeric  thiocarbamates applied to wheat, maize, and soybean, has been found to have toxic  effects on mammals and marine ecosystems. Although the toxicity ranges of  orbencarb in different organisms are known, specific studies on the environmental  contamination and harmful effects of orbencarb on non-target organisms are  scarce. In this study, we observed that orbencarb induced embryotoxicity during  zebrafish development as well as apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS)  production in the intestine. It was further observed that orbencarb decreased the  viability of the embryos and simultaneously affected the heart rate and vessel  formation. Orbencarb decreased the mRNA levels of ccnd1, ccne1, cdk2, and cdk6  and induced abnormal development of the eyes, brain, yolk sac, and spinal cord in  zebrafish embryos. Orbencarb also hampered vasculogenesis in the zebrafish  embryos by inhibiting the mRNA expression of flt1, flt4, kdr, and vegfc.  Collectively, these results suggested that orbencarb is embryotoxic and disrupts  the normal growth of zebrafish embryos by inducing the generation of ROS and  hampering vasculogenesis.},

We  demonstrated that ACT and its enantiomers could cause time- and  concentration-dependent mortality (72 h LC(50) ranged from 48.4 to 53.1 μM) and  developmental malformations (e.g., 48 h EC(50) for yolk sac edema ranged from  36.7 to 54.1 μM), as well as increase transcription of the key genes involved in  the innate immune system. A consistent enantioselectivity in these endpoints was  observed with (-)-R-ACT showed stronger effects than (+)-S-ACT, and the  transcription levels of il-1β exhibited significant enantioselectivity at  concentrations as low as 8 μM. Further Western blot analysis revealed that  significant elevations of Il-1β protein expression in all (-)-R-ACT treatment  groups. According to the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations,  the enantioselectivity between ACT enantiomers was attributed to the distinct  binding affinity to Il-1β. Overall, our in vivo and in silico studies uniquely  disclosed the enantioselective immunotoxicity of ACT and its underlying  mechanisms and highlighted the need to evaluate the environmental risk of chiral  chloroacetamide herbicide in aquatic organisms at enantiomeric levels.},

However, the potential toxic effects of DM on  organisms and the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this  study, we utilized zebrafish to evaluate the toxicity of DM during the  cardiovascular developmental process. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to 0.75, 1.0  and 1.25 mg/L DM induced cardiac defects, such as pericardial edema, slow heart  rate and long SV-BA distance but the vascular development in zebrafish larvae was  not influenced by DM treatment. The expression of cardiac-related genes were  disordered and DM exposure initiated disordering cardiogenesis from the period of  precardiac mesoderm formation. Moreover, the apoptosis and proliferation of  cardiomyocytes were not influenced but the levels of oxidative stress were  upregulated by DM exposure. Fullerenes and astaxanthin was able to rescue cardiac  defects caused by DM via downregulating oxidative stress. Wnt signaling was  downregulated after DM treatment and activation of Wnt signaling could rescue  cardiac defects. Therefore, our results suggest that DM has the potential to  induce cardiac developmental toxicity through upregulation of Wnt-Mediated  (reactive oxygen species) ROS generation in zebrafish larvae.},

Moreover, the dose-dependent responses of the ECOD activity were  observed after treatment with sublethal concentrations of fipronil in the range  of 2-20 μg/L.

Chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, which is likely to affect  behaviour of the organism. NiCl2 targets the active sites of enzymes and is  regarded as an unspecific toxicant for aquatic organisms. Several endpoints, such  as locomotor activity, morphological abnormalities, and mortality of D. rerio  embryos and larvae were studied. During acute exposures to {\textgreater} or =0.25 mg/L of  chlorpyrifos, locomotor activity tended to increase. However, this activity  decreased significantly at {\textgreater} or =7.5 mg Ni/L. Subchronic exposures to CHP  resulted in behavioural changes at much lower concentrations ({\textgreater} or =0.01 mg/L)  and considerably earlier than the observed increase in morphological  abnormalities and mortality (LC(50) (10 d): 0.43 mg/L). Combined CHP and NiCl2  mixtures led to an antagonistic deviation from the concept of independent action,  in the case of locomotor activity. Compared to developmental or survival  parameters, behaviour was the most sensitive endpoint for CHP exposure in this  study; therefore we recommend this parameter to complement already established  endpoints.},

Cypermethrin,  1 of the top 5 synthetic pyrethroids in use, has been extensively detected in  surface water. Cadmium (Cd) has been recognized as 1 of the most toxic metals and  is a common contaminant in the aquatic system. However, little information is  available regarding their joint toxicity. In the present study, combined toxicity  of cypermethrin and Cd and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Zebrafish  embryos and adults were exposed to the individual contaminant or binary mixtures.  Co-exposure to cypermethrin and Cd produced synergistic effects on the occurrence  of crooked body, pericardial edema, and noninflation of swim bladder. The  addition of Cd significantly potentiated cypermethrin-induced spasms and caused  more oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae. Cypermethrin-mediated induction of  transcription levels and catalytic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme  were significantly down-regulated by Cd in both zebrafish larvae and adults.  Chemical analytical data showed that in vitro elimination of cypermethrin by  CYP1A1 was inhibited by Cd. The addition of Cd caused an elevation of in vivo  cypermethrin residue levels in the mixture-exposed adult zebrafish. These results  suggest that the enhanced toxicity of cypermethrin in the presence of Cd results  from the inhibitory effects of Cd on CYP-mediated biotransformation of this  pesticide. The authors' findings provide a deeper understanding of the  mechanistic basis accounting for the joint toxicity of cypermethrin and Cd.},

Pesticide mixtures of  TRI and IMI displayed synergistic response to zebrafish embryos. Activities of  carboxylesterase (CarE) and catalase (CAT) were significantly changed in most of  the individual and joint exposures of pesticides compared with the control group.  The expressions of 26 genes related to oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis,  immune system, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis at the mRNA level revealed that zebrafish embryos were affected by the  individual or joint pesticides, and greater changes in the expressions of six  genes (Mn-sod, CXCL-CIC, Dio1, Dio2, tsh and vtg1) were observed when exposed to  joint pesticides compared with their individual pesticides.

Sublethal (malformations, hatchability, heart rate, body length, alteration of  spontaneous movement and touch responses) and lethal effects were monitored  during exposure period from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. Zebrafish  embryos exhibited significant mortality and teratogenic effects at acetamiprid  concentration greater than 263 mg/L, with bent spine being the main malformation.  Toxicity spectra were constructed to rank the sensitivity of individual end  points to acetamiprid exposure and impaired spontaneous movement was the most  sensitive end point of those tested. The present study provides the basis for  understanding developmental toxicity of acetamiprid exposure to zebrafish  embryos. This information is critical for future studies evaluating aquatic risk  from neonicotinoids as little is known regarding adverse effects of  neonicotinoids to aquatic vertebrate species.},

Results demonstrated that the larval stage was most  susceptible to AZ in the multiple life stages of zebrafish, with 96 h-LC(50)  value of 0.777 mg/L. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to different AZ concentrations  (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μg/L) and examined on 24, 48 and 72 h. It was found that AZ  induced ROS accumulation, increased GST, GPX and POD activity and the  transcriptions of antioxidant and stress response related genes, while the  opposite trend occurred for SOD and CAT activity in 24-h or 48-h exposure period.  The increased E(2) and VTG levels in zebrafish larvae, and altered transcription  levels of regulatory and steroidogenic genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad  (HPG) axis indicated the endocrine disruption capacity of AZ. The transcripts of  mdm2, p53, ogg1, bcl2, bbc3, cas8 and cas9 involved in cell apoptosis, and the  mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines such as cxcl-c1c, ccl, il-1β, il-8, ifn,  and tnfα were in accordance with the trends of the examined genes involved in  oxidative stress and endocrine system. The results suggested that short-term  exposure to AZ might impose ecotoxicological effects on zebrafish larvae, and the  information presented here also provide molecular strategies and increase  mechanistic understanding of AZ-induced toxic response, and help elucidate the  environmental risks of AZ.},

The enantiomers of beta-CP were baseline  separated on Chiralcel OD and Chiralpak AD columns and detected by circular  dichroism (CD) at 236 nm. Better separation could be achieved at lower  temperature (e.g., 20 degrees C) and with lower levels of polar modifiers. Pure  enantiomers were obtained on Chiralcel OD. The CD spectra of enantiomers were  recorded. By comparing the elution order with a previous similar study, the  absolute configuration of beta-CP enantiomers was determined. The individual  enantiomers were used in zebrafish embryo test, and the results showed that  beta-CP enantioselectively induced yolk sac edema, pericardial edema and crooked  body. The IR-cis-alphaS and 1R-trans-alphaS enantiomers showed strong  developmental toxicities at concentration of 0.1 mg/L, while the 1S-cis-alphaR  and 1S-trans-alphaR induced no malformations at higher concentration (e.g., 0.3  mg/L).

It has been known that DM  negatively affects motion of zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, little is known in  relation to the impacts of DM on development of swim bladder, which is a key  organ for motion. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 20 and  40 µg/L DM. The changes of swim bladder morphology were observed and  transcription levels of key genes were compared between DM treatments and the  control. The results showed that DM treatments significantly blocked the  formation of progenitor and tissue layers in swim bladder of zebrafish embryos,  leading to failed inflation of swim bladder. Compared with the control, the key  genes (pbx1, foxA3, mnx1, has2, anxa5b, hprt1l and elovl1a) responsible for swim  bladder development also showed decreased levels in response to DM treatments,  suggesting that DM might specifically affect swim bladder development. Moreover,  transcription levels of genes in the Wnt (wnt5b, tcf3a, wnt1, wnt9b, fzd1, fzd3  and fzd5) and Hedgehog (ihhb, ptc1 and ptc2) signaling pathways all decreased  significantly in response to DM treatments, compared with the control.  Considering the importance of Wnt and Hedgehog pathways in development of swim  bladder, these results suggested that DM might affect swim bladder development  through inhibiting the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. Overall, the present study  reported that swim bladder might be a potential target organ of DM toxicity in  zebrafish, which contributed more information to the evaluation of DM's  environmental risks.},

Moreover, adult  zebrafish that were exposed to this fungicide (4 and 6 mg/L) showed a decrease in  distance travelled and mean speed when compared to the control group. However,  tebuconazole did not alter the number of line crossings or time spent in the  upper zone.

In this context, the aim of the study was to assess the potential  effects that might occur when aquatic organisms are simultaneously exposed to  multiple chemicals. For that, we have studied the acute effects of cadmium  (0.2 μg L(-1)), nickel (10 μg L(-1)) and deltamethrin (2 μg L(-1)) as individual  toxicants and as mixture on the behavioral responses, oxidative stress (SOD and  GPx), body electrolytes and trace metals profiles of zebrafish (Danio rerio). So  far the scientific literature did not report about the combined effects of  pesticides and toxic metals on zebrafish behavior using a 3D tracking system.  Compared with other studies, in the present paper we investigated the acute  effects of two heavy metals associated with a pesticide on zebrafish, in the  range of environmentally relevant concentrations. Thus, the environmental  concentrations of cadmium and nickel in three rivers affected by urban activities  and one river with protected areas as background control were measured. The  observations that resulted in our study demonstrated that deltamethrin toxicity  was significantly decreased in some of the behavioral variables and oxidative  stress when combined with CdNi mixture. Consequently, our study supports previous  works concerning the combined toxicity of environmental chemicals since their  simultaneous presence in the aqueous environment may lead to higher or lower  toxicological effects on biota than those reported from a single pollutant.  Therefore, the evaluation of toxic effects of a single contaminant does not offer  a realistic estimate of its impact against aqueous ecosystems. This study also  supports the idea that the interactions between different chemical compounds  which do not exceed the maximum permitted limits in environment may have benefits  for aquatic life forms or be more toxic.},

Due to its extensive  application, it has been detected in aquatic ecosystems, raising concerns about  its environmental impact, which is still poorly explored. The objective of this  work was to study the effects of a commercial formulation of azoxystrobin in the  zebrafish embryo model. Sublethal and lethal effects were monitored during the  exposure period from 2 h post fertilisation (hpf) to 96 hpf after exposure to  azoxystrobin concentrations (1, 10 and 100 μg L(-1)). The responses of  antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)) as well as detoxifying enzymes  (glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE)) were evaluated at  96 hpf. Similarly, glutathione levels (reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG)  glutathione), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) and anaerobic  respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) -related enzymes were assayed. At 120  hpf, larvae from each group were used for behaviour analysis. Results from this  study showed concentration-dependent teratogenic effects, particularly by  increasing the number of malformations (yolk and eye), with a higher prevalence  at the highest concentration. However, it was found that the lowest concentration  induced a high generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased activity  of SOD, GST, and CarE. In addition, GR and GSSG levels were decreased by the  lowest concentration, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative stress, which  is also supported by the increased AChE activity and absence of behavioural  changes. These findings advance the knowledge of the azoxystrobin developmental  and environmental impacts, which may impose ecotoxicological risks to non-target  species.},

Subsequently, the wider community became aware  of the potential risks it posed to living organisms and the ecosystem. In this  study, we evaluated the effects of CPPU on the survival, cardiac morphology and  function, as well as hematopoietic system, of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Notably,  CPPU (2.5-12.5 μg/ml) induced cardiac morphology deformation, cardiac contractile  dysfunction and erythrocyte reduction in zebrafish. Consistently, the mRNA  expression levels of several cardiac and hematopoietic gene markers (myl7, gata4,  mef2c, amhc, vmhc and gata1) were altered by CPPU treatment. In addition, CPPU  caused cytotoxicity, cytoskeleton destruction and reduced corresponding proteins  (Myl7, Gata4 and Mef2c) expression in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. Taken  together, this study has identified the cardiotoxicity of CPPU in different  experimental models and enhanced our understanding on the mechanism underlying  the toxicity of CPPU to living organisms.},

The objective of this study was to  assess the acute toxicity of the triazole fungicide cyproconazole to zebrafish  embryos by assessing mortality, developmental defects, morphological abnormality,  oxidative respiration, and locomotor activity following a 96-h exposure.  Zebrafish embryos at 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either a  solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μM  cyproconazole for 96 h. Data indicated that cyproconazole exhibited low toxicity  to zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC(50) value of 90.6 μM ({\textasciitilde} 26.4 mg/L).  Zebrafish embryos/larvae displayed a significant decrease in spontaneous  movement, hatching rate, and heartbeats/20 s with 50, 100, and 250 μM  cyproconazole exposure. Malformations (i.e., pericardial edema, yolk sac edema,  tail deformation, and spine deformation) were also detected in zebrafish exposed  to ≥ 50 μM cyproconazole, with significant increases in cumulative deformity rate  at 48, 72, and 96 hpf. In addition, a 20-30\% decrease in basal and  oligomycin-induced ATP respiration was observed after 24-h exposure to 500 μM  cyproconazole in embryos. To determine if cyproconazole affected locomotor  activity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae following 7-day  exposure to 1, 10, and 25 μM cyproconazole in two independent trials. Activity in  the dark period was decreased for zebrafish exposed to 25 μM cyproconazole in the  first trial, and hypoactivity was also observed in zebrafish exposed to 1 μM  cyproconazole in a second trial, suggesting that cyproconazole can affect  locomotor activity. These data improve understanding of the toxicity of  cyproconazole in developing zebrafish and contribute to environmental risk  assessments for the triazole fungicides on aquatic organisms. We report that,  based on the overall endpoints assessed, cyproconazole exhibits low risk for  developing fish embryos, as many effects were observed above  environmentally-relevant levels.},

	abstract = {Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, but its potential negative effects on aquatic organisms are still poorly understood. This  study examined the effects of clethodim on zebrafish at aspects of early stage  embryonic development, immune toxicity, cell apoptosis and locomotor behavior.  Firstly, clethodim exposure markedly decreased the survival rate, body length,  and heart rate and resulted in a series of morphological abnormalities, primarily  spinal deformities (SD) and yolk sac edema, in zebrafish larvae. Secondly, the  number of immune cells was substantially reduced but the levels of apoptosis and  oxidative stress were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon  clethodim exposure. Thirdly, we evaluated the expression of some key genes in TLR  signaling including TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 and they were all up-regulated by  exposure to 300 μg/L clethodim. Meanwhile, some proinflammatory cytokines such as  TNF-α, IL-1β, IL8, and IFN-γ were also activated in both the mock and the TLR4-KD  conditions. Moreover, the locomotor behaviors and the enzymatic activities of  AChE were obviously inhibited but the levels of acetylated histone H3 were  greatly increased by clethodim exposure. In addition, incubation of zebrafish  larvae with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol can partially rescue  the clethodim-modulated locomotor behavior. Taken together, our results suggest  that clethodim has the potential to induce developmental immunotoxicity and cause  behavioral alterations in zebrafish larvae. The information presented in this  study will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying clethodim  exposure in aquatic ecosystems.},

Fish were divided in  three different groups: CTL, 0.3 μg L(-1) or 0.6 μg L(-1) of CYP and 0.5 or  1 μg L(-1) of CPF in commercial formulation. Both carp and zebrafish showed an  increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity  when compared to control group. Other oxidative parameters responded differently  to exposure in carp and zebrafish. There were an increase in ascorbic acid (ASA)  levels and decrease in catalase (CAT) activity and non-protein thiols (NPSH)  levels in treated groups of carps. In the other hand, zebrafish showed  significant decrease in ASA and increase in CAT activity and NPSH levels.  Overall, we demonstrate noxious effects on redox parameters in two fish  experimental models and different effects were observe in each fish species  exposed to commercial pesticide formulation. This difference responses observed  can be related with specific mechanisms of detoxification and antioxidant defense  system of each species.},

Before the wide application of fluoxastrobin, the present study  was performed to assay the acute and chronic toxicity of fluoxastrobin on  zebrafish (Danio rerio). The 96-hour median lethal concentration (96h LC(50))  after initiation of zebrafish exposure to fluoxastrobin was 0.51mg/L with a 95\%  confidence interval of 0.45 to 0.57mg/L, indicating that fluoxastrobin was highly  toxic to zebrafish. As endpoints, we assayed the levels of reactive oxygen  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase  (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the degree of DNA  damage at three different doses, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1mg/L on days 7, 14, 21, and  28. The antioxidant enzymes partially ameliorated the ROS induced by  fluoxastrobin t and were in turn inhibited by excess ROS, especially at 0.1mg/L.  Lipid peroxidation and DNA damage were stimulated by ROS. The fluoxastrobin  contents of the tested solutions were also determined; at the fluoxastrobin doses  of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1mg/L, the contents on day 28 were 3.9, 5.0, and 0.64\%  greater than those on day 0. Thus, fluoxastrobin was relatively stable in an  aquatic environment. In addition, the present study provided more information  regarding the toxic effects of fluoxastrobin and the scientific methods for  selection and evaluation of fungicides in the future.},

Afterwards, the mRNA transcription levels  of BNDF and c-fos genes and the protein levels were measured by qRT-PCR and  Western blotting, respectively.

Here, zebrafish larvae were exposed, from 1.5 to 120 h  post-fertilization, to a broad concentration range (0.05-10.000 μg/L) of  glyphosate to explore its impact on the brain. We evaluated morphology, tracked  locomotor behavior and neurophysiological parameters, examined  neuro-glio-vascular cell structures, and outlined transcriptomic outcomes by RNA  sequencing. At the concentration range tested, glyphosate did not elicit gross  morphological changes. Behavioral analysis revealed a significant decrease in  locomotor activity following the exposure to 1000 μg/L glyphosate or higher. In  parallel, midbrain electrophysiological recordings indicated abnormal, and  variable, spike activity in zebrafish larvae exposed to 1000 μg/L glyphosate.  Next, we asked whether the observed neurophysiological outcome could be secondary  to brain structural modifications. We used transgenic zebrafish and in vivo  2-photon microscopy to examine, at the cellular level, the effects of the  behavior-modifying concentration of 1000 μg/L, comparing to low 0.1 μg/L, and  control. We ruled out the presence of cerebrovascular and neuronal malformations.  However, microglia morphological modifications were visible at the two glyphosate  concentrations, specifically the presence of amoeboid cells suggestive of  activation. Lastly, RNAseq analysis showed the deregulation of transcript  families implicated in neuronal physiology, synaptic transmission, and  inflammation, as evaluated at the two selected glyphosate concentrations. In  zebrafish larvae, behavioral and neurophysiological defects occur after the  exposure to high glyphosate concentrations while cellular and transcript  signatures can be detected in response to low dose. The prospective applicability  to ecotoxicology and the possible extension to brain-health vulnerability are  critically discussed.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative toxicity of  tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using multiple-level endpoints such  as behavioral endpoints and enzymatic and molecular biomarkers associated with  their mode of action. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoles at environmentally  relevant and high concentrations, 0.3, 1.0, and 1000 µg/L, starting at 5 h  postfertilization (hpf) up to 48 hpf, as well as 5 d postfertilization (dpf).  Relative mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 family 51  lanosterol-14α-demethylase, glutathione S-transferase, caspase 9, phosphoprotein  p53, and BCL2-associated X protein were measured to assess toxicity attributable  to fungicides at the mRNA level, whereas caspase 3/7 (apoptosis) and  3,4-methylene​dioxy​amphetamine (lipid peroxidation) levels were measured at the  enzymatic level. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was measure through the  Mito Stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 at 48 hpf. In addition, light to dark  movement behavior was monitored at 5 dpf using Danio Vision® to understand  adverse effects at the organismal level. There was no significant difference in  the light to dark behavior with exposure to azoles compared to controls. The  molecular biomarkers indicated that propiconazole and myclobutanil induced lipid  peroxidation, oxidative stress, and potentially apoptosis at environmentally  relevant concentrations (0.3 and 1 µg/L). The results from the mitochondrial  respiration assay indicated a slight decrease in spare respiratory capacity with  an acute exposure (48 hpf) to all 3 azoles at 1000 µg/L. Based on the present  results, propiconazole and myclobutanil are acutely toxic compared to  tebuconazole in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Its acute toxic effects on zebrafish and freshwater algae have been  reported in our previous studies. To further investigate its chronic toxic  effects to aquatic organisms, adult zebrafish were exposed for 28 days to a  series of environmentally relevant boscalid concentrations in this study. Growth  indicators and histopathology were determined in this study. Results indicated  that boscalid inhibited the growth of zebrafish and induced damage in the kidneys  and liver. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as the key pathways of energy  metabolism in growth of zebrafish were also investigated. Results showed boscalid  caused an increase in the activity of hexokinase (HK), the content of glycogen,  glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and insulin (INS) in liver and a decrease in  blood glucose content and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Boscalid  reduced the total content of triacylglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (TC) and the  activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in  the liver. Correspondingly, expression of the genes related to carbohydrate and  lipid metabolism in liver and intestine was affected by boscalid, especially in  the significant upregulation of G6Pase and pparα and downregulation of SGLT-1 and  AMY. Results suggested that boscalid could affect carbohydrate metabolism of  adult zebrafish via regulation of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis at 0.1 mg/L.  Moreover, boscalid might induce an increase in β-oxidation and a decrease in  lipid synthesis at 0.01 mg/L. In conclusion, our study identified that  carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are the possible biological pathways that  mediate boscalid-induced developmental effects.},

Early life stages were exposed to five different concentrations (thiacloprid: 1,  5, 10, 15 and 20mg/L; diazinon: 100, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 microg/L) for 72 or  96 h, respectively, depending on the temperature. Thiacloprid was shown to have  no effects on early life stage parameters, except on the heart rate. This effect  was probably due to an increased metabolism upon exposure to the pollutant.  Exposure to diazinon resulted in mortality which strongly increased with elevated  temperature. Within the tested temperature range, increased mortality occurred  particularly at concentrations of 2000 and 3000 microg/L diazinon. Observed  sublethal effects were a decrease of the heart rate with increasing substance  concentration, yolk sac edema, heart sac edema and spine deformations,  particularly at concentrations of 2000 and 3000 microg/L diazinon. The hatching  date was shown to be preponed with increasing temperature, most strikingly in  combination with 2000 or 3000 microg/L diazinon.

Previous data indicated that it acts as a developmental  neurotoxicant and can induce transgenerational effects in non-target organisms.  However, associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study  was to investigate permethrin-related transgenerational effects in the zebrafish  model, and to identify possible molecular mechanisms underlying inheritance.  Zebrafish (F0) were exposed to permethrin during early-life (2 h  post-fertilization up to 28 days). The F1 and F2 offspring generations were  obtained by pairing exposed F0 males and females, and were bred unexposed.  Locomotor and anxiety behavior were investigated, together with transcriptomic  and epigenomic (DNA methylation) changes in brains. Permethrin exposed F0 fish  were hypoactive at adulthood, while males from the F1 and F2 generations showed a  specific decrease in anxiety-like behavior. In F0, transcriptomic data showed  enrichment in pathways related to glutamatergic synapse activity, which may  partly underlie the behavioral effects. In F1 and F2 males, dysregulation of  similar pathways was observed, including a subset of differentially methylated  regions that were inherited from the F0 to the F2 generation and indicated stable  dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling. Altogether, the present results provide  novel evidence on the transgenerational neurotoxic effects of permethrin, as well  as mechanistic insight: a transient exposure induces persistent transcriptional  and DNA methylation changes that may translate into transgenerational alteration  of glutamatergic signaling and, thus, into behavioral alterations.},

To address  this knowledge gap, we conducted zebrafish embryo toxicity tests to assess  deformities, survival, and sub-lethal responses following exposure to zoxamide  (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 μM zoxamide). We hypothesized that skeletal  deformities would be prevalent in zebrafish due to its mechanism of inhibiting  beta-tubulin polymerization. Zoxamide was relatively toxic to zebrafish embryos  and larvae, and survival was reduced ∼50 \% at 2 days post fertilization (dpf)  with 10 μM exposure and over time at 6 dpf, 2.5 μM exposure reduced survival by  ∼20 \%. Frequency of hatch was also reduced/delayed in zebrafish at 3 dpf with  {\textgreater}2.5 μM zoxamide. Pericardial edema, body length shortening, and spine curvature  were observed in larvae exposed to {\textgreater}5 μM. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were  assessed in ∼30 hpf embryos (24-hour exposure) using an XFe24 Flux Analyzer and  regression analysis revealed a negative relationship between basal respiration  and zoxamide concentration. Superoxide dismutase 1 and caspase 3 mRNA levels were  both decreased in 6 dpf larvae exposed to 2.5 μM zoxamide, but were not changed  in expression at 0.5 nor 1 μM zoxamide. Continuous 6-day exposure to zoxamide  reduced larval activity at 2.5 μM; conversely a 24-hour exposure (at 5-6 dpf)  induced hyperactivity at 5 μM suggesting dose and time dependent effects on fish  behavior. Based on sub-lethal endpoints, we conceptualize an adverse outcome  pathway for chemicals that inhibit tubulin polymerization.},

The  acute toxicity test results showed that the median lethal concentration (LC(50))  value of spirotetramat were 9.61 mg/L and 7.21 mg/L at 72 h and 96 h,  respectively, suggesting spirotetramat has moderate toxicity to zebrafish. In the  following sub-lethal toxicity test, the gene expression of superoxide dismutase  (SOD), catalase (CAT), and gonadotropic hormone receptor (FSHR and LHR) together  with the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in ovary were measured at 14, 21, and  28 days after exposure to 36, 360 and 720 μg/L. Under high concentration  treatment (360 and 720 μg/L), MDA content, the relative transcription CAT and SOD  gene level increased significantly in ovary (p {\textless} 0.05). That indicated sub-lethal  doses spirotetramat caused oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in zebrafish  ovary during the entire experimental period. Under the exposure to spirotetramat  at 720 μg/L after 14 days, the relative transcript FSHR gene level was down  regulated, and the relative transcript LHR gene level was up regulated. Moreover,  spirotetramat affected the oocyte development especially on the diameter size and  maturation during the ovary tissue biopsies at 28 days.

	abstract = {Triadimefon (TDF) is a pesticide used in agricultural crops to control powdery mildews, rusts and other fungal pests. It exerts its fungicidal activity through  the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, impairing the formation of the cell  membrane. For vertebrates, one of its side effects is the binding to the dopamine  transporter increasing the levels of synaptic dopamine, similarly to cocaine. In  addition, it has been demonstrated that TDF affects the abundance of other  monoamines in the brain, specifically serotonin. It is well known that drugs  which alter the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems produce behavioral changes  and participate in the development of addictions in mammals. In this work we have  used the conditioned place preference paradigm to assess, for the first time, the  rewarding properties of TDF in zebrafish. We found out that TDF triggers both,  preference and aversion depending on the dosage used during conditioning. We  observed that 5 mg/L produced aversion to the pattern previously paired with TDF.  However, 15 mg/L induced the opposite behavior, showing that zebrafish seek out  those environments which had previously been paired with the higher dose of TDF.  These results are congruent with our previous findings, where we showed that  5 mg/L reduced the levels of serotonin, usually linked to anxious behaviors (a  negative cue), whereas higher concentrations of TDF increased extracellular  dopamine, the main currency of the reward system. Interestingly, both doses of  TDF induced circling behavior, a feature usually seen in glutamatergic  antagonists.},

	abstract = {Aquatic herbicides are used worldwide to eradicate nuisance and invasive plants despite limited knowledge of their toxicity to non-target organisms.  2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a common active ingredient in  commercial herbicide formulations, which triggers plant cell death by mimicking  the plant-specific hormone auxin. Application practices of 2,4-D commercial  herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This  practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full  impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it  may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem  dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio  rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing  commercial herbicide DMA4(®)IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival,  behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt  morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed  reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm  pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced  in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and  yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4  exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of  visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish  exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum  following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the  development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and  thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.},

	abstract = {Herbicides and their metabolites are often detected in water bodies where they may cause adverse effects to non-target organisms. Their effects at  environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning  mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the  most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic  acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of  zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual  substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours  post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as  malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements,  heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to  the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial  metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway  were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 μg/L) and the pesticide mixture  (1 μg/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of  21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in  larvae exposed to more than 100 μg/L of individual substances (craniofacial  deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 μg/L of  each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on  hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found.  Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53  gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance;  MESA 30 μg/L; and MOA 100 μg/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome  P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the  thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the  environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 μg/L of each  substance) and MESA metabolite (1 μg/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was  revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental  malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced  spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the thyroid system disruption represents a  likely hypothesis behind the effects caused by the low environmental  concentrations of S-metolachlor, its two metabolites and their mixture.},

Optimum mitochondrial function is critical during embryonic development, as they play a  key role in early signaling cascades and epigenetic programming, in addition to  sustaining an adequate energy production. Mitochondria are sensitive targets of  environmental toxins, potentially even at levels considered safe under current  regulatory limits. Most mitochondrial analyses have focused only on chemical  exposure effects in vitro or in isolated mitochondria. However, comparatively  little is known about mitochondrial effects of chemical exposure during  vertebrate embryogenesis, especially during the recovery phase following a  chemical insult. Here, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio), in a 96-well plate  system, to examine mitochondrial effects of 24 chemicals including  pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and agrochemicals. We used oxygen  consumption rate (OCR) during embryogenesis as a proxy for mitochondrial  function. Embryonic OCR (eOCR) was measured in clean egg water immediately  following 24 h of chemical exposure and subsequently for an additional 8 h. Each  chemical, dependent upon the concentration, resulted in a unique eOCR response  profile. While some eOCR effects were persistent or recoverable over time, some  effects were only detected several hours after being removed from the exposure.  Non-monotonic dose response effects as well as mitochondrial hormesis were also  detected following exposure to some chemicals. Collectively, our study shows that  mitochondrial response to chemicals are highly dynamic and warrant careful  consideration when determining mitochondrial toxicity of a given chemical.},

	abstract = {Pesticides are typically applied to crops as acute applications, and residual effects of such intermittent exposures are not often characterized in developing  fish. Fipronil is an agricultural pesticide that inhibits γ-amino-butyric acid  (GABA) gated chloride channels. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  were exposed for 48 h (starting at {\textasciitilde}3 h post fertilization, hpf) to various  concentrations of fipronil (0.02 μg/L up to 4000 μg/L). Following this acute  exposure, a subset of fish was transferred to clean water for a 7-day depuration  phase. We hypothesized that a pulse exposure to fipronil during critical periods  of central nervous system development would adversely affect fish later in life.  After a 48 hour pulse exposure, survival was reduced in embryos exposed to 2 μg  fipronil/L or greater. However, there was no further mortality during the  depuration phase, nor were there changes in body length nor notochord length in  larvae 9 dpf (days post-fertilization) compared to controls. Additional  experiments were carried out at higher concentrations over 96 h (up to 4 dpf) to  also elucidate developmental effects and teratogenicity of fipronil (43.7 μg/L up  to 4370 μg/L). Fipronil at these higher concentrations significantly impacted the  development of zebrafish, and the following morphometric and teratogenic effects  were observed in 4 dpf fish; reduced body length, yolk sac and pericardial edema,  reduced midbrain length, reduced optic and otic diameter, and truncation of the  lower jaw. In depurated fish, we hypothesized that there would exist residual  effects of exposure at the molecular level. Transcriptome profiling was therefore  conducted on 9 dpf depurated larvae exposed initially for 48 h to one dose of  either 0.2 μg/L, 200 μg/L or 2000 μg/L fipronil. The expression of gene networks  associated with glycogen and omega-3-fatty acid metabolism were decreased in  larvae exposed to each of the three concentrations of fipronil, suggesting  metabolic disruption. Moreover, transcriptomics revealed that fipronil suppressed  gene networks related to light-dark adaptation, photoperiod sensing, and  circadian rhythm. Based on these data, we tested fish for altered behavioral  responses in a Light-Dark preference test. Larvae exposed to {\textgreater}200 μg fipronil/L  as embryos showed fewer number of visits (20-30\% less) to the dark zone compared  to controls. Larvae also spent a lower amount of time in the dark zone compared  to controls, suggesting that fipronil strengthened dark avoidance behavior which  is indicative of anxiety. This study demonstrates that a short pulse exposure to  fipronil can affect transcriptome networks for metabolism, circadian rhythm, and  response to light in fish after depuration, and these molecular responses are  hypothesized to be related to aberrant behavioral effects observed in the  light-dark preference test.},

	abstract = {A diverse range of chemicals are used in agriculture to increase food production on a large scale, and among them is the use of pesticides such as chlorothalonil,  a broad-spectrum fungicide used in the control of foliar fungal diseases. This  study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers  of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals  were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0  μg/L (DMSO, 0.001\%), 0.1 μg/L and 10 μg/L, and after the exposure period, the  tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant  capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the  concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and  lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS  concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of  LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4  days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as  well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to  the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a  significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a  significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These  results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the  antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest  concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound  caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills  were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in  chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be  exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to  the metabolism taking place in the gills.},

	abstract = {Toxaphene, also known as camphechlor, is a persistent organochlorine pesticide of complex composition. It is technically produced by photochlorination of camphene  with elemental chlorine gas under ultraviolet irradiation. In the present work, a  novel, laboratory-scale synthesis using sulfuryl chloride as a chlorinating  reagent is described. This approach allowed the degree of chlorination of the  resulting mixtures to be arbitrarily adjusted by varying the reaction conditions.  Both the compositions and the chlorine contents of the low- and high-chlorinated  mixtures acquired using this method were similar to those of environmentally  altered toxaphene and technical toxaphene, respectively. For comparison of these  mixtures regarding toxicity, they were subjected to the zebrafish (Danio rerio)  embryo test. Median effective concentrations (EC50s) were calculated based on the  presence of lethal and nonlethal embryonic malformations. Surprisingly,  low-chlorinated toxaphene, comprising compounds that also are present in  environmentally transformed toxaphene, exhibited a twofold-higher toxicity  (according to the EC50 for nonlethal effects) toward the test organisms compared  with high-chlorinated toxaphene, the composition of which resembled that of the  technical product. Although the effective concentrations in the embryo test were  much higher than those in aquatic ecosystems burdened with toxaphene, the present  results lead to the assumption that toxaphene is becoming more toxic during  transformation in the environment. A decrease in the total amount of toxaphene  during environmental breakdown would then be compensated for, at least in part,  by the higher toxicity of weathered toxaphene in sediments, soils, and biota of  contaminated ecosystems.},

In this study, zebrafish were separately exposed to 100 and  1000 μgL(-1) hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers for 21 d (1)H NMR-based  metabolomics analysis showed that the exposure of low and high dose of  hexaconazole enantiomers altered energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino  acid metabolism of zebrafish, with the different metabolic profiles resulted from  the same dose of (+)-hexaconazole and (-)-hexaconazole. Similar to hexaconazole  enantiomers, the metabolic profiles, including the changes related to energy  metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, were demonstrated in low  and high dose epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups. There are differences  in the metabolic profiles of zebrafish between exposed to (+)-epoxiconazole and  (-)-epoxiconazole of the same dose. The results of histological examination  revealed that the exposure of both enantiomers for hexaconazole and epoxiconazole  resulted in the similar histopathological changes. The exposure of hexaconazole  and epoxiconazole enantiomers at low and high dose resulted the vacuolization and  swell in the liver of the female and male zebrafish. Compared to female  zebrafish, more liver damage was found in male zebrafish in the hexaconazole  enantiomers exposure groups. The reduction of spermatids was observed in  hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups of both doses.  Hexaconazole enantiomers exposure of low and high dose resulted the increase in  the number of mature eggs, while such effect was not observed in epoxiconazole  enantiomers exposure groups. Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure  resulted in no changes in brains of female and male zebrafish. As a result, both  triazole-based chiral bactericides, hexaconazole and epoxiconazole, have similar  toxicological effects but their mechanisms of action are not exactly the same.  The above results will play an important part in making the differences in toxic  effects of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers clear.

	abstract = {Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended  to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult  fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to  sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and  then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of  behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor  activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding.  Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl  produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included  decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of  medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial  pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity  in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall,  this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating  long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data  supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations.  Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption  responsible for the effects observed.},

Moreover,  zebrafish ELS test have been proposed, mainly for ethical reasons, as a surrogate  for tests with adults. In this work, the fungicide Prochloraz (PCZ) was used as a  chemical model to compare sensitivities of embryos/larvae and adult zebrafish  focusing on lethality and biomarkers as endpoints. Effects on embryo development  were also assessed. Organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD)  guidelines were followed and adapted to include the analyses of the biomarkers  cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The acute  toxicity of PCZ for zebrafish ELS and adults seemed to be similar with 96 h-LC₅₀  values of 8.5 and 4.6 mg/L, respectively. However, biomarkers were only  responsive in larvae indicating a higher sensitivity of this life stage at  sublethal level. PCZ also proved to be teratogenic: at intermediate  concentrations effects on embryo development could be noticed, including spine  deformations, edemas, lack of pigmentation, slower heart rate, and complete  hatching failure. At the lowest concentrations, the more relevant effects (edemas  and abnormal absorption of the yolk sac) were observed after hatching. The  measurement of biomarkers in the zebrafish ELS assay seems to a useful tool in  the detection of chemical effects showing higher sensitivity than adults. Further  research should focus on the link between biomarkers responses in larvae and  effects at later life stages of zebrafish.},

Animal exposure to 2,4-D increased cytochrome c  oxidase and catalase activities and reduced SOD/CAT ratio, moreover, increased  the total distance traveled and the number of crossings.

A method based on hydrophilic  interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has been  applied for the first time to zebrafish embryos and larvae to study five  neurotransmitter systems in parallel, including the dopaminergic-andrenergic,  glutaminergic-GABAnergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic systems.  Our method enables the quantification of neurotransmitters and their precursors  and metabolites in whole zebrafish from the period of zygote to free-swimming  larvae 6 days postfertilization (dpf). We observed a developmental  stage-dependent pattern with clear differences between the first 2 days of  development and the following days. Whereas the neurotransmitter levels steadily  increased, the precursors showed a peak at 3 dpf. After exposure to several  pesticides, significant differences in concentrations of neurotransmitters and  precursors were observed.

Molecules of glyphosate have been  found in water bodies around the world, and its presence can cause negative  effects on non-target organisms, such as fish. Glyphosate toxicity appears to be  systemic in fish but does not affect their organs equally. Also, its formulations  can be more toxic than pure glyphosate. In this sense, we investigated if these  variations in toxicity could be related to ATP binding cassette subfamily C  (ABCC) transporters and the cellular detoxification capacity, following exposure  to herbicides. Thus, adults of Danio rerio were exposed (24 and 96 h) to  glyphosate and Roundup Transorb® (RT) at an environmental concentration of  0.1 mg/L, and the activity of ABCC proteins and gene expression of five isoforms  of ABCC were analyzed. Glyphosate and RT exposure increased ABCC protein activity  and gene expression up to 3-fold when compared to controls, indicating the  activation of detoxification mechanisms. Only in the brain of D. rerio, the  exposure to RT did not stimulate the activity of ABCC proteins, neither the  expression of genes abcc1 and abcc4 that responded to the exposure to pure  glyphosate. These results may suggest that the brain is more sensitive to RT than  the other target-tissues since the mechanism of detoxification via ABCC  transporters were not activated in this tissue as it was in the other.},

	abstract = {Global use of azole fungicides is expected to increase over the next several years. Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that is used for turf protection,  residential, and other commercial applications. As such, it can enter local rural  and urban water systems via run-off and rain events. Early life stages of aquatic  organisms can be susceptible to pesticides that enter the water, but in the case  of triticonazole, data on the potential for subacute toxicity are lacking. Here,  we determined the effects of triticonazole on development, oxygen consumption  rates, and locomotor activity in zebrafish to address this knowledge gap.  Wild-type zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to  triticonazole (1-100 μM) in early development for different lengths of time  depending on the assay conducted. Triticonazole did not affect survival nor  induce significant deformity (pericardial edema, skeletal defects) in zebrafish  at doses up to 100 μM. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in embryos after 24  and 48 hour exposure to triticonazole beginning at ∼6 hpf using the XF(e) flux  analyzer. Triticonazole did not affect basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP  linked respiration, FCCP-induced maximum respiration, proton leak, spare  capacity, nor non-mitochondrial respiration at doses up to 100 μM for 24 hours,  even for exposure up to 250 μM for 48 hours. To determine whether the fungicide  affected larval swimming activity, the visual motor response test was conducted  following triticonazole exposure for 6 days. Larval zebrafish exposed to  triticonazole showed hypoactivity in the dark following a 100 μM treatment,  suggesting that the fungicide can affect the locomotor activity of zebrafish,  albeit at relatively high levels. Given the fact that sublethal biological  responses were absent at lower environmentally relevant concentrations, we  conclude that triticonazole, relative to other triazole fungicides and types of  pesticides, exhibits a relatively low risk of toxicity to the early life stages  of fish.},

The increased use of pyrethroid leads to potential adverse effects,  particularly in sensitive populations such as children and pregnant women. None  of the related studies was focused on the transcriptome responses in zebrafish  embryos after treatment with DTM; therefore, RNA-seq, a high-throughput method,  was performed to analyze the global expression of differential expressed genes  (DEGs) in zebrafish embryos treated with DTM (40 and 80 μg/L) from fertilization  to 48 h postfertilization (hpf) as compared with that in the control group  (without DTM treatment). Two cDNA libraries were generated from treated embryos  and one cDNA library from nontreated embryos, respectively. Over 92\% of reads  mapped to the reference in these three libraries. It was observed that many  differential genes were expressed in comparison with embryos before and after  DTM. The 20 most differentially expressed upregulated or downregulated genes were  majorly involved in the signaling transduction. Validation of selected nine genes  expression using qRT-PCR confirmed RNA-seq results. The transcriptome sequences  were further subjected to gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and  Genomes (KEGG) analysis, showing G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and  neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, respectively, were most enriched.

In the present study,  zebrafish larvae (7 days post-fertilization) were exposed to a series  concentration of acetochlor (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 µg l(-1) ) within a  14-day window until 21 days post-fertilization. Thyroid hormones and mRNA  expression profiles of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT)  axis were analyzed. Exposure to the positive control, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3  ), altered the mRNA expression, suggesting that the HPT axis in the critical  window of zebrafish responded to chemical exposure and could be used to evaluate  the effects of chemicals on the thyroid endocrine system. The mRNA expressions of  genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (tshβ, slc5a5 and tpo) were  upregulated significantly with acetochlor treatment, which might be responsible  for the increased thyroxine concentrations. The downregulation of genes related  to thyroid hormone metabolism (dio1 and ugt1ab) and transport (ttr) in zebrafish  larvae exposed to acetochlor might further explain the increased thyroxine levels  and decreased T3 levels. The mRNA expression of the thyroid hormone receptor  (trα) was also upregulated upon acetochlor exposure. Results suggested that  acetochlor altered mRNA expression of the HPT axis-related genes and changed the  whole body thyroid hormone levels in zebrafish larvae. It demonstrated that  acetochlor could cause endocrine disruption of the thyroid system by simulating  the biological activity of T3 . Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used throughout the world in agriculture, forestry, horticulture and homes. Though the neurotoxicity  of cypermethrin has been thoroughly studied in adult rodents, little is so far  available regarding the developmental toxicity of cypermethrin to fish in early  life stages. To explore the potential developmental toxicity of cypermethrin, 4-h  post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations  of cypermethrin (0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg L⁻¹) until 96 h. Among a suite of  morphological abnormalities, the unique phenotype curvature was observed at  concentrations as low as 25 μg L⁻¹. Studies revealed that 400 μg L⁻¹ cypermethrin  significantly increased malondialdehyde production. In addition, activity of  antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase were  significantly induced in zebrafish larvae in a concentration-dependent manner. To  further investigate the toxic effects of cypermethrin on fish, acridine orange  (AO) staining was performed at 400 μg L⁻¹ cypermethrin and the result showed  notable signs of apoptosis mainly in the nervous system. Cypermethrin also  down-regulated ogg1 and increased p53 gene expression as well as the caspase-3  activity. Our results demonstrate that cypermethrin was able to induce oxidative  stress and produce apoptosis through the involvement of caspases in zebrafish  embryos. In this study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of  cypermethrin using zebrafish embryos, which could be helpful in fully  understanding the potential mechanisms of cypermethrin exposure during  embryogenesis and also suggested that zebrafish could serve as an ideal model for  studying developmental toxicity of environmental contaminants.},

The DNA  integrity of sperm was not affected. The levels of expression of genes related to  spermatogenesis, antioxidant defenses, and DNA repair were also investigated  using RT-qPCR. The ATZ caused transcriptional repression of the  spermatogenesis-related genes SRD5A2 and CFTR, the antioxidant defense genes SOD2  and GPX4B, and the DNA repair gene XPC. This is the first study to show that  environmentally relevant concentrations of ATZ significantly affect the sperm  quality in fish, possibly resulting in reduced fertility rates. In addition, we  showed that the repression of genes related to spermatogenesis and cellular  defense could be part of the mechanisms involved in the ATZ toxicity in the  testes of male fish.},

Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter  phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be  isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via  non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine  exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time,  latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain  mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b,  htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed  to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile  development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect  of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal  exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy  for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in  unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared  to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context  of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate  positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship  was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine  exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed  signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational  effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on  behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.},

Developmental abnormalities, including edema, small head deformity,  body deformation and decreased pigmentation, and mortality were observed in  zebrafish embryos of 0.05 mg/L and higher concentrations, which shown  concentration dependency. The heart rate of zebrafish was disrupted by IPZ.  Moreover, enzyme and gene experiments shown that IPZ exposure caused oxidative  stress of zebrafish. Furthermore, it induced a decrease of succinate  dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme activity and gene transcription level in zebrafish  larvae. It can be speculated that IPZ may have a lethal effect on zebrafish,  which is accompanied by decreased SDH activity, oxidative stress, and  abnormality.

Due to their wide use and the  repeated application, fungicides can be found at a much greater concentration  than other agrochemicals in all environmental compartments. One of these  fungicides, tebuconazole (TBZ), has been recognized as an endocrine-disrupting  chemical, and the available literature focuses mainly on this mechanism of  action. In the present study by subjecting the zebrafish model to an  environmentally realistic concentration of TBZ, we clearly demonstrate that this  fungicide has the potential to induce severe morphological and ultrastructural  alterations in gills. The main morphological effects recorded in this study were  as follows: the proliferation of the main epithelium, ectopia of chloride cells,  lamellar shortening, necrosis, and apoptosis. TBZ exposure also resulted in the  overtime decrease in the expression of both Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and aquaporin 3 and  in the induction of oxidative stress enzyme (superoxide dismutase-1) as revealed  by immunohistochemical analysis. Our results clearly indicate that respiratory  and osmoregulatory disorders represent an important mechanism of TBZ toxicity on  Danio rerio gills.

It was heavily used as a pesticide for agricultural purposes in the  1960-1970s, but despite being banned {\textgreater}30 years ago, it can remain elevated in the  soil due to its resistance to metabolic degradation; this has led to longstanding  concerns about elevated levels of toxaphene and other organochlorine pesticides  (OCPs) in the environment. The objective of this study were to determine the  effects of waterborne exposure to toxaphene on early life stages of zebrafish.  Based on the LC(50), zebrafish embryos were exposed to control (embryo rearing  media or DMSO) or to one dose of toxaphene ranging between 0.011 and 111.1 μg/mL  from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) up to 120 hpf. Significant mortality and hatch  time delays were observed in embryos exposed to toxaphene (at or above 0.11 and  1.11 μg/mL, depending on the assay). Higher prevalence of deformities was noted  at higher doses (≥0.011 μg/mL), and these included pericardial edema and skeletal  deformities. As energy production is important for normal development,  mitochondrial bioenergetics were assessed in embryos following toxaphene  exposure. Embryos exposed to 11.1 or 111 μg/mL toxaphene for 24 h showed lower  non-mitochondrial respiration ({\textasciitilde}30\%) compared to both solvent and no treatment  controls. Expression of transcripts related to oxidative damage responses and  apoptosis were measured and heat shock protein 70 was significantly increased  with 111 μg/mL toxaphene (14.5 fold), while the expression levels of caspase 3,  caspase 9, and superoxide dismutase 1 were not changed. These data demonstrate  that developmental deformities induced by toxaphene include pericardial edema and  skeletal deformity, and that toxaphene can affect oxidative phosphorylation in  early staged zebrafish.},

Fish treated with ≥1 µM atrazine also developed with delayed vertebrae  mineralization. Higher concentrations of atrazine caused gross craniofacial  defects and decreased hatching rates.

We investigated the sensitivity of  different life stages of zebrafish toward toxic and estrogenic properties of  methoxychlor (MXC). Short-term tests with adults resulted in a sex-specific 96-h  lethal concentration for 50\% (LC50) of the test animals of 36 microg/L for males  and 129 microg/L for females. To determine the estrogenic capacity of MXC, adult  zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.5, 5, and 50 microg MXC/L for 14 d. Induction of  vitellogenin ([VTG] measured with protein electrophoresis and Western blot) in  males was detected at 5 and 50 microg MXC/L. Females, however, did not exhibit  higher blood VTG concentrations at the tested MXC concentrations. In a second  series of experiments, juvenile zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 5  microg MXC/L for 33 d. Survival, length, weight, and condition of larvae were  examined as indicators of toxic stress and the VTG content in whole body  homogenates of juveniles was measured to determine xenoestrogenic effects. No  effects of the tested concentrations of MXC were observed. Finally, the effect of  MXC on zebrafish eggs, exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 32 microg MXC/L, was examined.  Hatching and survival of hatched zebrafish were affected at 10 and 32 microg  MXC/L. This study demonstrated that adult male zebrafish are sensitive toward the  estrogenic effects of MXC. However, the use of VTG induction to detect effects of  (xeno)estrogens in early life stages has to be further investigated, as low  concentrations of VTG were detectable in exposed as well as unexposed juvenile  fish.},

	abstract = {Atrazine is an agricultural herbicide used throughout the Midwestern United States that frequently contaminates potable water supplies resulting in human  exposure. Using the zebrafish model system, an embryonic atrazine exposure was  previously reported to decrease spawning rates with an increase in progesterone  and ovarian follicular atresia in adult females. In addition, alterations in  genes associated with distinct molecular pathways of the endocrine system were  observed in brain and gonad tissue of the adult females and males. Current  hypotheses for mechanistic changes in the developmental origins of health and  disease include genetic (e.g., copy number alterations) or epigenetic (e.g., DNA  methylation) mechanisms. As such, in the current study we investigated whether an  atrazine exposure would generate copy number alterations (CNAs) in the zebrafish  genome. A zebrafish fibroblast cell line was used to limit detection to CNAs  caused by the chemical exposure. First, cells were exposed to a range of atrazine  concentrations and a crystal violet assay was completed, showing confluency  decreased by {\textasciitilde}60\% at 46.3μM. Cells were then exposed to 0, 0.463, 4.63, or 46.3μM  atrazine and array comparative genomic hybridization completed. Results showed  34, 21, and 44 CNAs in the 0.463, 4.63, and 46.3μM treatments, respectively.  Furthermore, CNAs were associated with previously reported gene expression  alterations in adult male and female zebrafish. This study demonstrates that  atrazine exposure can generate CNAs that are linked to gene expression  alterations observed in adult zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis  providing a mechanism of the developmental origins of atrazine endocrine  disruption.},

	abstract = {Benomyl is a benzimidazole fungicide that has been widely used on a variety of food crops and ornamental plants. It is known to cause adverse effects on  reproductive systems, including decreased testicular and epididymal weights and  reduced epididymal sperm counts and fertility. The brain aromatase gene is  up-regulated by estrogens and estrogen mimics and considered a target gene to  screen estrogen mimics. This study was designed to test the estrogenic potential  and toxic effects of benomyl in the zebrafish system, and validated this system  as a model that may correspond to the effect of benomyl in rodents.  Concentrations of 20 x 10(-6), 40 x 10(-6) and 80 x 10(-6) M of benomyl-treated  embryos showed decreased survival, hatching and heart rates, and increased  incidence of malformations, such as pericardial edema, spinal lordosis, elongated  heart, head edema, eye lens protrusion and caudal fin disappearance. Benomyl  induced enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in the mediobasal  hypothalamus (MBH) in transient zebrafish embryos with a brain aromatase-based  reporter gene. In this study, we determined that benomyl has estrogenic potential  based on zebrafish brain aromatase gene induction, and that benomyl is toxic at  20 x 10(-6) M concentration and higher. These results demonstrate the usefulness  of zebrafish embryos as an in vivo system to examine the estrogenic and  developmental toxic potential of unknown compounds.},

Expressional pattern of the GST isoforms in adult fish  has been used as a biomarker of exposure to environmental chemicals. However, GST  transcriptional responses vary across organs, thus requiring a cross-tissue  examination of multiple mRNAs for GST profiling in an animal after chemical  exposure. Zebrafish embryos express all GST isoforms as adult fish and could  therefore represent an alternative model for identification of biomarkers of  exposure. To evaluate such a possibility, we studied a set of cytosolic and  microsomal GST isoform-specific expression profiles in the zebrafish embryos  after exposure to atrazine, a widely used herbicide. Expression of the GST  isoforms was compared with that of CYP genes involved in the phase I of  xenobiotic metabolism and antioxidant enzyme (AOE) genes. Using quantitative  real-time PCR, we showed dynamic changes in the expressional pattern of twenty  GST isoforms, cyp1a, cyp3a65, ahr2, and four AOEs in early development of  zebrafish. Acute (48 and 72 h) exposure of 24 h-old embryos to atrazine, from  environmentally relevant (0.005 mg/L) to high (40 mg/L) concentrations, caused a  variety of transient, albeit minor changes ({\textless}2.5-fold) in the GST isoforms, ahr2  and AOE genes response. However, expression of cyp1a and cyp3a65 mRNA was  markedly and consistently induced by high doses of atrazine (5 and 40 mg/L). In  summary, an analysis of the response of multiple systems in the zebrafish embryos  provided a comprehensive understanding of atrazine toxicity and its potential  impact on biological processes.},

Studies have found that carbofuran posed potential risks for  the neurotransmitter systems of non-target species, we speculated that these  disruptive effects on the neurotransmitter systems could trigger anxiety-like  behaviors. In this study, female zebrafish were exposed to environmental levels  (5, 50, and 500 μg/L) of carbofuran for 48 h to evaluate the effects of  carbofuran on anxiety-like behaviors. Results showed that zebrafish exhibited  more anxiety-like behaviors which proved by the observed higher bottom trend and  more erratic movements in the novel tank after carbofuran treatment. In order to  elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of carbofuran-induced  anxiety-promoting effects, we measured the levels of neurotransmitters,  precursors, and major metabolites, along with the level of gene expression and  the enzyme activities involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. The  results demonstrated that acute carbofuran exposure stimulated the mRNA  expression and enzyme activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, which sequentially  induced the increased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Tyrosine hydroxylase  inhibitor relieved the anxiety-related changes induced by carbofuran, confirming  the overactive tyrosine hydroxylase-mediated accumulation of dopamine and  norepinephrine in the brain was one of the main reasons for carbofuran-induced  anxiety-like behaviors in the female zebrafish. Overall, our study indicated the  environmental health risks of carbamate pesticide in inducing neurobehavioral  disorders and provided novel insights into the investigation of the relevant  underlying mechanisms.},

The objective  of this study was to determine the effect of DLD on the hepatic proteome in  zebrafish following dietary treatment as the liver is central to metabolism.  Females were fed a control dose or one of three doses of DLD-contaminated food  pellets over 21 days. Both label-free and iTRAQ proteomics were conducted as two  complementary methods to expand coverage of the proteome. Label-free proteomics  quantified 1563 proteins: 6 proteins showed a linear dose-response with DLD.  iTRAQ quantified {\textgreater}3500 proteins; 5 proteins were decreased and 34 proteins were  increased in abundance within the liver with all three doses. Overall, DLD  reduced the abundance of proteins associated with glucose and cholesterol  metabolism, lipid oxidation, liver function, and immune-related processes. Few  proteins were identified by both methods as being altered ({\textasciitilde}1\%), suggesting that  each method detected different subsets of proteins. Protein responses in the  liver were largely dependent on dose, however proteins related to liver and organ  function, centrosome separation, glucose/energy metabolism, and immune-related  pathways were confirmed by each independent technique and were suppressed with  DLD exposure. This study identifies proteomic responses that are associated with  organochlorine-induced hepatotoxicity. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Environmental  contaminants cause hepatotoxicity because the liver is the major organ for  detoxification. The legacy pesticide dieldrin significantly bioaccumulates in  tissues, and can affect molecular processes that can lead to liver pathology. LC  MS/MS proteomics identified protein networks related to tumors, energy  homeostasis, and chromosomal separation as those affected by dietary exposure to  dieldrin. We applied two orthogonal mass spectrometry-based methods to more  completely survey the liver proteome, strengthening data interpretation. These  data improve understanding as to the effects of organochlorine pesticide toxicity  in the liver and the study identifies proteome networks that can contribute to  adverse outcome pathways for pesticide exposure.},

It is  considered to be a new candidate for the persistent organic pollutants group.  Endosulfan residues in the environment may cause serious damage to ecosystems,  especially in aquatic environments. The present study was conducted to  investigate the effect of endosulfan on antioxidant enzymes [catalase (CAT) and  superoxide dismutase (SOD)], reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA  damage in zebrafish. Male and female zebrafish were separated and exposed to a  control solution and four concentrations of endosulfan (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg  L⁻¹) and were sampled after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. It is noteworthy that the  present research explored the correlation among the three indicators induced by  endosulfan. Low endosulfan concentrations (0.01 μg L⁻¹) induced a slight increase  of SOD and CAT activity, which kept ROS in a stable level. High endosulfan  concentration (10 μg L⁻¹) induced excessive ROS production which exceeded the  capacity of the cellular antioxidants and exhausted the enzyme including CAT and  SOD. The DNA damage of zebrafish was evaluated by single-cell gel electrophoresis  and was enhanced with increasing endosulfan concentration. In conclusion, the  present study showed that endosulfan (0.01-10 μg L⁻¹) has toxic effects on  zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Bifenthrin (BF) is widely used as a miticide in orchards, nurseries and homes due to its great photostability and insecticidal activity. Recently, extensive  research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays.  However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF  to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were  evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and  96hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal  malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No  significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control  occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96h. The hatching  process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with  increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for  the test compound with 96-h EC(50) of 256microgL(-1) for pericardial edema, and  109microgL(-1) for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that  zebrafish larvae of 96hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to  50, 100, and 200microgL(-1) from 3 to 84hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free  embryo medium for one more day till 120hpf, larvae from the 50microgL(-1)group  seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour  compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were  exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse  transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were  significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150microgL(-1) BF for 72h,  indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed  that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after  short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the  individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their  ecological fitness.},

	abstract = {Cartap is a widely used insecticide which belongs to a member of nereistoxin derivatives and acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor site. Its effects on  aquatic species are of grave concern. To explore the potential developmental  toxicity of cartap, zebrafish embryos were continually exposed, from 0.5 to 144h  post-fertilization, to a range of concentrations of 25-1000microg/l. Results of  the experiment indicated that cartap concentrations of 100microg/l and above  negatively affected embryo survival and hatching success. Morphological analysis  uncovered a large suite of abnormalities such as less melanin pigmentation, wavy  notochord, crooked trunk, fuzzy somites, neurogenesis defects and vasculature  defects. The most sensitive organ was proved to be the notochord which displayed  defects at concentrations as low as 25microg/l. Both sensitivity towards exposure  and localization of the defect were stage specific. To elucidate mechanisms  concerning notochord, pigmentation, and hatching defects, enzyme assay, RT Q-PCR,  and different exposure strategies were performed. For embryos with hatching  failure, chorion was verified not to be digested, while removing cartap from  exposure at early pre-hatching stage could significantly increase the hatching  success. However, cartap was proved, via vitro assay, to have no effect on  proteolytic activity of hatching enzyme. These findings implied that the  secretion of hatching enzyme might be blocked. We also revealed that cartap  inhibited the activity of melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase and matrix enzyme lysyl  oxidase and induced expression of their genes. These suggested that cartap could  impaired melanin pigmentation of zebrafish embryos through inhibiting tyrosinase  activity, while inhibition of lysyl oxidase activity was responsible for  notochord undulation, which subsequently caused somite defect, and at least  partially responsible for defects in vasculature and neurogenesis.},

	abstract = {The dipyridyl herbicide paraquat induces oxidative stress in cells and is implicated in adult neurodegenerative diseases. However, less is known about  paraquat toxicity in early stages of vertebrate development. To address this gap,  zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 μM paraquat for  96 h. Paraquat did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in embryos and  larvae, but it did accelerate time to hatch. To evaluate whether mitochondrial  respiration was related to earlier hatch times, oxygen consumption rate was  measured in whole embryos. Maximal respiration of embryos exposed to 100 μM  paraquat for 24 h was reduced by more than 70\%, suggesting that paraquat  negatively impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics in early development. Based upon  this evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional responses of  oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes were measured. Fish exposed to 1 μM  paraquat showed higher expression levels of superoxide dismutase 2, heat shock  protein 70, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2a compared to  control fish. No differences among groups were detected in larvae exposed to 10  and 100 μM paraquat, suggesting a non-monotonic response. We also measured  endpoints related to larval behavior and dopaminergic signaling as paraquat is  associated with degeneration of dopamine neurons. Locomotor activity was  stimulated with 100 μM paraquat and dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor 3  mRNA levels were increased in larvae exposed to 1 μM paraquat, interpreted to be  a compensatory response at lower concentrations. This study improves mechanistic  understanding into the toxic actions of paraquat on early developmental stages.},

	abstract = {Carbendazim is a widely used broad spectrum benzimidazole fungicide; however, its effects to non-target aquatic organisms are poorly studied. The aim of this study  was to investigate the toxic effects of carbendazim to zebrafish early life  stages at several levels of biological organization, including developmental,  biochemical and behavioural levels. The embryo assay was done following the OECD  guideline 236 and using a concentration range between 1.1 and 1.8mg/L. Lethal and  developmental endpoints such as hatching, edemas, malformations, heart beat rate,  body growth and delays were assessed in a 96h exposure. A sub-teratogenic range  (from 0.16 to 500μg/L) was then used to assess effects at biochemical and  behavioural levels. Biochemical markers included cholinesterase (ChE),  glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT)  and were assessed at 96h. The locomotor behaviour was assessed using an automated  video tracking system at 120h. Carbendazim (96h-LC50 of 1.75mg/L) elicited  several developmental anomalies in zebrafish embryos with EC50 values ranging  from 0.85 to 1.6mg/L. ChE, GST and LDH activities were increased at  concentrations equal or above 4μg/L. The locomotor assay showed to be extremely  sensitive, detecting effects in time that larvae spent swimming at concentrations  of 0.16μg/L and thus, being several orders of magnitude more sensitive that  developmental parameters or lethality. These are ecological relevant  concentrations and highlight the potential of behavioural endpoints as early  warning signs for environmental stress. Further studies should focus on  understanding how the behavioural disturbances measured in these types of studies  translate into fitness impairment at the adult stage.},

	abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used insecticide, which has been shown to interfere with neurobehavioral development. Rat models have been key in  demonstrating that prenatal CPF exposure causes choice accuracy deficits and  motor alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary nonmammalian  models can be useful in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the  persisting behavioral effects of developmental CPF exposure. Zebrafish with their  clear chorion and extensive developmental information base provide an excellent  model for assessment of molecular processes of toxicant impacted  neurodevelopment. To facilitate the use of the zebrafish model and to compare it  to the more typical rodent models, the behavioral phenotype of CPF toxicity in  zebrafish must be well characterized. Our laboratory has developed methods for  assessing spatial discrimination learning in zebrafish, which can differentiate  response latency from choice accuracy in a three chambered fish tank. Low and  high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml on days 1-5 postfertilization) both had  significant persisting effects on both spatial discrimination and response  latency over 18 weeks of testing. The high, but not the low dose, significantly  accelerated mortality rates of the fish during the study from 20-38 weeks of age.  Developmental exposure to either 10 or 100 ng/ml of CPF caused significant  spatial discrimination impairments in zebrafish when they were adults. The  impairment caused by 10 ng/ml was seen during early but not later testing, while  the impairment caused by 100 ng/ml became more pronounced with continued testing.  The higher dose caused a more pervasive impairment. The 10 and 100 ng/ml doses  had opposite effects on response latency. The low 10 ng/ml dose significantly  slowed response latency, while the high 100 ng/ml dose significant increased  response latency. Both of these effects diminished with continued testing. CPF  exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments, which  lasted throughout adulthood in zebrafish. The molecular mechanisms by which early  developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral impairments expressed in  adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish model.},

Two cDNA libraries were generated from treated and  non-treated embryos, respectively. With the 79.4\% and 78.8\% of reads mapped to  the reference, it was observed that many differential genes were expressed  between the two libraries.

	abstract = {Encapsulation technology involves entrapping a chemical active ingredient (a.i.) inside a hollow polymeric shell and has been applied to commercial pesticide  manufacturing for years to produce capsule suspension (CS) formulations with  average particle sizes in the micron-scale. The few literature sources that  investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of  encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule  size report on average sizes between 20 and 50 μm. Here, we have identified a CS  formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2 μm with some capsules  extending into the nanometer scale ({\textasciitilde}200 nm). Determining how carrier size  influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk  assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate  encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with  lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a  fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules ({\textasciitilde}250 nm) and a fraction of  micron-sized capsules ({\textasciitilde}2200 nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule  size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h  after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of  pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality.  Fish exposed to greater than 20 μg a.i. L(-1) technical λ-Cy or formulated  product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial  malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro  fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences  in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i.  exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter  tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that  the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but  the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated  products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity  regardless of encapsulation technology.},

In the present study, to determine their  immunotoxic effects, zebrafish during the early developmental stage were exposed  to ATZ and its main metabolites at environmental concentrations (30, 100,  300 μg L(-1)). It was observed that ATZ, DACT, DIP and DE selectively induced the  transcription of immunotoxic related genes including Tnfα, Il-1β, Il-6, Il-8,  Cxcl-clc and Cc-chem in larval zebrafish. Pretreatment with ATZ and its  metabolites also changed the immune response of larval zebrafish to LPS and  E. coli challenge, which was indicated by the alternation in the mRNA levels of  some cytokines. In addition, 300 μg L(-1) ATZ and DACT exposure could also  increase the release of tryptase into water, indicating that they increased the  anaphylactoid reaction in the larval zebrafish. According to these results, both  of ATZ and its metabolites exposure could cause the immunotoxicity in larval  zebrafish. Thus, we thought that the ecological risks of the metabolites of ATZ  on aquatic organisms could not be ignored.},

	abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide designed to selectively inhibit insect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Although fipronil is often used in or  near aquatic environments, few studies have assessed the effects of this  neurotoxicant on aquatic vertebrates at sensitive life stages. We explored the  toxicological effects of fipronil on embryos and larvae using the zebrafish  (Danio rerio) experimental model system. Embryos exposed to fipronil at nominal  concentrations at or above 0.7 microM (333 mug/l) displayed notochord  degeneration, shortening along the rostral-caudal body axis, and ineffective tail  flips and uncoordinated muscle contractions along the body axis in response to  touch. This phenotype closely resembles zebrafish locomotor mutants of the  accordion class and is consistent with loss of reciprocal inhibitory  neurotransmission by glycinergic commissural interneurons in the spinal cord.  Consistent with the hypothesis that notochord degeneration may be due to abnormal  mechanical stress from muscle tetany, the expression patterns of gene and protein  markers specific to notochord development were unaffected by fipronil. Moreover,  the degenerative effects of fipronil (1.1 microM) were reversed by coexposure to  the sodium channel blocker MS-222 (0.6mM). The notochord effects of fipronil were  phenocopied by exposure to 70 microM strychnine, a glycinergic receptor  antagonist. In contrast, exposure to gabazine, a potent vertebrate GABA(A)  antagonist, resulted in a hyperactive touch response but did not cause notochord  degeneration. Although specifically developed to target insect GABA receptors  with low vertebrate toxicity, our results suggest that fipronil impairs the  development of spinal locomotor pathways in fish by inhibiting a structurally  related glycine receptor subtype. This represents an unanticipated and  potentially novel mechanism for fipronil toxicity in vertebrates.},

Exposure of embryos at 1 h  post fertilization (hpf) to 3-5 μM Cd or 30-100 μM PQ for 9 h induced a 2-3-fold  increase of oxidative stress, while a 6.5-fold increase of oxidative stress was  induced by 200 μM PQ. Real-time RT-PCR detected a down-regulated xeroderma  pigmentosum C (XPC) and an up-regulated UV-DDB2 gene expression in  mildly-stressed embryos, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene  expression increased with PQ exposure levels. NER of UV-damaged DNA was enhanced  in weakly oxidant-stressed embryos as shown by a transcription-based DNA repair  assay, yet repair activities of both UV and cisplatin-damaged DNA were inhibited  in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ. Band shift assay showed a suppression of  cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) binding activity in all stressed embryos. In  contrast, (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP) recognition activity was weakly stimulated  except in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ, revealing a link of NER capacity to 6-4PP  binding. Our results showed that Cd and PQ imposed similar inducing effects on  UV-DDB2 gene expression, NER of UV-damaged DNA and 6-4PP binding activity in  zebrafish embryo under low levels of oxidative stress and NER capacity could be  inhibited if the intensity of oxidative stress increased to a critical level.},

	abstract = {Sodium metam (NaM), a dithiocarbamate, is a general agricultural biocide applied prior to planting for the elimination of nematodes, soil pathogens, and weeds.  There is a remarkable paucity of information about the mechanism of action and  the risk that dithiocarbamates may pose to developing vertebrates. We have  characterized NaM toxicity during early life stage exposure in zebrafish.  Zebrafish embryos are most sensitive to NaM exposure during gastrulation and  early segmentation (4-14 hours post fertilization, hpf). For mortality, the dose  response curve is steep with an LC(50) estimate of 1.95 microM (248 ppb) at 48  hpf. The most notable malformation among surviving embryos was a severely twisted  notochord, which became evident by 24 hpf. Surprisingly, this notochord defect  was not immediately lethal and the animals continued to grow despite delays in  hatching, apparent paralysis, and an inability to feed. We have characterized the  notochord malformation using histological and in situ hybridization techniques.  collagen 2a1 mRNA expression is normally localized to the notochord sheath cells  at 24 hpf, whereas in NaM-exposed embryos it is misexpressed in the notochord  cells. Histological staining and myoD expression indicate that the myotomes of  the NaM-exposed embryos are less defined, compacted and block-shaped compared to  controls. The degradation product of NaM, methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), causes  similar malformations at similar concentrations as NaM, suggesting that MITC or  another common product may be the active toxicant. Our results indicate that  developing zebrafish are sensitive to NaM and MITC and we believe that this model  is ideal to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) and etiology of NaM toxicity in  vertebrates.},

The toxicity of these substances with different modes of action  (acetylcholine esterase inhibitor vs. polar narcosis) was tested for single  substances as well as in binary mixtures. To study effects on different  biological organisation levels (from the molecular up to the whole organism  level) the molecular stress response regarding Hsp70, the embryonic and larval  development and the locomotor activity were investigated as integrative  biomarkers.

We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly  downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this  miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561  (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical  stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we  evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The  expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both  mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil.  The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with  cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced  in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR-155  mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when  endogenous miR-155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR-155 inhibitor. The  results improved our understanding of molecular mechanism of toxicity upon  fipronil exposure, and presents miR-155 as a potential novel toxicological  biomarker for chemical exposure. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using the early life  stages of zebrafish to address scientific questions is lower in cost, more  efficient, and suitable to meeting current legislation than those in other  traditional fish species. Exposure to propiconazole significantly inhibited the  development of zebrafish embryos and larvae. This exposure also caused reduced  locomotor activities in zebrafish. Furthermore, total cholesterol levels,  lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid synthase activities were significantly  decreased. The expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism were  significantly up-regulated in response to propiconazole exposure. GC-MS/MS  analysis revealed that fatty acids were significantly decreased. Together, the  findings indicate the potential environmental risks of propiconazole exposure in  the aquatic ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides are one of the most commonly used residential and agricultural insecticides. Based on the increased use of pyrethroids and recent  studies showing that pregnant women and children are exposed to pyrethroids,  there are concerns over the potential for developmental neurotoxicity. However,  there have been relatively few studies on the developmental neurotoxicity of  pyrethroids. In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity  of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, resmethrin, and  bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and  lambda-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an  appropriate model for studying the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids.  Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in  mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At  doses approaching the LC(50), permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial  abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating  that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower  doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of  the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam  ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS-222  ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced  neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data  suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the  mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid  insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested  in mammalian systems.},

Likely due to its wide-spread  use, IMZ is frequently detected in vegetable, fruit, soil and even surface water  samples. Even though several previous studies have reported on the neurotoxicity  of IMZ, its effects on the neurobehavior of zebrafish have received little  attention to date. In this study, we show that the heartbeat and hatchability of  zebrafish were significantly influenced by IMZ concentrations of 300 μg L(-1) or  higher. Moreover, in zebrafish larvae, locomotor behaviors such as average  swimming speed and swimming distance were significantly decreased after exposure  to 300 μg L(-1) IMZ for 96 h, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression and  activity were consistently inhibited in IMZ-treated fish. Our results further  suggest that IMZ could act as a neuroendocrine disruptor by decreasing the  expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as Glial fibrillary acidic protein  (Gfap), Myelin basic protein (Mbp) and Sonic hedgehog a (Shha) during early  developmental stages of zebrafish. In conclusion, we show that exposure to IMZ  has the potential to induce developmental toxicity and locomotor behavior  abnormalities during zebrafish development.},

Embryos were dechorionated and  waterborne exposed to the endosulfan I or endosulfan sulfate from 6 to 120h  post-fertilization (hpf). Endosulfan I exposure concentrations ranged from 0.01  to 10microg/L and endosulfan sulfate from 1 to 100microg/L. Water solutions were  renewed every 24h and fish were scored for overt developmental and behavioral  abnormalities. Chemical analysis was performed on water, whole embryo, and larvae  samples to determine waterborne exposure concentrations and tissue concentrations  throughout the 5-day period. The most sensitive toxicity endpoint for both  endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate was an abnormal response of the embryo/larvae  to touch, suggesting that endosulfan I and sulfate are developmentally  neurotoxic. The waterborne exposure EC(50)s for inhibition of touch response for  endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate were 2.2microg/L and 23microg/L,  respectively. The endosulfans were highly concentrated by the organisms, and the  inhibition of touch response tissue EC(50), determined from the measured tissue  concentrations, was 367ng/g for endosulfan I and 4552ng/g for endosulfan sulfate.},

In this study,  enantiomers of insecticide acetofenate (AF) were separated on selected chiral  columns by HPLC, and enantioselectivity in developmental toxicity was evaluated  using the zebrafish embryo-larval assays. The AF enantiomers were baseline  separated on Chiralcel OD, Chiralpak AD, and Sumichiral OA-2500I columns under  optimized conditions. Pure enantiomers were obtained on Chiralcel OD. Optical  rotatory dispersion (ORD) and circular dichroism (CD) detectors were used to  determine the elution order and CD spectra of the enantiomers. The absolute  configuration of enantiomers was identified as S-(+)-AF and R-(-)-AF by the  octant rule from force-field calculations and CD spectra. The individual  enantiomers were used in 4-day zebrafish embryo-larval bioassays, and a series of  developmental end points were measured and compared. Quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to investigate the expressions of  estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in zebrafish embryo exposed to varying  enantiomers. While the enantiomers showed no difference in acute toxicity,  significant enantioselectivity was observed in developmental toxicities such as  yolk sac edema and pericardial edema. The data of qRT-PCR showed that there was  about 3.2-fold induction in the mRNA levels of ERalpha between fish exposed to  (+)-AF and (-)-AF. The results suggest that enantioselectivity may occur at the  developmental level even in the absence of selective acute toxicity and should be  considered when evaluating ecotoxicological effects of chiral contaminants.},

Three spirocyclic acids were unfavouring the  lipid accumulation of by inhibited the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid  synthesis (FAS), fatty acid binding proteins (FABP2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL)  activity. The total cholesterol (TCHO) level significantly decreased in the  0.072 mg/L spirodiclofen group and 0.015 and 0.030 mg/L in the spiromesifen  groups. No expected change in spirotetramat group on the TCHO and triglycerides  (TGs) levels for any of the treatments. The mRNA levels of the genes related to  lipid metabolism also significantly altered. In both spirodiclofen and  spiromesifen, ACC achieved the highest scores among a battery of biomarkers using  integrated biomarker response (IBRv2). The results suggest that spiromesifen was  the most toxic for embryos development and spirodiclofen was the most toxic for  lipid metabolism in embryos. The 0.07 mg/L of spirodiclofen, 0.05 mg/L of  spiromesifen and 2.00 mg/L would cause malformation on zebrafish embryos.

We  investigated the expression pattern of four genes, namely, you ( you), yot (  you-too), momo ( mom) and ubo ( u-boot) during early development of zebrafish,  that is, from 12 hpf to 48 hpf stages. These stages are selected as most of the  important developmental aspects take place during this period. All four genes are  known to play a vital role in development of notochord and somites. To understand  the effect of DM on development, embryos of 4 hpf stage were exposed to two  concentrations (100 and 200 µg/L) of DM, and observations were made at 12, 24 and  48 hpf stages. Our earlier studies have shown phenotypic abnormalities such as  notochord bending, tail deformation, yolk sac and pericardial edema, lightening  of body and eye pigmentation and interfered in somite patterning, during these  stages of development. Understanding the relationship of phenotypic abnormalities  with these four genes has been our primary objective. These four genes were  analyzed by Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction and intensity of  the bands has shown induction in their expression after exposure to the toxicant.  In spite of the expression of genes, it was noticed that DM caused abnormalities.  It can be said from the results that translational pathway could have been  affected.},

PBZ affects  the normal process of cardiac looping, which may lead to a slower heart beat  accompanied by pericardia edema and apoptotic myocytes.

This indicates  that the toxicity to shrimp is likely stereochemistry-dependent. The fates of GCH  and LCH are similar in laboratory simulated rice paddy water and their  concentrations decrease rapidly, with no GCH or LCH detected after 3 or 4 days.  Both are toxic to shrimp in a simulated paddy irrigation reservoir even though  treated return water is diluted 5 times. No shrimp fatality is shown in the  GCH-treated paddy water after a 4-day holding period, and longer than 5 days is  necessary to reach a zero fatality rate for LCH.

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system (CNS)  following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. Zebrafish were fed  pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8μg/g dieldrin for 21days. Behavioral  analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to  anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were  decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,  consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes  related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by  dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap  identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These  proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated  protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal  recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were  functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis  implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases  associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial  dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association  between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic  and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative  diseases. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine  pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as  Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for  human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed  to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are  altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and  protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's  disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight  into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the  association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration.  These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework  for pesticide induced neurotoxicity.},

Enzymes are often taken as biomarkers of exposure and  effect. Therefore cholinesterase isozymes and carboxylesterase were examined for  their suitability as biomarkers of insecticide exposure. The activities of  cholinesterase and of carboxylesterase were monitored in the first 48 h  post-fertilization (hpf) of zebrafish development. Significant specific  activities in the range of 0.5-25 U could be measured from the sixth somite stage  (12 h) up to the Long Pec stage (48 h) for different cholinesterases using  acetyl-, acetyl-beta-methyl-, butyryl- and propionylthiocholin as substrates. The  specific activity of carboxylesterase ranged from 4 to 16 Umg(-1) protein in the  respective developmental stages. Substrate specificity was analysed using  specific inhibitors (eserine sulphate, DPDA, BW284c51). The results showed that  the observed cholinesterase activities in the whole embryo may be attributed  mainly to acetylcholinesterase with a partial capability to use  propionylthiocholine as a second substrate. The potential use of cholin- and  carboxylesterase as biomarkers was investigated using the organophosphate  paraoxon-methyl. A 40\% inhibition of enzyme activities was reached by 0.4 microM  paraoxon-methyl indicating the possible use of these enzymes as biomarkers of  exposure.},

	abstract = {Bifenthrin (BF) is a synthetic pyrethroid that targets the nervous system of insects and may have adverse effects on the behavior and development of nontarget  organisms. However, no reports have been issued on the effects of different  enantiomers on locomotor behavior for synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) in zebrafish,  and whether locomotor activity is associated with the developmental toxicities  remains unclear. In this study, enantioselectivity of BF (1S and 1R) on the acute  locomotor activity and developmental toxicities of embryonic-larval zebrafish  were first evaluated. The results indicated that 1R-BF was more toxic, causing  morphological impairments, with a 96-h median effective concentration (EC50) of  226 microg/L for pericardial edema and 145 microg/L for curved body axis.  Administration of 20 microg/L of one enantiomer of BF had differential effects on  the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 4 d postfertilization (dpf) under  alternating light and dark conditions. Larvae treated with 1R-BF were not  sensitive to the alteration of light to dark, and the locomotor activities were  reduced to a level similar to that observed in light, which otherwise increased  rapidly and markedly. However, 1S-BF did not alter the general pattern of  zebrafish response to the light or dark compared with the control. The results  demonstrated that the differential effects on development might have contributed  to the enantioselectivity in the locomotor activity. The consistency of  enantioselectivity with insecticidal activity may also indicate a common mode of  action. Furthermore, 1R-BF accelerated the spontaneous movement and hatching  process, whereas 1S-BF seemed to be inhibitory. The results suggest the need to  link behavioral changes to developmental toxicities in order to achieve more  comprehensive health risk assessments of chiral pesticides.},

However, the increase in agriculture and husbandry  activities in the region has contributed with residues of pesticides reaching  aquatic systems. The main objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity of  the endemic shrimp M. pantanalense compared with other freshwater species: the  shrimp M. amazonicum, the crustacean Daphnia similis and the fish Danio rerio.  The sensitivity of these organisms was assessed through acute exposure to copper  and cypermethrin (through the formulation Barrage(®), widely used in Pantanal).  For copper the species sensitivity decreased in the following order: D. similis  (48 h-EC(50) 0.051 mg/L) {\textgreater} M. pantanalense {\textgreater} D. rerio {\textgreater} M. amazonicum (48  h-LC(50) 26.34 mg/L). Copper caused reduced length of shrimps and zebrafish and  reduced heartbeat of zebrafish embryos. For cypermethrin the species sensitivity  decreased in the following order: M. pantanalense (96 h-LC(50)  0.05 μg/L) {\textgreater} M. amazonicum {\textgreater} D. similis {\textgreater} D. rerio (144 h-LC(50) 1680 μg/L).  Major effects of cypermethrin included reduced length of shrimps and zebrafish,  as well as early hatching and increased incidence of developmental deformities in  zebrafish embryos. This study highlights the importance of using endemic species  for risk evaluations in sensitive biomes such as Pantanal. Moreover, it  emphasizes the importance of testing pesticides toxicity as commercial  formulations. Furthermore, we suggest that the endemic shrimp species  M. pantanalense can be successfully used as a test species in ecotoxicology.},

The nonlethal effects of malathion on  developing zebrafish embryos, however, previously have not been analyzed  quantitatively. We exposed zebrafish embryos to sublethal malathion  concentrations to determine malathion's effects on a developing vertebrate.  Zebrafish exposed to 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/L of malathion consistently elicited  more rapid hatching from the chorion than zebrafish exposed to 2.0-, 2.5-, or  3.0-mg/L malathion concentrations. In addition, exposure to 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 mg/L  of malathion resulted in significantly shorter body length and eye diameters,  indicating that malathion had teratogenic effects on zebrafish embryos.  Malathion's action as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and the toxicity of the  metabolites of malathion may be responsible for malathion's teratogenic effects  on fish development.},

We used the  metabolomic approach and UHPLC-ESI-MS to analyze liver samples to investigate the  adverse effects of glyphosate on hepatic metabolism. The impact of GLY was found  to be sex-specific. In female, GLY exposure affected purine metabolism by  decreasing the levels of AMP, GMP and inosinic acid, consequently increasing uric  acid levels with respect to the control (CTRL). Exposure to GLY also caused a  decrease of UMP levels in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. In male, GLY  exposure decreased the aminoadipic acid within the lysine degradation pathway.  Transcript analysis of genes involved in stress response, oxidative stress and  the immune system were also performed. Results demonstrated an increased stress  response in both sexes, as suggested by higher nr3c1 expression. However, the  hsp70.2 transcript level was increased in female but decreased in male. The  results demonstrated reduced sod1, sod2, and gpx1a in male following exposure to  GLY, indicating an impaired oxidative stress response. At the same time, an  increase in the cat transcript level in female was observed. mRNA levels of the  pro-inflammatory interleukins litaf and cxcl8b.1 were increased in female. Taken  together, the results provide evidence of disrupted nucleotide hepatic  metabolism, increased stress inflammatory response in female and disruption of  oxidative stress response in male.},

However,  endocrine-disruption in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal-liver (HPGL) axis, the  effects of transferring to offspring, and the underlying mechanisms of  difenoconazole in aquatic organisms are still unknown. In this study, we defined  the effects of difenoconazole at environmental concentrations on endocrine  disturbance using zebrafish as an experimental model. The results indicated that  difenoconazole induced a significant change in the somatic index, and  pathological variations in tissues, and steroid hormone levels. RT-PCR  experiments further confirmed that difenoconazole significantly induced  expression alteration of lhr, hsd3β, hsd11β, cyp19a in the ovary and star,  cyp19a, cyp3c1 in the testis, and erα genes in livers. In addition,  difenoconazole exposure in parental zebrafish affected the hatchability and  length of its offspring. Moreover, the burdens of difenoconazole and  difenoconazole alcohol in females were higher than in males. These findings  highlighted that difenoconazole exposure at environmentally relevant  concentrations elicited estrogenic endocrine-disruption effects via altering  homeostasis of sex steroid hormones in the HPGL axis and the adverse effects can  be transferred to the offspring.},

In the present study, we used embryos of the zebrafish  (Danio rerio) as a model to assess the toxic potential of ammonium-based ionic  liquids for aquatic organisms. As we assumed interference of the partially  hydrophobic ionic liquid cation with lipids, we investigated the adaptation  response in the lipid composition of the zebrafish embryos, triggered by the  ionic compound. Therefore, the impact of ammonium-based ionic liquids with  different lengths of the alkyl chain ([C6,C6,C1,C1N][Br], [C8,C8,C1,C1N][Br]) on  the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profile of zebrafish embryos up to 72 hours  post fertilization (hpf) was examined. Furthermore, the changes in the  unsaturation index (UI) of PLFAs, as the sum parameter of membrane fluidity in  eukaryotic cells, were presented. The PLFA's UI in the zebrafish embryos upon  exposure to quaternary ammonium salts was compared to the UI of the embryos upon  exposure to nonionic 2,4-dichlorophenol, which has a similar hydrophobicity but  is structurally different to [C8,C8,C1,C1N][Br]. It was shown that for  ammonium-based ionic liquid precursors non-specific mode of action occurs and the  toxic effect on lipid composition of zebrafish embryos can be well predicted  based on chemical properties, like hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the changes in  PLFAs, expressed by the UI, can be useful to study toxic effects of organic  contamination. However, for zebrafish embryos, after ionic liquids and 2,4-DCP  exposure, the changes were observed at high lethal concentrations, which caused  the incidence of lethality of 30 and 50\% of a group of test animals.},

Cis-BF enantiomers exhibited the equal maternal transfer potentials.  GC/MSD analysis showed that parental 1S-cis-BF exposure could disrupt the  components of fatty acids in offspring embryos. In transcriptional expression,  the whole differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in GO  categories, including the processes related to lipid biosynthesis/metabolism. The  perturbations of fatty acids suggested that cis-BF has potential negative impacts  on embryos' development. Furthermore, enantioselective growth inhibition and  developmental neurotoxicity in larvae were also observed. The mRNA expressions of  neuronal development genes were significantly changed in 1S-exposed offspring, so  were the levels of the neurotransmitters and larval locomotion. Our results show  that the cis-BF induced the growth inhibition and neurotoxicity in zebrafish  larvae, which may be mediated by the development interference in embryos related  to the disrupted fatty acid composition.

	abstract = {Tebuconazole is a widely used fungicide that has been detected in water ecosystems, of which the concentrations may affect the endocrine function of  aquatic organisms. At present study, tissue-specific bioaccumulation of  tebuconazole was found in ovary of adult zebrafish, indicating a potential risk  of endocrine disruption. In order to evaluate the potential endocrine disrupting  effects, three life stages (2 hpf (hours post-fertilization) -60 dpf (days  post-fertilization), Stage I; 60-120 dpf, Stage II; 180-208 dpf, Stage III) of  zebrafish (Danio rerio) were chronically exposed to tebuconazole at the  concentrations ranging from 0.05 mg/L to 1.84 mg/L. Result showed that exposed to  tebuconazole could lead to a male-biased sex differentiation in juvenile  zebrafish and significant decrease of the percentage of germ cells in  sexually-mature zebrafish. Egg production was significantly inhibited by 57.8\%  and 19.2\% after Stage II- and Stage III-exposures, respectively. The contents of  17β-estradiol in gonad decreased by 63.5\% when exposed to 0.20 mg/L tebuconazole  at Stage II and by 49.5\% after exposed to 0.18 mg/L tebuconazole at Stage III,  respectively. For all stages exposure, reductions in 17β-estradiol/testosterone  ratio were observed, indicating an imbalance in steroids synthesis. Additionally,  tebuconazole reduced the expression of cyp19a, which was consistent with the  decrease of E2 level. In overall, the present findings indicated that, playing as  an anti-estrogen-like chemical, tebuconazole inhibited the expression of Cyp19,  thereby impairing steroid hormones biosynthesis, leading to a diminished  fecundity of zebrafish.},

It is known that these  compounds impact non-target invertebrates, such as bees and gammaridae, in terms  of toxicity and behavior, but impacts and species differences on vertebrates such  as fish are little explored. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare  the effects of one widely used neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on development and  behavior of two fish model species: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka  (Oryzias latipes). Fish were exposed for 5 (zebrafish) and 14 (medaka) days from  0.2 to 2000 μg/L imidacloprid by aqueous exposure. Survival, development,  behavior and histological features were monitored and organism-internal  concentrations and biotransformation products measured. Imidacloprid caused  sublethal effects in both species but the effects were much stronger in medaka  with deformities, lesions and reduced growth being the most prominent impacts.  Due to the overall longer time of development, time-integrated exposure of medaka  was about 2-fold higher compared to zebrafish, potentially accounting for parts  of the sensitivity differences. Our results underline the importance of taking  species sensitivity differences into account especially when considering that  medaka responded at imidacloprid concentrations that have been measured in the  environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides are becoming more widely applied as organophosphate (OP) insecticides are decreasing in use. Because of their  relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have  reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published  literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of  vertebrates to neonicotinoids. METHODS: Using zebrafish, we investigated the  neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic  neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish  were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 μM or 60 μM of  imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4h to 5d post fertilization.  The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidacloprid and  nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and during adolescence  and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of  sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank  swimming, and shoaling behavior. RESULTS: In larvae, developmental imidacloprid  exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains  of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidacloprid than the AB*  strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid  significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor  response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming,  it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects  of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling  stimulus. DISCUSSION: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both  early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its  developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated.},

	abstract = {In this study, the effects of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) in males and females of  adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were studied. The liver microsomal cytochrome P450  content, NADPH-P450 reductase, aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND), and erythromycin  N-demethylase (ERND) activity were measured. Zebrafish were exposed to control  and 3 treatments (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg L(-1)) of atrazine for 5, 10, 15, 20, and  25 days. The results indicated that, within the range of test atrazine  concentrations, either P450 content or P450 isozyme activities could be induced  by atrazine. Compared to controls, P450 content was significantly increased at  all atrazine concentrations at days 10, 15, and 20; thereafter, at day 25, all  concentrations decreased to approximately the control levels, both in males and  females. In addition, the strongest induction of P450 content was observed on day  15 in males and day 10 in females at treatment concentrations of 1 mg L(-1).  NADPH-P450 reductase activities showed mild increase in males; however, the  females exhibited significant induction on days 15, 20, and 25; especially, at  concentrations of 0.01 mg L(-1), the induction level was consistently increased  during the experiment. The inducements of APND and ERND in males were mainly  observed on the days 5, 10, and 15, which showed less distinct induction, while  significant induction was observed in cases of treatments during all days in  females. In conclusion, atrazine induces P450 enzymes in zebrafish, and the  effects may function as significant toxicity mechanisms in zebrafish.  Additionally, it also confirms the importance of using a combined multi-time and  multi-index diagnostic method to enhance the sensitivity and effectiveness of the  indices adopted.},

Atrazine, a common agricultural herbicide used throughout the  Midwestern United States, frequently contaminates potable water supplies and is a  suspected endocrine disrupting chemical. In our previous studies, zebrafish was  exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion (μg/l) atrazine through  embryogenesis, rinsed, and allowed to mature to adulthood. A decrease in spawning  was observed with morphological alterations in offspring. In addition, adult  females displayed an increase in ovarian progesterone and follicular atresia,  alterations in levels of a serotonin metabolite and serotonin turnover in brain  tissue, and transcriptome changes in brain and ovarian tissue supporting  neuroendocrine alterations. As reproductive dysfunction is also influenced by  males, this study assessed testes histology, hormone levels, and transcriptomic  profiles of testes and brain tissue in the adult males. The embryonic atrazine  exposure resulted in no alterations in body or testes weight, gonadosomatic  index, testes histology, or levels of 11-ketotestosterone or testosterone. To  further investigate potential alterations, transcriptomic profiles of adult male  testes and brain tissue was completed. This analysis demonstrated alterations in  genes associated with abnormal cell and neuronal growth and morphology; molecular  transport, quantity, and production of steroid hormones; and neurotransmission  with an emphasis on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and  hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axes. Overall, this data indicate future studies  should focus on additional neuroendocrine endpoints to determine potential  functional impairments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the possibility of using a mixture of three fungal toxins produced by Ascochyta caulina as a bioherbicide to control  noxious weeds. However, to assess the commercial potential of this new  bioherbicide, it is necessary to increase knowledge regarding the environmental  behaviour of these toxins, and particularly their effects on non-target  organisms. A negative ecotoxicological profile of this potential bioherbicide  could eventually hinder its registration. RESULTS: In this study, acute and  chronic effects of the A. caulina toxins (ACTs) on non-target organisms were  evaluated in the laboratory. The (96 h) calculated algal Er C50 and NOEC were  142.7 and {\textless}12.5 mg L(-1) respectively. For daphnids, the EC50 (48 h, acute test)  was 20.1 mg L(-1) , whereas the NOEC (21 day chronic reproduction test) was  6.3 µg L(-1) . No cases of mortality, sublethal effects or abnormalities were  observed in the acute and chronic tests for Brachydanio rerio at a concentration  of 100 mg L(-1) , indicating a low toxicity of ACTs for this organism. The  calculated LC50 (14 days, acute test) and NOEC (56 day chronic reproduction) for  earthworms were {\textgreater}1000 and ≥250 mg kg(-1) soil respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The  present study has provided baseline information needed to assess the potential  hazard of the fungal toxins of A. caulina. In particular, the acute and chronic  effects on aquatic (algae, Daphnia and fish) and terrestrial organisms  (earthworms) have been highlighted. Finally, a comparison of the inherent  toxicity of ACTs with other synthetic herbicides has shown comparative  ecotoxicity of the tested mixture.},

Uptake rates for the diffusion controlled passive uptake through the  ZFE membrane ranged from 0.02 to 24 h(-1) for the nonionic compounds and were  slower for ionic compounds ({\textless}0.008-0.08 h(-1)). The study compounds did not  enrich much in the ZFE (median bioconcentration factor of 1, max. 7).  Biotransformation significantly influenced the internal concentration of some of  the test compounds over time (benzocaine, phenacetin, metribuzin, phenytoin,  thiacloprid, valproic acid). For benzocaine, valproic acid and phenacetin several  transformation products (TPs) were observed by LC-MS already at early life-stages  (before 28 hpf); for benzocaine the TPs comprised {\textgreater}90\% of the initial amount  taken up into the ZFE. For six compounds internal concentrations remained very  low (rel. int. conc. {\textless} 0.2). Besides biotransformation (sulfamethoxazole), poor  membrane permeability (cimetidine, colchicine) and also affinity to efflux  transporters (atropine and chloramphenicol) are the likely reasons for these low  internal concentrations. This study outlines that the uptake of polar compounds  into ZFE is influenced by their physicochemical properties. However, biological  processes, biotransformation and, likely, efflux can strongly affect the internal  concentrations already in early developmental stages of the ZFE. This should be  considered in future toxicokinetic modeling. The evaluation of the toxicity of  chemicals by ZFE requires toxicokinetic studies of the test compounds and their  TPs to increase comparability to effects in fish.},

	abstract = {Endosulfan is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide that is still widely in use in many developing countries. Following application, endosulfan can get to  watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the  non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the  activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently  used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results  concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim  of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE  activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as  an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in  different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory  formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 μg endosulfan/L group  presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 ± 1.038 μmol SCh h(-1) mg  protein(-1); p=0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 ± 1.768 μmol SCh  h(-1) mg protein(-1); p=0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40\%. The  down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the  transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results  reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in  brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 μg endosulfan/L during 96 h  impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (≈21\%,  273.7 ± 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 ±  21.30, p=0.0483), traveled distance (≈20\%, 23.44 ± 2.127 m compared to the  control group 29.39 ± 1.585, p=0.0281), mean speed (≈25\%, 0.03 ± 0.003 m/s  compared to the control group 0.04 ± 0.002, p=0.0275) and body turn angle (≈21\%,  69,940 ± 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88,010 ± 4560,  p=0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs  animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological  and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan  exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance  apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of  endosulfan exposure in the nervous system.},

To gain a better understanding of the response of zebrafish embryos to CPF  exposure, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) coupled  with mass spectrometry was employed to carry out a comparative proteomic  analysis. Total proteins were extracted from the control and treated samples,  separated by 2D PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. A total of 59 protein  spots showed reproducible changes compared with the control. Of these 59 spots,  19 were selected and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  (MALDI) tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/TOF) analysis; 9  differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified, including 3  up-regulated proteins and 6 down-regulated proteins. The increased expression of  3 proteins associated with detoxification and stress response suggested that the  activation of protective proteins was required in zebrafish embryos exposed to  CPF. On the other hand, the decreased expression of 6 proteins is mainly involved  in cytoskeleton structure, protein translation, signal transduction and  lipoprotein metabolism. These data may help us understand the functions and the  molecular mechanisms of these proteins in zebrafish embryos' response to CPF  exposure.},

In this study, we used zebrafish as an environmental  monitoring model to further explore the potential toxicity of fenvalerate. Our  results demonstrated that larvae exposed to fenvalerate for 24-96 h displayed  obvious morphological abnormalities, and the LC50 concentrations were 131.95  microg/L (LC50-24h), 107.18 microg/L (LC50-48 h), 21.76 microg/L (LC50-72 h), and  6.25 microg/L (LC50-96 h). To further investigate the effects of fenvalerate on  embryos and larvae, acridine orange staining was performed at a 50 microg/L  concentration. Staining showed notable signs of apoptosis mainly in the brain.  Further studies revealed that fenvalerate induced alterations in SOD activity in  larvae were concentration dependent and also related to the length of exposure.  Fenvalerate also down-regulated the expression of ogg1 and dlx2 genes in a  concentration dependent manner, which indicated that the oxidative-DNA repair  system as well as neurogenesis were impaired. In this study, we investigated the  toxicity of fenvalerate using zebrafish, that provided new evidence of observable  brain impairment during embryogenesis due to fenvalerate exposure and discussed  their implications for the development of fenvalerate induced neurotoxicity.},

In  the present study, we used two-dimensional electrophoresis to investigate the  proteome of female and male zebrafish brain after 96 h exposure to the fungicide  prochloraz. Prochloraz has known effects on a number of key HPG molecules,  including antagonism of Cyp17 and Cyp19 (aromatase). Twenty-eight proteins were  shown to be differentially expressed in the brains of females and 22 in males.  Proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS and identities were examined relative to  brain function in the context of changing steroid hormone levels. There was  little overlap between sexes in proteins exhibiting differential expression.  Proteins with known roles in metabolism, learning, neuroprotection, and calcium  regulation were determined to be differentially regulated. Relationships between  identified proteins were also examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and  females were shown to exhibit enrichment of several metabolic pathways. We used  differentially expressed proteins to establish a putative classifier consisting  of three proteins that was able to discriminate prochloraz-exposed from control  females. Putatively impacted brain functions and specific protein changes that  were observed have the potential to be generalized to other that similarly impact  steroid hormone levels.},

Zebrafish were exposed to control and three treatments  (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L) of atrazine for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days. The results  indicated that, for males, the GST activity at lower atrazine concentrations  (0.01 and 0.1 mg/L) was markedly higher than that of the controls throughout the  duration of the experiment while there was a significant inhibition of the GST  activity at 1 mg/L atrazine at days 5 and 20. For females, a significant increase  was detected at 0.1 mg/L on the days 5 and 15 and at 0.01 mg/L on day 20. The DNA  damage in zebrafish was evaluated using the comet assay; the olive tail moments  obtained for hepatopancreas were enhanced after treatment with different  concentrations of atrazine on days 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. The DNA damage  increased with increasing atrazine concentrations, indicating that genotoxicity  of atrazine and significant differences was found compared to the controls. In  conclusion, these findings provide further evidence of the effects of atrazine on  aquatic ecosystems.},

Also, it was  used to judge toxic mechanism of chemicals. The embryo development of zebrafish  can be affected obviously by heavy metal, pesticide, organic reagent and complex  chemicals. Among them, Cu and Hg appeared stronger toxicity, and Cr was weaker  for heavy metals. TPTA and Lindane were higher toxicity within pesticide, and  they were higher toxicity if the organic reagent with one or more halogen  substituent(s) and aminobenzene. These results were correspondent with other  toxicity testing, and it showed higher sensitivity, especially a sublethal  endpoint was selected.

In this  study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to varying concentrations of  (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb until 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) to  assess the embryonic toxicity. (-)-R-indoxacarb was 1.3-fold more toxic than  (+)-S-isomer to zebrafish embryos at 96 hpf. (-)-R-indoxacarb exhibited reduction  in body length and pericardial edema compared with (+)-S-indoxacarb.

The heart rate of the larvae  exposed to (-)-R-indoxacarb was 30\% lower than that to (+)-S-indoxacarb. In  addition, exposure to the chiral isomers resulted in significant increases in  apoptosis; interestingly (-)-R-indoxacarb induced apoptosis in the heart area,  whereas (+)-S-indoxacarb induced apoptosis in the head area. © 2015 Wiley  Periodicals, Inc.

In males, QpE exposure  significantly increased plasma estradiol (E2) and vitellogenin (VTG) levels,  concomitant with up-regulation of hepatic esr1 and vtg gene expression. In  females, plasma sex hormone levels and VTG concentrations were not altered  significantly, but an increased expression of hepatic esr1 in addition to  decreased expression of hepatic vtg, esr2a and esr2b was observed. Marked  histological lesions were also observed in the gonads of both males and females.  Moreover, QpE exposure significantly increased transcriptional profiles of some  genes in the HPG axis and liver in males, while the majority of these genes were  down-regulated in females. Docking studies showed QpE forming stable interactions  with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of zebrafish ESR1 and ESR2a, suggesting QpE  may bind to estrogen receptors (ESRs). This study for the first time reveals QpE  as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) disrupting the zebrafish endocrine  system in a sex-specific manner, whereby it increases estrogen axis activity in  males and slightly decreases estrogen axis activity in females, which may be  accounted for by QpE regulating steroidogenesis and/or activating ESR(s).},

In addition, both Pq10- and  Pq20-treated animals exhibited differential effects on the absolute turn angle.  Nonmotor behaviors were also evaluated, and no changes were observed in  anxiety-related behaviors or social interactions in Pq-treated zebrafish.  However, Pq-treated animals demonstrated impaired acquisition and consolidation  of spatial memory in the Y-maze task. Interestingly, dopamine levels increased  while DOPAC levels decreased in the zebrafish brain after both treatments.  However, DAT expression decreased in the Pq10-treated group, and there was no  change in the Pq20-treated group. The amount of TH protein showed no significant  difference in the treated group.

Ovaries (n = 18 per triplicate) were exposed to 65 μg/L  of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] for 15 d. This concentration was  determined according to Resolution 357/2005/CONAMA/Brazil, which establishes the  permissible concentration of glyphosate in Brazilian inland waters. Nonexposed  ovaries (n = 18 per triplicate) were used as control. Subsequently, morphology  and expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) of exposed and nonexposed ovaries  was determined. No apparent changes were noted in general morphology of exposed  and nonexposed ovaries. However, a significant increase in diameter of oocytes  was observed after exposure to glyphosate. When ovarian ultrastructure was  examined the presence of concentric membranes, appearing as myelin-like  structures, associated with the external membranes of mitochondria and with yolk  granules was found. After glyphosate exposure, immunohistochemistry and  immunoblotting revealed greater expression of SF-1 in the oocytes, which suggests  a relationship between oocyte growth and SF-1 expression. These subtle adverse  effects of glyphosate on oocytes raised a potential concern for fish  reproduction. These results contribute to understanding glyphosate-induced  toxicity to nontarget organisms, showing subcellular and molecular impairments  that may affect reproduction in +female fish.},

Different trends in  gene expression were observed after exposure to 50, 100, 200μg/L acetochlor for  96h. Results demonstrated that the transcription patterns of many key genes  involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal/thyroid (HPG/HPT) axis (e.g.,  VTG1, ERβ1, CYP19a and TRα), cell apoptosis pathway (e.g., Bcl2, Bax, P53 and  Cas8), as well as innate immunity (e.g., CXCL-C1C, IL-1β and TNFα) were affected  in newly hatched zebrafish after exposure to acetochlor. In addition, the  up-regulation of CAT, GPX, GPX1a, Cu/Zn-SOD and Ogg1 suggested acetochlor might  trigger oxidative stress in zebrafish. These finding indicated that acetochlor  could simultaneously induce multiple responses during zebrafish embryonic  development, and bidirectional interactions among oxidative stress, apoptosis  pathway, immune and endocrine systems might be present.},

It has been reported that dithiocarbamates, including  thiuram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), cause wavy distortions of the notochord  in zebrafish and other fish embryos. In the present study, we investigated the  mechanism underlying the toxicity of thiuram in zebrafish embryos. When embryos  were exposed to thiuram (2-1000 nM: 0.48-240 microg/L) from 3 h post  fertilization (hpf) (30\% epiboly) until 24 hpf (Prim-5), all embryos develop wavy  notochords, disorganized somites, and have shortened yolk sac extensions. The  thiuram response was specific and did not cause growth retardation or mortality  at 24 hpf. The thiuram-dependent responses showed the same concentration  dependence with a waterborne EC50 values of approximately 7 nM. Morphometric  measurements revealed that thiuram does not affect the rate of notochord  lengthening. However, the rate of overall body lengthening was significantly  reduced in thiuram-exposed animals. Other dithiocarbamates, such as ziram, caused  similar malformations to thiuram. While expression of genes involved in  somitogenesis was not affected, the levels of notochord-specific transcripts were  altered after the onset of malformations. Distortion of the notochord started  precisely at 18 hpf, which is concomitant with onset of spontaneous rhythmic  trunk contractions. Abolishment of spontaneous contractions using tricaine,  alpha-bungarotoxin, and a paralytic mutant sofa potato, resulted in normal  notochord morphology in the presence of thiuram. These results indicate that  muscle activity is necessary to reveal the underlying functional deficit and  suggest that the developmental target of dithiocarbamates impairs trunk  plasticity through an unknown mechanism.},

In this study, we evaluated the potential toxic effects of naphthalene  on livers in female adult zebrafish over a 21-day subacute exposure. Global  hepatic gene expression was examined by microarrays and the results indicated the  regulated genes were associated significantly with vital hepatic injury pathways  and GO categories upon naphthalene exposure, such as disruptions in lipid  metabolism, inflammatory response, and the carcinogenic processes. According to  our observations of liver histology, nuclear enlargement as a potential indicator  of cancers and hepatic lipometabolic disorder precisely were supported. The 96 h  acute naphthalene tests on Tg(lysC:DsRed) and LiPan lines larvae revealed  recruitment of neutrophils by the liver, as well as decreased liver size, which  further confirmed hepatic inflammation response to naphthalene exposure. Thus,  these findings advance the field of ecotoxicology by unveiling a new role of  naphthalene as a leading cause of liver damage and provide potential  biomarker-genes for environmental naphthalene monitoring.},

We studied the effects  of CYP exposure on the induction of hepatic oxidative stress, DNA damage and the  alteration of gene expression related to apoptosis in adult zebrafish. Hepatic  mRNA levels for the genes encoding antioxidant proteins, such as Cu/Zn-Sod,  Mn-Sod, Cat, and Gpx, were significantly upregulated when zebrafish were exposed  to various concentrations of CYP for 4 or 8 days. In addition, the main genes  related to fatty acid β-oxidation and the mitochondrial genes related to  respiration and ATP synthesis were also significantly upregulated after exposure  to high concentrations (1 and 3 μg L(-1)) of CYP for 4 or 8 days. Moreover, in a  comet assay of zebrafish hepatocytes, tail DNA, tail length, tail moment and  Olive tail moment increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The significant  induction (p{\textless}0.01) of all four parameters observed with CYP concentrations of 0.3  μg L(-1) or higher suggests that heavy DNA damage was induced even at low levels.  Furthermore, several apoptosis- related genes, such as p53, Apaf1 and Cas3, were  significantly upregulated after CYP exposure, and Bcl2/Bax expression ratio  decreased, especially in groups treated with 1 and 3 μg L(-1) CYP for 8 days.

Metabolomic and transcription  analyses were performed with 0.01 and 0.10 mg/L mefentrifluconazole and its  enantiomers (i.e., rac-mfz/(-)-mfz/(+)-mfz) at 28 days. The (1)H nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics analysis showed that 9, 10 and 4 metabolites  were changed significantly in the rac-mfz, (+)-mfz and (-)-mfz treatment groups  compared with the control group, respectively. The differential metabolites were  related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The  qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of lipid metabolism-, apoptosis-  and CYP-related genes in the livers of female zebrafish in rac-mfz and (+)-mfz  was 1.61-108.92 times and 2.37-551.34 times higher than that in (-)-mfz,  respectively.

Results indicate that atrazine significantly decreased the  activity of maintenance DNMTs and that the inhibition mechanism can be described  using non-competitive Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, results show that  an embryonic atrazine exposure decreases global methylation levels and the  expression of dnmt4 and dnmt5.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Terbuthylazine belongs to the group of symmetrical triazine herbicides used extensively in agriculture and non-agricultural sites, primarily  to control broadleaf and some grassy weeds that have become ubiquitous  contaminants of the environment. The aim of this study was to assess the impact  of terbuthylazine in surface waters on fish under experimental conditions. The  effects of subchronic exposure to terbuthylazine on fish growth and the  development of histopathological changes in selected organs (gill, kidney,  liver), and on the activity of some biochemical parameters - glutathione  S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)  and on the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in  Danio rerio were investigated during a 28 day toxicity test. METHODS: Juvenile  growth tests were performed on Danio rerio according to OECD guideline No. 215.  Fish at the age of 30 days were exposed for 28 days to a range of sublethal  concentrations of terbuthylazine (0.55 - environmental concentration, 150, 400,  700 and 1000 μg/L). RESULTS: There were no significant differences (p{\textless}0.05)  between the specific growth rates (r) of the test groups and control group.  Histopathological examination revealed pathological changes only in the liver in  fish exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 700 and 1000 μg/L.  Significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) in activities of biochemical markers were found  in GST (400, 700 and 1000 μg/L), GR (700 and 1000 μg/L), significant differences  (p{\textless}0.05) of TBARS concentration were found at 1000 μg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Based on  the results of growth rate, the histopathological examination of selected organs,  and the results of biochemical parameters, it was found that the environmental  concentration of terbuthylazine did not have any effects on juvenile D. rerio.  The values of NOEC and LOEC for terbuthylazine for juvenile D. rerio were 150  μg/L and 400 μg/L.},

In this study, we assessed genotoxicity or DNA damage by the alkaline  comet assay in zebrafish blastula-stage embryos exposed to 250 to 1250 μg/mL of  the Monceren fungicide or to Bleomycin (0.25 μg/mL) used as a positive control.  Additionally, survival and spontaneous movement were monitored in embryos after  exposure to different concentrations of fungicide. DNA damage was evaluated using  three genotoxicity parameters of the alkaline comet assay: tail length, tail  moment, and tail intensity. We found that Monceren 250 SC fungicide induces DNA  damage, as shown by significant increases in the three genotoxicity parameters in  zebrafish embryos compared with control embryos nonexposed to Monceren. Tail  intensity was the more accurate parameter to evaluate genotoxicity levels in  zebrafish embryos. At 48 h after exposure to the fungicide, the survival rate of  larvae-embryos was reduced to 40-45\%. This study shows that the Monceren 250 SC  fungicide exerts genotoxic effects in zebrafish during early stages of  development.},

Acute toxicity tests were carried out and the median lethal  concentration (LC(50)) from 24 to 96 h was calculated. The fish were exposed to a  sublethal fungicide concentration of 230 microg/L for 7 or 14 days and allowed to  recover for 7 or 14 more days, respectively. Whole-body levels of vitellogenins,  triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, lactate and proteins as well as the  activities gamma-glutamil transpeptidase (gamma-GT), alanin aminotransferase  (AlAT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were assayed;  corpulence factor (k) was also calculated. Fish exhibited significant increase of  vitellogenins (Vtg), which continued to increase after 14 days of recovery.  Levels of glucose, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides increased after 7 and  14 days of exposure. Finally, cholesterol and glucose recovered after 14 days of  recovery whereas triglycerides and lactate continued to be elevated. Proteins and  k remained unaltered the entire experiments. AAT, AlAT and AP enhanced during  exposure and did not recover at the end (except AlAT). A longer recovery period  should be necessary to re-establish fish physiology. These results alert about  the multiple disruptive physiological actions that tebuconazole may have on fish.},

Atrazine is frequently found to contaminate potable water  supplies above the maximum contaminant level of 3μg/L as defined by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency. The developmental origin of adult disease  hypothesis suggests that toxicant exposure during development can increase the  risk of certain diseases during adulthood. However, the molecular mechanisms  underlying disease progression are still unknown. In this study, zebrafish  embryos were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30μg/L atrazine throughout embryogenesis.  Larvae were then allowed to mature under normal laboratory conditions with no  further chemical treatment until 7 days post fertilization (dpf) or adulthood and  neurotransmitter analysis completed. No significant alterations in  neurotransmitter levels was observed at 7dpf or in adult males, but a significant  decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and serotonin turnover was seen  in adult female brain tissue. Transcriptomic analysis was completed on adult  female brain tissue to identify molecular pathways underlying the observed  neurological alterations. Altered expression of 1928, 89, and 435 genes in the  females exposed to 0.3, 3, or 30μg/L atrazine during embryogenesis were  identified, respectively. There was a high level of overlap between the  biological processes and molecular pathways in which the altered genes were  associated. Moreover, a subset of genes was down regulated throughout the  serotonergic pathway. These results provide support of the developmental origins  of neurological alterations observed in adult female zebrafish exposed to  atrazine during embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {The dinitrophenol herbicide dinoseb is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Studies in fish demonstrate impaired OXPHOS is  associated with altered immune system responses and locomotor activity in fish.  The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dinoseb on zebrafish  (Danio rerio) during early stages of development. We measured oxygen consumption  rates of embryos, transcripts related to OXPHOS, growth, and the immune system  (cytokines and immune-signaling transcripts), and locomotor activity. We  hypothesized that OXPHOS of fish would be impaired in vivo, leading to altered  basal immune system expression and locomotor activity. Oxidative respiration  assessments in embryos revealed that dinoseb decreased both mean basal  respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration. Expression levels of  cytochrome c oxidase complex IV, 3-hydroxyacyl-COA dehydrogenase and superoxide  dismutase 1 were decreased in larvae following exposure to dinoseb while  succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A, insulin growth factor 1  (igf1) and igf2a mRNA were increased in abundance. Immune-related transcripts  chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) were  decreased in expression levels while toll-like receptor 5a and 5b were increased  in expression. In addition, a visual motor response test was conducted on both 6  and 7 dpf larvae to determine if dinoseb impaired locomotor activity. Dinoseb  decreased locomotor activity in 7 dpf larvae but not 6 dpf. This study improves  knowledge of toxicity mechanisms for dinoseb in early stages of fish development  and demonstrates that mitochondrial toxicants may disrupt immune signaling in  zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroids are commonly used insecticides that are considered to pose little risk to human health. However, there is an increasing concern that children are  more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. We used the zebrafish  model to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to low doses of the  pyrethroid deltamethrin results in persistent alterations in dopaminergic gene  expression, neurochemistry, and locomotor activity. Zebrafish embryos were  treated with deltamethrin (0.25-0.50 μg/l), at concentrations below the LOAEL,  during the embryonic period [3-72 h postfertilization (hpf)], after which  transferred to fresh water until the larval stage (2-weeks postfertilization).  Deltamethrin exposure resulted in decreased transcript levels of the D1 dopamine  (DA) receptor (drd1) and increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase at 72 hpf. The  reduction in drd1 transcripts persisted to the larval stage and was associated  with decreased D2 dopamine receptor transcripts. Larval fish, exposed  developmentally to deltamethrin, had increased levels of homovanillic acid, a DA  metabolite. Since the DA system is involved in locomotor activity, we measured  the swim activity of larval fish following a transition to darkness.  Developmental exposure to deltamethrin significantly increased larval swim  activity which was attenuated by concomitant knockdown of the DA transporter.  Acute exposure to methylphenidate, a DA transporter inhibitor, increased swim  activity in control larva, while reducing swim activity in larva developmentally  exposed to deltamethrin. Developmental exposure to deltamethrin causes locomotor  deficits in larval zebrafish, which is likely mediated by dopaminergic  dysfunction. This highlights the need to understand the persistent effects of  low-dose neurotoxicant exposure during development.},

Copper-based fertilizers and  fungicides have been widely used in agriculture as well. Despite the fact that  copper is an essential element for all biota, elevated concentrations of this  metal have been shown to affect a variety of aquatic organisms. Nonetheless,  comparative studies on the susceptibility of different freshwater species to  copper compounds have seldom been performed. This study was conducted to compare  toxicity of copper-based pesticides (copper oxychloride, cuprous oxide and copper  sulfate) to different freshwater target (Raphidocelis subcapitata, a planktonic  alga and Biomphalaria glabrata, a snail) and non-target (Daphnia similis, a  planktonic crustacean and Danio rerio, a fish) organisms. Test water parameters  were as follows: pH = 7.4 +/- 0.1; hardness 44 +/- 1 mg/l as CaCO3; DO 8-9 mg/l  at the beginning and {\textgreater} 4 mg/l at the end; temperature, fish and snails 25 +/- 1  degrees C, Daphnia 20 +/- 2 degrees C, algae 24 +/- 1 degrees C. D. similis  (immobilization), 48-h EC50s (95\% CLs) ranging from 0.013 (0.011-0.016) to 0.043  (0.033-0.057) mg Cu/l, and R. subcapitata (growth inhibition), 96-h IC50s from  0.071 (0.045-0.099) to 0.137 (0.090-0.174) mg Cu/l, were the most susceptible  species. B. glabrata (lethality), 48-h LC50s from 0.179 (0.102-0.270) to 0.854  (0.553-1.457) mg Cu/l, and D. rerio (lethality), 48-h LC50s 0.063 (0.045-0.089),  0.192 (0.133-0.272) and 0.714 (0.494-1.016) mg Cu/l, were less susceptible than  Daphnia to copper-based pesticides.

In this  study, real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was adapted to  investigate the induction of estrogen-responsive gene expression in embryo-larval  zebrafish after 7 d of exposure to permethrin (PM) enantiomers. The PM  enantiomers were completely separated by a chiral HPLC column. The in vivo study  found that a 7 d exposure to 250 ng L(-1) PM racemate and its enantiomers was  sufficient to stimulate vtg1, esralpha and cyp19b expression, while 1000 ng L(-1)  exposure significantly induced gene expression in a pattern similar to that of  the control (50 ng L(-1) E2), except for vtg2. Significant differences were  detected between the enantiomers in the induction of estrogen-responsive gene  expression. At the exposure level of 1000 ng L(-1), the vtg1, esralpha and cyp19b  responses to the (-)-trans enantiomer were about 3.2-, 1.8- and 1.5-fold higher,  respectively, than those in the group treated with (+)-trans enantiomer (p {\textless}  0.05). In the two cis-enantiomer treatment groups, (+)-cis increased the mRNA  level of the cyp19b gene about 1.5-fold higher than the (-)-cis-enantiomer did.  Of the four enantiomers, the (-)-trans enantiomer showed the greatest estrogenic  activity. The results strongly indicate the occurrence of significant  enantioselectivity in estrogenic activity of PM enantiomers exposed to  embryo-larval zebrafish. These findings add to a growing body of evidence  concerning enantioselectivity in the toxicity, endocrine-disrupting activity, and  environmental biodegradation of chiral pesticides.},

However, research focusing on the ecotoxicity of  this herbicide is limited. The present study employed zebrafish (Danio rerio) as  a model to investigate its developmental toxicity. Embryos were exposed to a  range of concentrations from 0.2 µM to 5 µM starting at late cleavage stage (2 h  postfertilization, [hpf]) or late gastrulation stage (10 hpf). The results showed  that the two exposure strategies had the same minimum teratogenic concentration  of 0.6 µM but caused different groups of morphogenetic malformations. When  exposure was initiated at 2 hpf, clodinafop-propargyl caused various embryonic  phenotypes, including embryos with a fin gap in the ventral tail and embryos with  coiled tail. When exposure was initiated at 10 hpf, clodinafop-propargyl resulted  in failure of the tail to detach, in which the ventral tissues failed to grow out  but instead adhered to the yolk extension, and the defect differed to various  degrees among embryos. Similar effects were observed for embryos exposed to  clodinafop, the metabolite of clodinafop-propargyl. Because these defects were  mainly confined to the posterior and ventral region that derived from ventral  blastoderm cells, we have evaluated the expression of the ventral mesoderm marker  gene gata-1 and ventral ectoderm marker gene gata-3. No significant alteration  was seen in gata-1 expression except for the expanded blood islands, whereas the  expression of gata-3 was significantly reduced. Our findings showed that  clodinafop-propargyl exposure disturbed embryonic patterning and fate  specification of ventrally derived gastrula ectoderm cells.},

The active ingredient in Sevin(™), carbaryl  (1-napthyl-N-methylcarbamate), is a known acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor  that prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine to acetate and choline at the  synapse. While carbaryl successfully causes the death of insects by paralysis, it  has also been shown to have negative effects on the development of several  nontarget species. To study the effects of carbaryl on nontarget species,  zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used, as they are a good model for both toxicology  and development studies. Our study suggests that carbaryl induces changes in  morphology, specifically in embryo size and shape. Additionally, carbaryl causes  defects in heart formation that is characterized by a decrease in heart rate and  a developmental delay/defect in cardiac looping. A significant decrease in the  number of spinal cord neurons present was also observed. Further investigation  showed that there was an increase in cell death in carbaryl-treated embryos. The  results indicate that carbaryl may have a greater environmental impact than  initially intended. Our study, which was conducted solely by undergraduates at a  liberal arts college, indicates that carbaryl may be detrimental to the  development of nontarget species.},

However, the  mechanisms underlying olfactory neurotoxicity are not well characterized,  especially in environmental exposures which involve chemical mixtures. We used  zebrafish to characterize olfactory transcriptional responses by two model  olfactory inhibitors, the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mixtures of CPF with  the neurotoxic metal copper (Cu). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from  olfactory tissues of zebrafish exposed to CPF alone or to a mixture of CPF and  Cu. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis and  hierarchical clustering, whereas gene set analysis was used to identify  biological themes in the microarray data. Microarray results were confirmed by  real-time PCR on genes serving as potential biomarkers of olfactory injury. In  addition, we mined our previously published Cu-induced zebrafish olfactory  transcriptional response database (Tilton et al., 2008) for the purposes of  discriminating pathways of olfaction impacted by either the individual agents or  the CPF-Cu mixture transcriptional signatures. CPF exposure altered the  expression of gene pathways associated with cellular morphogenesis and odorant  binding, but not olfactory signal transduction, a known olfactory pathway for Cu.  The mixture profiles shared genes from the Cu and CPF datasets, whereas some  genes were altered only by the mixtures. The transcriptional signature of the  mixtures was more similar to that in zebrafish exposed to Cu alone than for CPF.  In conclusion, exposure to a mixture containing a common environmental metal and  pesticide causes a unique transcriptional signature that is heavily influenced by  the metal, even when organophosphate predominates.},

Monocrotophos (MCP)  can be rated as moderately toxic to the Zebrafish embryos with a 96-h median  lethal concentration (LC50) of 37.44 ± 3.32 mg/L. In contrast, it greatly  affected the development of zebrafish embryos by inducing several developmental  abnormalities like pericardial edema, altered heart development, spinal and  vertebral anomalies in a concentration-dependent manner. A significant percent  reduction in length by 9-48\% and heart beats by 18-51\% was observed in hatchlings  exposed to LC10 and LC50 concentrations at 96 h when compared to controls. The  process of looping formation of heart at embryonic stage was greatly affected by  the LC50 concentration of MCP. The neurotoxic potentiality of MCP was assessed by  using a marker enzyme, acetylcholinesterase in both in vitro and in vivo  experiments. MCP was found to be the most potent inhibitor of AChE in vitro with  an IC50 value of 4.3 × 10(-4) M. The whole-body AChE enzyme activity in vivo was  significantly inhibited during the exposure tenure with the maximum inhibition of  62\% at 24 h.},

	abstract = {The U.S. EPA frequently uses avian or fish toxicity data to set protective standards for amphibians in ecological risk assessments. However, this approach  does not always adequately represent aquatic-dwelling and terrestrial-phase  amphibian exposure data. For instance, it is accepted that early life stage tests  for fish are typically sensitive enough to protect larval amphibians, however,  metamorphosis from tadpole to a terrestrial-phase adult relies on endocrine cues  that are less prevalent in fish but essential for amphibian life stage  transitions. These differences suggest that more robust approaches are needed to  adequately elucidate the impacts of pesticide exposure in amphibians across  critical life stages. Therefore, in the current study, methodology is presented  that can be applied to link the perturbations in the metabolomic response of  larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a surrogate species frequently used in  ecotoxicological studies, to those of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis)  tadpoles following exposure to three high-use pesticides, bifenthrin,  chlorothalonil, or trifluralin. Generally, D. rerio exhibited greater metabolic  perturbations in both number and magnitude across the pesticide exposures as  opposed to X. laevis. This suggests that screening ecological risk assessment  surrogate toxicity data would sufficiently protect amphibians at the single life  stage studied but care needs to be taken to understand the suite of metabolic  requirements of each developing species. Ultimately, methodology presented, and  data gathered herein will help inform the applicability of metabolomic profiling  in establishing the risk pesticide exposure poses to amphibians and potentially  other non-target species.},

Teratogeny of atrazine  was examined during the first 48 h of zebrafish development (embryo test) and  correlated to effects on the microsomal and soluble glutathione S-transferases  (m-/sGST; EC 2.5.1.18). Atrazine at 4 mg/L disturbed the normal development to  long pec stage, at concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/L it caused retardations  in organogenesis, a slowdown of movements, and functional disturbances of heart  and circulatory system. m- and sGST activities were affected by atrazine in all  investigated developmental stages. Atrazine elevated the mGST activity dose  dependently up to a concentration of 5 mg/L, and the sGST up to 1 mg/L. Higher  atrazine concentrations caused a decrease of GST activity, especially of the sGST  of the younger stages, 32 cells and 75\% epiboly. This might indicate that the  detoxication system itself is affected, which then gives rise to morphological  abnormalities during fish development.

We hypothesized that  NaM-induced transcriptional changes during somitogenesis would reveal the major  molecular targets in the zebrafish embryo. Embryos were exposed to NaM beginning  at 4 hpf (1000 cells) and total RNA was isolated from embryos at the 3 somite (11  hpf), 10 somite (14 hpf), 18 somite (18 hpf), and larval (24 hpf) stages of  development. Using the Affymetrix zebrafish gene array we observed relatively few  mRNAs differentially regulated at least twofold at each time point (11 hpf, 101  genes; 14 hpf, 151; 18 hpf, 154; 24 hpf, 33). The transcriptional profiles reveal  neurodevelopment and myogenesis as the two primary targets of NaM developmental  exposure. Quantitative PCR of several muscle and neuronal genes confirmed the  array response. We also followed the structural development of the peripheral  nervous system under NaM exposure using antibodies against neuronal structural  proteins. Although there was no change in the onset of antibody staining,  profound alterations became apparent during the period in which the notochord  becomes distorted ({\textgreater} 18 hpf). Motor neuron development observed with the  Tg(NBT:MAPT-GFP)zc1 transgenic zebrafish and a primary motor neuron specific  antibody showed similar timing in the structural alterations observed in these  cell types.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphorus pesticide, is known to result in neurotoxicity as well as other metabolic perturbations.  However, the molecular causes of DDVP toxicity are poorly understood, especially  in cells other than neurons and muscle cells. To obtain a better understanding of  the process of non-neuronal DDVP toxicity, we exposed zebrafish to different  concentrations of DDVP, and investigated the resulting changes in liver histology  and gene transcription. RESULTS: Functional enrichment analysis of genes affected  by DDVP exposure identified a number of processes involved in energy utilization  and stress response in the liver. The abundance of transcripts for proteins  involved in glucose metabolism was profoundly affected, suggesting that carbon  flux might be diverted toward the pentose phosphate pathway to compensate for an  elevated demand for energy and reducing equivalents for detoxification.  Strikingly, many transcripts for molecules involved in β-oxidation and fatty acid  synthesis were down-regulated. We found increases in message levels for molecules  involved in reactive oxygen species responses as well as ubiquitination,  proteasomal degradation, and autophagy. To ensure that the effects of DDVP on  energy metabolism were not simply a consequence of poor feeding because of  neuromuscular impairment, we fasted fish for 29 or 50 h and analyzed liver gene  expression in them. The patterns of gene expression for energy metabolism in  fasted and DDVP-exposed fish were markedly different. CONCLUSION: We observed  coordinated changes in the expression of a large number of genes involved in  energy metabolism and responses to oxidative stress. These results argue that an  appreciable part of the effect of DDVP is on energy metabolism and is regulated  at the message level. Although we observed some evidence of neuromuscular  impairment in exposed fish that may have resulted in reduced feeding, the  alterations in gene expression in exposed fish cannot readily be explained by  nutrient deprivation.},

In developing embryos, OPs have been hypothesized to affect  both cholinergic and non-cholinergic pathways. In order to understand the  neurological pathways affected by OP exposure during embryogenesis, we developed  a subacute model of OP developmental exposure in zebrafish by exposing embryos to  a dose of the OP metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) that is non-lethal and  significantly inhibited AChE enzymatic activity compared to control embryos (43\%  at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) and 11\% at 2dpf). Phenotypic analysis of  CPO-exposed embryos demonstrated that embryonic growth, as analyzed by gross  morphology, was normal in 85\% of treated embryos. Muscle fiber formation was  similar to control embryos as analyzed by birefringence, and nicotinic  acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) cluster formation was quantitatively similar to  control embryos as analyzed by α-bungarotoxin staining. These results indicate  that partial AChE activity during the early days of zebrafish development is  sufficient for general development, muscle fiber, and nAChR development.  Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons exhibited aberrant peripheral axon extension and  gene expression profiling suggests that several genes responsible for RB  neurogenesis are down-regulated. Stability of CPO in egg water at 28.5 °C was  determined by HPLC-UV-MS analysis which revealed that the CPO concentration used  in our studies hydrolyzes in egg water with a half-life of 1 day. The result that  developmental CPO exposure affected RB neurogenesis without affecting muscle  fiber or nAChR cluster formation demonstrates that zebrafish are a strong model  system for characterizing subtle neurological pathologies resulting from  environmental toxicants.},

This study  presents a new approach for the investigation of predator-prey interactions  between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired  by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental  design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed,  (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect  by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on  exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 μg/l CHP. Previously, a  decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed.  However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant  differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an  impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP  concentration (1 μg/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were  observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in  higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk  assessment.},

However, in  the male fish, significantly increased vitellogenin concentrations were observed  in the groups exposed to 16 or 64 microg/L prochloraz.

The LC50  for 10-dpf larvae was 1.94 µg L(-1), and these were more sensitive than 20-dpf  larvae (3.56 µg L(-1)). The amount of protein, carbohydrates, and glycogen were  not significantly affected (p {\textgreater} 0.05), but sublethal Cyp concentrations exposure  caused decrement in lipids from 9.05 to 3.74 µg larva(-1), as well as a reduction  in MDA and in the total energy content, which affected significantly the  development of this fish. Although Cyp is considered an insecticide of reduced  residual effect in the environment, the present study revealed that relatively  low Cyp concentrations produced significant toxic effects on exogenous feeding  fish larvae, a situation that could contribute to increase deaths during this  already critical developmental stage in which high mortality is observed  frequently.},

	abstract = {In teleosts, an important component of the stress response is coordinated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis. Environmental contaminants might  disrupt the stress axis and consequently affect the stress response in fish. To  investigate the effect of monocrotophos (MCP) pesticide on the stress response of  fish and its potential mechanisms, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to  0, 1, 10, and 100μg/L of a 40\% MCP-based pesticide for 21d, after which time fish  were subjected to a 3-min air-exposure stressor. Concentrations of the whole-body  cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay and abundances of transcripts of  proteins involved in the HPI axis were determined using quantitative real-time  PCR. Results showed that 100μg/L of MCP pesticide decreased whole-body cortisol  levels of female zebrafish in response to an acute stressor, but without any  effect on the cortisol response in males. 100μg/L MCP pesticide reduced POMC and  GR expression in the brain, MC2R and P45011β expression in the head kidney, but  enhanced 20β-HSD2 expression in the head kidney, suggesting that MCP damaged the  HPI axis involving acting at pituitary regulatory levels, inhibiting cortisol  synthesis and stimulating cortisol catabolism, or disturbing the negative  feedback regulation. Additionally, MCP depressed liver GR transcription but did  not affect phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and tyrosine aminotransferase  expression in zebrafish, suggesting a role for this pesticide in reducing target  tissue responsiveness to cortisol. Considered together, the reduced ability to  elevate cortisol levels in response to an acute stress may be an endocrine  dysfunction occurring in zebrafish subchronically exposed to MCP pesticide.},

	abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is widely regarded as a good biomarker of exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OP). However, less is known about the  relationship between AChE inhibition and consequences for growth, reproduction  and survival on organisms. Acute toxicity tests with fish have shown that high  percentages of AChE inhibition are needed to cause detrimental effects, but not  much is known about the consequences of chronic exposure to this group of  chemicals for both AChE activity and higher levels of biological organisation. In  this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to sublethal concentrations of  the OP parathion for 250 days in a flow-through system. Besides AChE activity, a  variety of other parameters were measured: whole-body protein and lactate  content, consumption rate, survival, growth and reproduction. AChE inhibition was  correlated with exposure concentration, but not with exposure time, and was  significant above 0.9 microg/l after 144 days and above 4.3 microg/l after 250  days of exposure. Both parathion and the cosolvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)  significantly increased food consumption rate of the fish. Survival, growth,  reproduction and lactate content were not affected, while protein concentrations  showed only minor effects. These findings support the hypothesis that AChE is a  very sensitive biomarker for exposure, but not accurately predict higher level  adverse effects following long-term exposure to OPs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate effects of subchronic exposure to sublethal levels of terbutryn on growth and on histopathological  changes in Danio rerio. DESIGN: The acute toxicity tests were performed on the  juvenile stage of Danio rerio according to OECD No. 203 Fish, Acute Toxicity  Test. The juvenile growth tests were performed on D. rerio according to the OECD  method No. 215. Fish at the age of 20 days were exposed to the terbutryn  environmental concentration commonly detected in the Czech rivers (0.02 microg  L-1) and the range of sublethal concentrations of terbutryn (0.06, 0.2, 0.6 and 2  mg L-1) for 28 days. RESULTS: The 96hLC50 terbutryn mean value for the juvenile  stage of D. rerio was 5.71 +/- 0.46 mg L-1. A significant decrease (p {\textless} 0.01) in  the fish growth caused by terbutryn was observed in the concentration of 0.6 mg  L-1. The value of NOEC was 0.2 mg L-1 and LOEC was 0.6 mg L-1 of terbutryn. We  found the damage to tubular system of kidneys in the concentration of 0.6 mg L-1  of terbutryn. CONCLUSION: The environmental concentration of terbutryn in the  Czech rivers did not have any effects on growth and on histopathological changes  in D. rerio and this concentration is lower than determined LOEC and NOEC values  of terbutryn.},

Implementing  transcriptomics may increase sensitivity and objectivity of the test system. We  applied the category approach to compare effects of compounds from two chemical  classes, the glycol ethers and 1,2,4-triazoles, on the embryo. At 24h post  fertilization, microarray analysis revealed several thousands of responsive genes  after glycol ether exposure, whereas the triazoles significantly regulated only  several hundreds of genes. Principal component analysis of the genes commonly  regulated per chemical class demonstrated that the two classes can be  distinguished. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that after glycol ether  exposure mainly gene sets related to development were downregulated. After  triazole exposure, gene sets corresponding to previously described mechanisms of  action, such as glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism were regulated. Our results  demonstrate that transcriptomics in the ZET provides a more sensitive endpoint  than standard morphological assessment. In addition, information about mechanisms  of action of substances may become available, thereby facilitating the  extrapolation of findings to mammalian species including man.},

Its possible teratogenic effects were tested on zebrafish eggs in  four dilutions of decreasing concentration. The average mortality rate was low,  indicating that Sevin does not directly kill embryos at these concentrations.  Eggs and embryos were consistently smaller than the control starting at 24 h  after spawning until hatching. Embryos in the highest concentration took up to  twice as long to hatch as the control. This delayed hatching time increases  vulnerability to predation. In addition, as minnows are lower on the food chain,  bioaccumulation of Sevin in tissues may increase in larger predators, affecting  their metabolism and reproduction.},
