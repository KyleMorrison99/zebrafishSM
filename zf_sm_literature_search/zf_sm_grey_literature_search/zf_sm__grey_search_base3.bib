note = {{ilustraciones, graficas ; La enfermedad de Alzheimer es la demencia m{\'a}s com{\'u}n en la poblaci{\'o}n mundial, tiene una etiolog{\'\i}a desconocida y no cuenta con un tratamiento efectivo. Se caracteriza por la agregaci{\'o}n del p{\'e}ptido amiloide β y Tau hiperfosforilado, aumento de radicales libres, desregulaci{\'o}n lip{\'\i}dica y exitotoxicidad. Teniendo en cuenta esto, los receptores X hep{\'a}ticos, se postulan como una diana terap{\'e}utica, ya que son factores de transcripci{\'o}n que regulan genes encargados de la homeostasis de colesterol y se asocian con mecanismos de eliminaci{\'o}n del p{\'e}ptido amiloide β, una menor fosforilaci{\'o}n de Tau y una menor respuesta inflamatoria, etc. En este trabajo, se cont{\'o} con 82 extractos de Angiospermas basales colombianas, a los que se les evalu{\'o} su actividad agonista sobre los receptores nucleares LXR β, actividad inhibitoria de acetil colinesterasa y actividad antioxidante, seguida de la evaluaci{\'o}n in vivo del efecto protector frente a ambientes t{\'o}xicos de paraquat, ceramida y glutamato.

Adicionalmente, el extracto etan{\'o}lico de Myriticaceae sp.2 y las fracciones de Z. rhoifolium, Z. martinicense y Zanthoxylum sp., mostraron una marcada actividad inhibitoria de AChE.

(texto tomado de la fuente) ; Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease is the most common dementia in the world, has an unknown etiology and d oes not have effective treatment. It is characterized by the aggregation of amyloid peptide β and tau hyperphosphorylation, increased free radicals, lipid deregulation, and excitotoxicity. Considering this, liver X receptors are postulated as a therapeutic target, as they are transcription factors that regulate genes responsible for cholesterol homeostasis and are associated with mechanisms of removal of amyloid peptide β, lower phosphorylation of Tau and lower inflammatory response, etc. In this work, 82 extracts of basal Angiosperms obtained in Colombia were counted, which were evaluated for their agonist activity on LXR β nuclear receptors, continuing with in vitro evaluation of anti-acetylcholinesterase activity and antioxidant activity, followed by in vivo assessment of the protective effect against toxic environments of paraquat, ceramide, and glutamate. Finding that extracts from Z. martinicense, Zanthoxylum sp. Z. rohifolium, N. reticulata, N. membran{\'a}cea, Nectandra sp., Myristicaceae sp. 1 and Myristicaceae sp. 2 have an agonist effect on LXR β, accompanied by antioxidant activity and particularly, the ethanolic extract of Miriticaceae sp.2 and the fractions of Z. rhoifolium, Z. martinicense and Zanthoxylum sp., showed a marked inhibitory activity of AChE and Z. rohifolium, decreases the effect of toxic concentrations of glutamate.

note = {{Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are neuroactive compounds that can affect the development of the nervous system and behavior. Using zebrafish, we compared the effectiveness of three different OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF), diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) on survival, AChE inhibition and larval motility. We conclude that at equimolar concentrations CPF is the most effective OP of the three tested. 300nM CPF inhibited AChE when measured at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) by 80\%, which correlated to a 35\% decrease in larval motility when measured at 6 dpf. We isolated the cDNA of zfkcc2 , which encodes for an important cation-chloride cotransporter responsible for establishing a chloride gradient that allows for the neurotransmitter GABA to become inhibitory for a subset of neurons. By isolating the cDNA of zfkcc2 , we were able to characterize its expression pattern up to 4 dpf. Using qRT-PCR, we showed that the expression of zfkcc2 rises from 2 to 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). The expression of zfkcc2 is found at 1 dpf in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain in a distinct pattern. By 3 dpf, zfkcc2 expression is found throughout most of the developing zebrafish brain. We were then able to characterize the expression pattern of zfnkcc1, which encodes for a cation-chloride cotransporter that works opposite to zfkcc2 and establishes a chloride gradient allowing GABA to be excitatory during development. Expression of zfnkcc1 is found at 1 dpf throughout most of the developing zebrafish head including in some non-neural tissue, but appears concentrated to the otic vesicle at 3 dpf. Using double in situ hybridization, we investigated the nature of the developmental switch from zfnkcc1 to zfkcc2 by looking at regions where there was an interaction between both genes{\textquoteright} expression patterns in the developing zebrafish nervous system. We preliminarily examined how affecting nicotinic signaling with exposures to nicotinic agonists/antagonists can affect the expression of zfnkcc2 and zfkcc2 . While there were no apparent changes in the expression pattern from any of the exposures at 2 dpf, we found that by 3 dpf nicotine and CPF exposures resulted in an incomplete expression pattern for zfkcc2 that seemed to be delayed. However, the expression of zfnkcc1 at the otic vesicle was unaffected by exposure. Our results suggest that disrupting nicotinic signaling during development can affect the expression of an important cation-chloride cotransporter, zfkcc2 , that plays a major role in establishing the necessary chloride gradient for the proper functioning of GABA during development. Future studies should focus on investigating the nature of the developmental switch between zfnkcc1 and zfkcc2 to see if the possibility of their regulation being coupled is a target for exposures.}},

The objectives of this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to zebrafish embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities, oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the Visual Motor Response test.

Zebrafish larvae exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using the Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf embryos at 20 mu M after a 24-hour exposure.

note = {{Metolachlor herbicides are derived from the chloroacetamide chemical family of which there are the Sand Rmetolachlor isomers. S-metolachlor is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 mu M) over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 mu M and above. Exposure levels as high as 200 mu M for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim bladder inflation at 50 mu M in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish exposed to 50 mu M while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance, corresponding to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response test revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 mu M) resulted in hypo activity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship between surface area of the swim bladder and distance traveled, and the size of the swim bladder explained similar to 10-14\% in the variation for total distance moved. Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test, and we did not detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration tested. Here we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure to the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may disrupt transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and morphology, which could ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity. These data are expected to contribute to further risk assessment guidelines for S-metolachlor in aquatic ecosystems.}},

note = {{Metolachlor herbicides are derived from the chloroacetamide chemical family of which there are the Sand Rmetolachlor isomers. S-metolachlor is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 mu M) over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 mu M and above. Exposure levels as high as 200 mu M for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim bladder inflation at 50 mu M in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a).
