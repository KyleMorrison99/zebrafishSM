The insecticide fipronil and herbicide 2,4-D stand out among the most commonly used pesticides and, therefore, environmental consequences are a matter of concern. The present study aimed to investigate the toxicity mechanisms of Regent (R) 800 WG (a.i. fipronil) and DMA (R) 806 BR (a.i. 2,4-D) pesticides using forced and non-forced exposures through an integrative approach: firstly, to assess whether contamination by fipronil and 2,4-D can trigger the avoidance behavior of the fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Hyphessobrycon eques (serpae tetra or mato-grosso). Additionally, the effects on fish were analyzed considering the swimming behavior together with a biomarker of neurotoxicity, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In avoidance tests with pesticide gradients, D. rerio avoided the highest concentrations of the two compounds and H. eques avoided only the highest concentration of 2,4-D. The swimming behavior (distance moved) was reduced and AChE was inhibited when D. rerio was exposed to fipronil. The 2,4-D affected the swimming (maximum speed) of H. eques, but AChE was not altered.Avoidance response seemed not to have been affected by possible effects of contaminants on swimming behavior and Ache activity. This study showed the importance of knowing the avoidance capacity, swimming behavior and neurotoxic effects of pesticides on fish in an integrated and realistic context of exposure in environments contaminated with pesticides and can be useful as ecologically relevant tools for ecological risk assessment.

Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that has been increasingly used in agriculture. However, there are few data about its effects on non-target organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of propiconazole in zebrafish. The animals were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of propiconazole (425, 850, 1700, 8500 ng/L), then submitted to the novel tank test for behavioral analyses. The brains were collected for evaluation of oxidative stress parameters. Exposure to propiconazole (1700 and 8500 ng/L) decreased the number of crossings, entries, and time spent in the top, and increased the time spent in the bottom area of the tank. We also observed an increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in zebrafish brain exposed to propiconazole at 425, 850, and 1700 ng/L. We conclude that propiconazole alters normal fish behavior and disrupts oxidative status. More studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the effects of propiconazole on non-target-organisms.","","10.1007/s11356-019-05977-3","Oxidative Stress",NA,NA

The hypothesis was to test whether D. iguape has a metabolism similar to Danio rerio so that its use in bioassays may be validated. Lethal concentration (LC50) and metabolic rates were studied in fish exposed to propiconazole. Specific oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion for D. iguape and D. rerio increased by 0.01 mu g L-1 and then decreased as the propiconazole concentration increased. The decrease in the averages of specific oxygen consumption at the concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1 represented a reduction in the metabolic rate compared to the control of 71\% for D. iguape and 40\% D. rerio. For the ammonia excretion, at the same concentration, there was a reduction of 68.7\% and 45.4\% for D. iguape and D. rerio, respectively. When comparing ammonia excretion of the two species for each concentration of propiconazole, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in relation to the control and for the highest concentration (0.1 mu g L-1). As for specific oxygen consumption, there was a statistically significant difference only for the concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1.

Domoic acid poisoning, previously recognized in adult animals, is now  viewed as a major cause of prenatal mortality. The appearance of a chronic  juvenile domoic acid disease in the sea lions, characterized by behavioral  abnormalities and epilepsy, is consistent with early life poisoning and may be  potentiated by organochlorine burden. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the interactive  effect of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on neurodevelopment using a  zebrafish (Danio rerio) model for seizure behavior to examine the susceptibility  to domoic acid-induced seizures after completion of neurodevelopment. METHODS:  Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to either o,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE  (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) during neurodevelopment via a 0.1\% dimethyl  sulfoxide solution. These larval (7 days postfertilization) fish were then  exposed to either the seizure-inducing drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or domoic  acid; resulting seizure behavior was monitored and analyzed for changes using  cameras and behavioral tracking software. RESULTS: Embryonic exposure to DDTs  enhanced PTZ seizures and caused distinct and increased seizure behaviors to  domoic acid, most notably a type of head-shaking behavior. CONCLUSION: These  studies demonstrate that embryonic exposure to DDTs leads to asymptomatic animals  at completion of neurodevelopment with greater sensitivity to domoic acid-induced  seizures. The body burden levels of p,p'-DDE are close to the range recently  found in fetal California sea lions and suggest a potential interactive effect of  p,p'-DDE embryonic poisoning and domoic acid toxicity.","","10.1289/ehp.11685","DDT;Animals;Danio rerio;California;zebrafish;Body Burden;domoic acid;Sea Lions;DDT/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity;*Environmental Exposure;Zebrafish/*embryology;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*pharmacokinetics;Fetus/*metabolism;Kainic Acid/*analogs \& derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity;seizures;Seizures/*chemically induced;Seizures",NA,NA

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

Several endpoints, such as swimming behaviour, morphological abnormalities and mortality, were studied. In addition, the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was investigated in order to evaluate the mode of action and toxicity of chlorpyrifos in the presence of these herbicides. Results indicate that both binary mixtures elicited synergistic responses on the swimming behaviour of zebrafish larvae. Moreover, although the herbicides were not effective inhibitors of the AChE on their own, a synergistic inhibition of the enzyme activity was obtained by exposure to mixtures with chlorpyrifos. We observed a correlation between impairment of swimming behaviour of the larvae and inhibition of AChE activity. This study supports previous studies concerning the risk assessment of mixtures since the toxicity may be underestimated when looking only at the single toxicants and not their mixtures.","","10.1007/s11356-012-1443-6","",NA,NA

Zebrafish exposed to 3 and 5 mg/L of GBH spend more time in the top zone and less time in the bottom zone. Fish exposed to 0.009 and 0.018 mg/L of FBI spent less time in the bottom zone, whereas zebrafish exposed to the three GBH + FBI mixtures spend more time in the top zone compared with unexposed control fish.

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoles at environmentally relevant and high concentrations, 0.3, 1.0, and 1000 mu g/L, starting at 5 h postfertilization (hpf) up to 48 hpf, as well as 5 d postfertilization (dpf). Relative mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 family 51 lanosterol-14 alpha-demethylase, glutathione S-transferase, caspase 9, phosphoprotein p53, and BCL2-associated X protein were measured to assess toxicity attributable to fungicides at the mRNA level, whereas caspase 3/7 (apoptosis) and 3,4-methylene dioxy amphetamine (lipid peroxidation) levels were measured at the enzymatic level. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was measure through the Mito Stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 at 48 hpf. In addition, light to dark movement behavior was monitored at 5 dpf using Danio Vision (R) to understand adverse effects at the organismal level. There was no significant difference in the light to dark behavior with exposure to azoles compared to controls. The molecular biomarkers indicated that propiconazole and myclobutanil induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and potentially apoptosis at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 1 mu g/L). The results from the mitochondrial respiration assay indicated a slight decrease in spare respiratory capacity with an acute exposure (48 hpf) to all 3 azoles at 1000 mu g/L.

With the zebrafish model, we examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 mu M CPF), with short- and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity, tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at 14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses. Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at 14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point. These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a lowcost model that has a variety of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2019.106853","Adult",NA,NA

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of propiconazole during zebrafish development. Wildtype zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to propiconazole (0.1-100 mu M) for up to 150 hours post fertilization (hpf) depending upon the endpoint measured. Propiconazole decreased survival and induced hypopigmentation in fish at 100 mu M compared to the water and solvent controls. Pericardial edema was also noted in embryos and larvae (beginning at 2-3 dpf) exposed to 100 mu M propiconazole. To visualize the effects of propiconazole on the circulatory system in more detail, we exposed transgenic zebrafish (globin-LCR:eGFP) to the fungicide. Hematopoietic changes were observed within 48 h of exposure to 100 mu M and localization of blood cells in the cardic region became diffuse, indicating pooling of blood in the pericardial region. We measured oxidative respiration in embryos as sufficient ATP is needed for development. Exposure to 100 mu M propiconazole (similar to 6-30 hpf) reduced basal respiration (similar to 50\%), oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration (similar to 70\%), proton leak (similar to 30\%), and non-mitochondrial respiration (similar to 50\%), indicating compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. A Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was used to measure dark photokinesis behavior in larval fish exposed to propiconazole for a 6-day period. Larval fish exposed to the highest concentration in the assay (10 mu M) showed evidence of hypoactivity. This study demonstrates that propiconazole can induce hypopigmentation in zebrafish, disrupt mitochondrial bioenergetics, and can alter locomotor activity. However, these sub-lethal responses were observed at concentrations above what is typically detected in the environment.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2019.106809","Triazoles;Motor Activity;Ventilators, Mechanical;Respiration",NA,NA

To address this knowledge gap, we exposed the euryhaline model species Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to the insecticide bifenthrin, a known modulator of calcium signaling. The main objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether exposure of developing silversides to environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin alters their behavior; and (2) whether behavioral changes correlate with altered expression of genes involved in RyR and mTOR-dependent signaling pathways. At six hours post fertilization (hpf), inland silversides were exposed to bifenthrin at 3, 27 and 122 ng/L until 7 days post fertilization (dpf, larvae hatched at 6dpf), followed by a 14-day recovery period in uncontaminated water. Transcriptional responses were measured at 5, 7 and 21 dpf; locomotor behavior following external stimuli and response to an olfactory predator cue were assessed at 7 and 21 dpf. Bifenthrin elicited significant non-monotonic transcriptional responses in the majority of genes examined at 5 dpf and at 21 dpf. Bifenthrin also significantly altered predator avoidance behavior via olfactory mechanisms with main effects identified for animals exposed to 3 and 27 ng/L. Behavioral effects were not detected in response to visual stimuli during acute exposure, but were significant in the predator-cue assessment following the recovery period, suggesting delayed and long-term effects of early developmental exposures to bifenthrin. Our findings demonstrate that at picomolar (pM) concentrations, which are often not represented in ecotoxi-cological studies, bifenthrin perturbs early development of inland silversides. These developmental impacts are manifested behaviorally at later life stages, specifically as altered patterns of predator avoidance behavior, which have been correlated with population decline. Collectively, these data suggest that bifenthrin may be negatively impacting wild fish populations.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.10.014","Environmental Exposure;Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel;Prednisolone",NA,NA

Neuronal calcium oscillations are influenced by ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity, which modulates calcium-dependent signaling cascades, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. RyR activity and mTOR signaling play critical roles in regulating neurodevelopmental processes. However, whether environmentally relevant levels of bifenthrin alter RyR or mTOR signaling pathways to influence neurodevelopment has not been addressed.

The insecticide/acaricide abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole are the main pesticides that are intensively used in Brazilian strawberry crop and are hence likely to occur simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the lethal and sublethal toxicity of single and mixture exposures of these pesticides to zebrafish early life stages (embryos and juveniles). By comparing the derived toxicity data of the individual compounds with that previously determined for zebrafish adults, the order of life stage sensitivity was juvenile > adult> embryo. The pesticide mixture revealed a dose-level dependent deviation of the independent action model, with antagonism at low dose levels and synergism at high dose levels. Sublethal parameters (especially those related with locomotion) were considerably more sensitive than lethality. Subsequently, the inclusion of sublethal parameters may greatly improve the sensitivity of FET tests and hence its suitability as a substitution of adult fish testing in risk assessment evaluations.

To answer this question, adult zebrafish were tested in a chamber that allows fish to escape from or seek a lane of contaminated water. This attraction and aversion paradigm was evaluated with zebrafish in the presence of an acute contamination with these compounds. We showed that only GBH was aversive to fish, whereas ABH and TBF caused neither attraction nor aversion for zebrafish. Thus, these chemicals do not impose an extra toxic risk by being an attractant for fish, although TBF and ABH can be more deleterious, because they induce no aversive response.

Furthermore, salinity intrusion in the SFBD is exacerbated by global climate change, which may change the dynamics of pyrethroid toxicity on aquatic animals. Therefore, examining the effect of salinity on the sublethal toxicity of pyrethroids is essential for risk assessments, especially during the early life stages of estuarine fishes. To address this, we investigated behavioral effects of permethrin and bifenthrin at three environmentally relevant concentrations across a salinity gradient (0.5, 2 and 6 PSU) on Delta Smelt yolk-sac larvae. Our results suggest that environmentally relevant concentrations of pyrethroids can perturb Delta Smelt larvae behavior even at the lowest concentrations (<1 ng/L) and that salinity can change the dynamic of pyrethroid toxicity in terms of behavioral effects, especially for bifenthrin, where salinity was positively correlated with anti-thigmotaxis at each concentration.","","10.3390/toxics9020040","",NA,NA

Considerable research has characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at 14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses, anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach, predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not 3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing responses in the predator test showed fleeenhancing effects of both compounds individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2021.106985","",NA,NA

Fipronil is an agricultural pesticide that inhibits gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) gated chloride channels. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 48 h (starting at similar to 3 h post fertilization, hpf) to various concentrations of fipronil (0.02 mu g/L up to 4000 mu g/L). Following this acute exposure, a subset of fish was transferred to clean water for a 7-day depuration phase. We hypothesized that a pulse exposure to fipronil during critical periods of central nervous system development would adversely affect fish later in life. After a 48 hour pulse exposure, survival was reduced in embryos exposed to 2 mu g fipronil/L or greater. However, there was no further mortality during the depuration phase, nor were there changes in body length nor notochord length in larvae 9 dpf (days post-fertilization) compared to controls. Additional experiments were carried out at higher concentrations over 96 h (up to 4 dpf) to also elucidate developmental effects and teratogenicity of fipronil (43.7 mu g/L up to 4370 mu g/L). Fipronil at these higher concentrations significantly impacted the development of zebrafish, and the following morphometric and teratogenic effects were observed in 4 dpf fish; reduced body length, yolk sac and pericardial edema, reduced midbrain length, reduced optic and otic diameter, and truncation of the lower jaw. In depurated fish, we hypothesized that there would exist residual effects of exposure at the molecular level. Transcriptome profiling was therefore conducted on 9 dpf depurated larvae exposed initially for 48 h to one dose of either 0.2 mu g/L, 200 mu g/L or 2000 mu g/L fipronil. The expression of gene networks associated with glycogen and omega-3-fatty acid metabolism were decreased in larvae exposed to each of the three concentrations of fipronil, suggesting metabolic disruption. Moreover, transcriptomics revealed that fipronil suppressed gene networks related to light-dark adaptation, photoperiod sensing, and circadian rhythm. Based on these data, we tested fish for altered behavioral responses in a Light-Dark preference test. Larvae exposed to > 200 mu g fipronil/L as embryos showed fewer number of visits (20-30\% less) to the dark zone compared to controls. Larvae also spent a lower amount of time in the dark zone compared to controls, suggesting that fipronil strengthened dark avoidance behavior which is indicative of anxiety. This study demonstrates that a short pulse exposure to fipronil can affect transcriptome networks for metabolism, circadian rhythm, and response to light in fish after depuration, and these molecular responses are hypothesized to be related to aberrant behavioral effects observed in the light-dark preference test.","","10.1016/j.cbd.2020.100743","Pesticides",NA,NA

We measured biomarkers at sub-individual (cellular) and individual (metabolism, behavior) levels and examined relationships among these responses.

Exposure to ethoprophos modified antipredator behaviors such as escape response and detection avoidance (light/dark preference): exposed fish escaped slower from a simulated attack and preferred brighter areas in a novel tank. The relationship between ChE activity and reaction time suggests that pesticide-induced ChE inhibition reduces escape ability in fish.

Concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mu g/L esfenvalerate did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in zebrafish, but there was an acceleration in hatching time for zebrafish exposed to 2 mu g/L esfenvalerate. As an indicator of neurotoxicity, the Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was conducted with 5, 6, and 7 dpf zebrafish after continuous exposure, and higher concentrations were used (4 and 8 mu g/L esfenvalerate) to better discern age-and dose dependent responses in behavior. Experiments revealed that, unlike the other stages, 6 dpf larvae showed evidence for hypo-activity with esfenvalerate, suggesting that different stages of larval development may show increased sensitivity to pyrethroid exposure. This may be related to age-dependent maturation of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that reduced larval activity may be associated with impaired production of ATP and the function of mitochondria at earlier life stages, however dramatic alterations in oxidative phosphorylation were not observed. Based on evidence that dopamine regulates behavior and studies showing that other pyrethroids affect dopamine system, we measured transcripts involved in dopaminergic signaling. We found that dopamine active transporter was down-regulated with 0.2 mu g/L esfenvalerate. Lastly, we comprehensively summarize the current literature (>20 studies) regarding the toxicity of pyrethroids in zebrafish, which is a valuable resource to those studying these pesticides. This study demonstrates that esfenvalerate at environmentally-relevant levels induces hypoactivity that are dependent upon the age of the zebrafish, and these behavioral changes are hypothesized to be related to impaired dopamine signaling.

Despite the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen (Pestanal(R)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However, there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to control or vehicle. However,grandcrfgene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups. Taken together, these findings indicate that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive impairment and altered cortisol levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.","","10.3389/fnbeh.2020.00103","Hydrocortisone;Cognition",NA,NA

Consequently, early-life exposure to such insecticides can disturb these processes, resulting in an impaired nervous system. One test frequently used to assess developmental neurotoxicity is the zebrafish light-dark transition test, which measures larval locomotion as a response to light changes. However, it is only poorly understood which structural alterations cause insecticide-induced locomotion defects and how persistent these alterations are. Therefore, this study aimed to link locomotion defects with effects on neuromuscular structures, including motorneurons, synapses, and muscles, and to investigate the longevity of the effects. The cholinergic insecticides diazinon and dimethoate (organophosphates), methomyl and pirimicarb (carbamates), and imidacloprid and thiacloprid (neonicotinoids) were used to induce hypoactivity. Our analyses revealed that some insecticides did not alter any of the structures assessed, while others affected axon branching (methomyl, imidacloprid) or muscle integrity (methomyl, thiacloprid). The majority of effects, even structural, were reversible within 24 to 72 h. Overall, we find that both neurodevelopmental and non-neurodevelopmental effects of different longevity can account for the reduced locomotion.

To investigate the reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids, homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were conducted to explore the interaction between pyrethroids and ER alpha from atomic scale.

In addition, heat maps and the speed and distance of the swimming trajectory were compared between zebrafish subjected to the sham and fipronil treatments. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted separately to compare expressions of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurotoxicity related proteins in the brain tissue between adult zebrafish with sham and fipronil treatments.

The duration of hyperactivity was almost 50 min in the deltamethrin exposure test and only 15 min in the Cd exposure test. A positive linear correlation was detected between variation in speed and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in deltamethrin exposure (p<0.01, r(2)=0.7103), while no correlation was detected for Cd exposure (p>0.05, r(2)=0.0646). After 20 min exposure, zebrafish exposed to Cd stayed near the bottom but surfaced more frequently to deltamethrin. Swimming depth increased by 61.98\% from 139.92 mm to 226.24 mm in deltamethrin exposure, but decreased by 92.16\% from 161.26 mm to 83.92 mm in Cd exposure. Our results suggest that those type-specific characters may attribute to the different mode of action of chemicals studied. The increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level and glutathione (GSH) concentration in tissues showed that toxicity was mainly in the gill following deltamethrin exposure but in the liver following Cd exposure. Speed and turning frequency under both exposures decreased significantly, even lower than the control group, which indicated a possible energy reallocation from locomotion to detoxification processes. Behavioral toxicity classifications provide another tool that may be used to help separate chemicals according to mode of action, which can contribute to the development of a biological early warning system for detecting toxicants at early stages of pollution.","","","Biological Markers",NA,NA

FET was performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 1600 mu g.L-1 of formulated Regent(R) 800WG. Adults were exposed to 0.2, 2 and 20 mu g.L-1 of the product for 24 and 96 h, and were submitted to the light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance tests No lethal parameters were observed in larvae, but in concentrations above 400 mu g.L-1, there was shortening of the body axis and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.","","10.1007/s10646-021-02497-0","",NA,NA

We found that, although beta-endosulfan did not significantly affect the growth of zebrafish, it greatly decreased the hatching rate, even at a concentration as low as 10 ng/L. Interestingly, the decrease of the hatching rate was highly correlated with pathological alterations of the testes.

OP exposures (5 hpf - 120 dpf) on embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) were assessed using a larval zebrafish behavior assay at concentrations: 0.01, 0.1, 10, and 100 mu g/L. Individual OPs had varying degrees of neurotoxicity. Significant hypoactivity was observed in the 100 mu g/L treatments for diazinon and malathion (p < 0.05) as compared to the controls. Diazinon-exposed larvae exhibited a 26\% locomotor decrease, and hypoactivity was observed in malathion-exposed larvae at a reduction of 22\% and 29\% for distance traveled and velocity, respectively. Gene regulation and enzymatic activity changes were measured for both 0.1 and 100 mu g/L exposures across OP treatments. Increased CES activity was observed for the 0.1 mu g/L treatments of diazinon and methyl-parathion as well as the 100 mu g/L treatment of dichlorvos; meanwhile, decreased CES activity was observed for 100 mu g/L treatments of diazinon and malathion. Relative enzymatic activity of AChE was inhibited as compared to the control for the 0.1 mu g/L diazinon. No other treatment group exhibited a significant effect on biochemical AChE activity; however, AChE upregulation was observed in the 0.1 mu g/L exposure for diazinon, dichlorvos, and malathion. Methyl-parathion was observed to downregulate c-Fos at 0.1 mu g/L exposure. Malathion upregulated LINGO-1B at 100 mu g/L, a gene associated with neuronal regeneration; meanwhile, downregulation of LINGO-1B was observed for 0.1 mu g/L exposure of methyl-parathion. Additional downregulation was observed for GRIN-1B in the 100 mu g/L diazinon, 100 mu g/L dichlorvos, and 0.1 mu g/L methyl-parathion treatments. Exposure of ZF embryos to independent concentrations of 100 mu g/L concentrations of diazinon and malathion resulted in hypoactivity and decreased CES activity at 5 dfp. No changes in swimming behavior were observed for either the 0.1 mu g/L or 100 mu g/L dichlorvos or methyl-parathion treatments. Observations from this study indicate that AChE inhibition may not be the most sensitive biomarker of OP pesticide exposure in zebrafish. Rather, the enzyme CES demonstrated higher sensitivity as a biomarker of OP toxicity.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2019.04.002","Organophosphates",NA,NA

These same sea lions accumulate a mixture of persistent environmental  contaminants including pesticides and industrial products such as polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Developmental  exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its stable  metabolite 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p -DDE) has been shown  to enhance domoic acid-induced seizures in zebrafish; however, the contribution  of other co-occurring contaminants is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We formulated a mixture  of contaminants to include PCBs, PBDEs, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and  chlordane at levels matching those reported for fetal CSL blubber to determine  the impact of co-occurring persistent contaminants with p,p -DDE on chemically  induced seizures in zebrafish as a model for the CSLs. METHODS: Embryos were  exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to p,p -DDE in the presence or absence of a  defined contaminant mixture prior to neurodevelopment via either bath exposure or  embryo yolk sac microinjection. After brain maturation (7 days  postfertilization), fish were exposed to a chemical convulsant, either  pentylenetetrazole or domoic acid; resulting seizure behavior was then monitored  and analyzed for changes, using cameras and behavioral tracking software.  RESULTS: Induced seizure behavior did not differ significantly between subjects  with embryonic exposure to a contaminant mixture and those exposed to p,p -DDE  only. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that p,p -DDE--in the absence of  PCBs, HCH, chlordane, and PBDEs that co-occur in fetal sea lions--accounts for  the synergistic activity that leads to greater sensitivity to domoic acid  seizures.","","10.1289/ehp.0901301","Animals;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;Zebrafish;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*toxicity;Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity;Hexachlorocyclohexane/toxicity;Disease Models;Animal;Seizures/*chemically induced;Fetus/drug effects;Kainic Acid/*analogs \& derivatives/toxicity;California;Seizures",20368122,NA

In this paper, we designed a study to investigate the single and combined effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) and the triazole fungicide difenoconazole on zebrafish, and to explore the mechanism of this effect. The results showed that PS-MPs could reduce the bioaccumulation of difenoconazole in zebrafish to a certain extent and alleviate the oxidative stress damage of difenoconazole in the zebrafish liver. The transcriptome and qRT-PCR data revealed the association of multiple pathways in the difenoconazole response, while the presence of PS-MPs ameliorated this effect in gene expression changes. Due to the properties of PS-MPs and the interaction between them, the toxic effect of difenoconazole when combined with PS-MPs is more prominent.

Coumarin 47 is commonly found in personal care products and dyes, whereas permethrin is used as a domestic and agricultural pyrethroid insecticide/insect repellent. Zebrafish (F0) were exposed during early development until 28 days post-fertilization and their progeny (F1-F3) were bred unexposed.

During evolution, they have developed different anti-predator behaviours, as the vibrational-evoked startle response and its habituation, for promoting survival to predator's strikes. Whereas these two behaviours can be altered by the exposure to some neurotoxicants, it is currently unknown if the exposure to environmentally relevant concentration (ERC) of neurotoxic pollutants could impair them. In this study thirty neurotoxic environmental pollutants from nine chemical groups, including: herbicides: carbamate, organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides; toxins; metal and non-metal elements, have been screened at two concentrations, including one environmental relevant concentration (ERC), for adverse effects on anti-predator behaviours by using the Vibrational Startle Response Assay on zebrafish larvae. Significant effects over anti-predator responses were equally observed in both exposure concentrations. Focusing on the ERC scenario, it was found that the startle response was the less affected behaviour, where ten pollutants from all chemical groups except for organochlorine, neonicotinoid and pyrethroids, altered this response. Interestingly, organic and inorganic pollutants showed opposite effects on this response: whereas all organic pollutants decreased the startle response, the three remaining inorganic pollutants increased it. On the other hand, more pollutants affected habituation of the startle response of the larvae, where thirteen of the pollutants from all groups, except for herbicides, altered this behaviour at ERC, generally resulting in a faster habituation except for one OP and one marine toxin, which were able to delay this response. Ultimately, only one chemical from the OP, toxin, metal and non-metal element groups altered both the startle response and its habituation at both ERC and WSC.

Firstly, guppies were exposed to an atrazine gradient in a non-forced exposure system, in which organisms moved freely among the concentrations, to assess their ability to avoid atrazine. Secondly, a chemical barrier formed by atrazine, separating two clean habitats (extremities of the non-forced system), was simulated to assess whether the presence of the contaminant could prevent guppies from migrating to the other side of the system. Fish were able to avoid atrazine contamination at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.02 mu g L-1), below those described to cause sub-lethal effects. The AC(50) (atrazine concentration causing avoidance to 50\% of the population) was 0.065 mu g L-1. The chemical barrier formed by atrazine at 150 mu g L-1 (concentration that should produce an avoidance around 82\%) caused a reduction in the migratory potential of the fish by 47\%; while the chemical barrier at 1058 mu g L-1 (concentration that produces torpidity) caused a reduction in the migratory potential of the fish by 91\%. Contamination by atrazine, besides driving the spatial distribution of fish populations, has potential to act as a chemical barrier by isolating fish populations.

Locomotor and anxiety behavior were investigated, together with transcriptomic and epigenomic (DNA methylation) changes in brains. Permethrin exposed F0 fish were hypoactive at adulthood, while males from the F1 and F2 generations showed a specific decrease in anxiety-like behavior. In F0, transcriptomic data showed enrichment in pathways related to glutamatergic synapse activity, which may partly underlie the behavioral effects. In F1 and F2 males, dysregulation of similar pathways was observed, including a subset of differentially methylated regions that were inherited from the F0 to the F2 generation and indicated stable dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling. Altogether, the present results provide novel evidence on the transgenerational neurotoxic effects of permethrin, as well as mechanistic insight: a transient exposure induces persistent transcriptional and DNA methylation changes that may translate into transgenerational alteration of glutamatergic signaling and, thus, into behavioral alterations.

The vitamin C supplement significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity of insecticide mixture and oxidative stress. This study provides possible in vivo evidence to show that vitamin C supplements could attenuate oxidative stress and brain damage of fipronil and pyriproxyfen insecticide chronic exposure on zebrafish juvenile.","","10.3390/antiox9100944","Vitamin D;Vitamin U;Riboflavin;Vitamin A;Biotin;Folic Acid;Vitamin B Complex;Vitamin E;Oxidative Stress;Arachidonic Acid;Vitamins;Ascorbic Acid",NA,NA

Our goal was to identify the potential of contaminants to trigger the avoidance response in fish and detect any changes to that response resulting from binary mixtures. Avoidance was assessed for three hours using an open gradient system with six levels of increasing concentrations. Fish avoided environmentally relevant concentrations of the three compounds. The avoidance of CPF {[}AC50 = 7.95 (3.3-36.3) mu g/L] and CTL {[}AC50 = 3.41 (1.2-41.6) mu g/L] was evident during the entire period of observation.

The avoidance recorded using CPF and CTL alone was attenuated by the presence of Gly. Applying an additive concentration model, Gly initially acted synergistically with the other two compounds, although this interaction was not observed during the later period.

This study aims to assess short-term toxicity of rotenone to early-life stages of the fish Danio rerio and Poecilia reticulata using a wide and integrative range of biomarkers (developmental, biochemical, behavioral, and histopathological). Moreover, the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach was used to compare rotenone acute toxicity to fish species. Toxicity tests were based on the OECD protocols, fish embryo toxicity test (for D. rerio embryos), and fish acute toxicity test (for P. reticulata juveniles). D. rerio embryos were used to estimate lethal concentrations and analyze embryonic and enzymatic alterations (activity of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cholinesterase), while P. reticulata juveniles were used for the assessment of histological damage in the gills and liver. Rotenone induced significant mortality in zebrafish embryos with a 96-h lethal concentration 50 \% (LC50) = 12.2 mu g/L. Rotenone was embryotoxic, affecting the development of D. rerio embryos, which showed cardiac edema; tail deformities; loss of equilibrium; and a general delay characterized by lack of tail detachment, delayed somite formation, yolk sac absorption, and lack of pigmentation. Biochemical biomarker inhibition was observed for concentrations >= 1 mu g/L for CAT and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and for cholinesterase (ChE) in concentration from 10 mu g/L. Behavioral changes were observed for P. reticulata juveniles exposed to concentrations equal to or above 25 mu g/L of rotenone; moreover, histological damage in the liver and gills of fish exposed to concentrations equal to or above 2.5 mu g/L could be observed. A hazard concentration 5 \% (HC5) of 3.2 mu g/L was estimated considering the acute toxicity data for different fish species (n = 49). Lethal and sublethal effects of rotenone raise a concern about its effects on nontarget fish species, especially because rotenone and its metabolite rotenolone are frequently reported in the microgram range in natural environments for several days after field applications. Rotenone should be used with caution. Given the high toxicity and wide range of sublethal effects here reported, further studies in a chronic exposure scenario are recommended.","","10.1007/s11356-015-4596-2","",NA,NA

To date, few investigations have focused on the genomic mechanisms responsible for the enantioselective toxicity of chiral pesticides. The epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, caused by the pesticides are also blind spot of the research works. Video tracking showed that R-fipronil exhibited more intense neurotoxicity, as well as the induction of more severe anxiety-like behavior, such as boosted swimming speed and dysregulated photoperiodic locomotion, to embryonic and larval zebrafish compared with S-fipronil. The MeDIP-Seq analysis, combined with Gene Ontology and KEGG, revealed that R-fipronil disrupted five signaling pathways (MAPK, Calcium signaling, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Purine metabolism, and Endocytosis) to a greater extent than S-fipronil through the hypermethylation of several important neuro-related genes, whereas no significant alterations of global DNA methylation were observed on the two enantiomers. To summarize, our data indicated that the fipronil-conducted enantioselective neurotoxicity likely applied its enantioselectivity by the dysregulation of DNA methylation. Our study also provided novel epigenetic insights into the study of enantioselective biological effects and the relevant underlying mechanisms of chiral insecticide. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the effect of cypermethrin on the embryonic stages of zebrafish is well characterized, its toxic effect on the behaviour of adult zebrafish is largely unknown. Here we used videogram and automated tracking approach to quantitatively assess behavioural toxicity induced by the short exposure of cypermethrin to adult zebrafish. We observed that cypermethrin at 25ppb level induced behavioural toxicity in adult zebrafish. Motor activity of the treated group was significantly retarded which affected their overall exploratory behaviour including their visit to the central arena of the open-field test. Furthermore, the treated group showed erratic movements (covered less distance per unit time) without affecting their angle based behavioural endpoints. In contrast to the control group, the cypermethrin exposed group showed frequent freezing behaviour. However, their freezing episodes were characterized by constant drift-like movement caused by the loss of their voluntary control over the motor coordination. These behavioural changes are similar to typical anxiety-like behaviour. Though, cypermethrin exposure at ppb level for just half an hour was sufficient to induce behavioural toxicity, it failed to alter brain superoxide dismutase and acetylcholine esterase enzyme activity. Our data indicates that acute short-term exposure of cypermethrin induces behavioural anomalies in adult zebrafish through a mechanism distinct from alteration of brain superoxide dismutase and the acetylcholine esterase activity.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2018.05.003","",NA,NA

An avoidance assay system was used with a contamination gradient formed by seven compartments, through which the fish could move and choose the preferred compartment(s). Additionally, the influence of fish movements in promoting the mixing between compartments and thus disruption of the gradient over time was also examined by testing sodium chloride (NaCl) at sublethal concentrations. Samples with pyrimethanil were obtained from the commercial formulation Mythos (R), which was applied to mesocosm systems. Samples of the pyrimethanil-contaminated mesocosms water were collected and a series of seven concentrations (0.2 to 1.4 mg L-1 plus a control) diluted with reference (uncontaminated) mesocosm water were added to the system to form the gradient. After 4 h exposure, fish avoidance in the three highest pyrimethanil concentrations ranged from 29 to 66\%. The 4 h-AC(50) (concentration at which 50\% of the fish avoided pyrimethanil after 4 h exposure) was 1.10 (confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.12) mg L-1. However, the avoidance pattern after 12 h was strongly reduced and it was not possible to calculate the AC(50). This is explained by the results of the NaCl experiment, which showed that the movement of fish in the system accelerates the mixing of the solutions between compartments. As pyrimethanil can trigger avoidance response in D. rerio, this fungicide, even at non-lethal concentrations, could be considered an environmental disturber. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we discovered unexpected effects of PBZ on zebrafish larvae and adult behaviors by challenging them with low dose exposure. Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 mu g/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) and 1000 mu g/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days. After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior, while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.","","10.3390/ijerph17134632","Anti-Anxiety Agents;Locomotion",NA,NA

Based on their mode of action in plants (potent inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis), we focused attention on mechanisms related to cellular, lipid, and steroid metabolism. Evidence from several studies reveals that zebrafish exposed to triazoles present with impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress, as well as dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Suchmetabolic disruptions are expected to underscore developmental delays, deformity, and aberrant locomotor activity and behaviors often observed following exposure. We begin by summarizing physiological and behavioral effects observed with triazole fungicide exposure in zebrafish. We then discuss mechanisms that may underlie adverse apical effects, focusing on mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism. Using computational approaches, we also identify novel biomarkers of triazole fungicide exposure. Extracting and analyzing data contained in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) revealed that transcriptional signatures responsive to different triazoles are related to metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, biological oxidations, and fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism among other processes. Pathway and sub-network analysis identified several transcripts that are responsive in organisms exposed to triazole fungicides, several of which include lipid-related genes. Knowledge gaps and recommendations for future investigations include; (1) targeted metabolomics for metabolites in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain; (2) additional studies conducted at environmentally relevant concentrations to characterize the potential for endocrine disruption, given that studies point to altered cholesterol (precursor for steroid hormones), as well as altered estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid hormone expression; (3) studies into the potential role for lipid peroxidation and oxidation of lipid biomolecules as a mechanism of triazole-induced toxicity, given the strong evidence for oxidative damage in zebrafish following exposure to triazole fungicides.

Becaute of their structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. Methods: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03 or 03 mu M of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization. Vehicle control consisted of 0.03\% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape. Results: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan. Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 mu M doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited significant (p < 0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate exposure significantly (p < 0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult fish, with fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. Discussion: Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that persisted into adulthood.

The ubiquitous occurrence of triadimefon in aquatic environments and potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms have resulted in global concerns. In this review, the current state of knowledge on occurrence, environmental behavior, and toxic effects are presented and used to conduct an assessment of risks posed by current concentrations of triadimefon in aquatic environments. Results The key findings from this review are that: (1) triadimefon occurred widely in surface waters, with high rates of detection; (2) abiotic degradation of triadimefon was affected by many factors. Stereoselectivity was found during biotic degradation and metabolism of triadimefon. Different enantiomers can cause various adverse effects, which complicates the assessment and requires enantiomers-specific considerations; (3) triadimefon exposure can affect organisms by causing multiple toxic effects on the thyroid, reproductive system, liver, nervous system as well as carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, and it can also act synergistically with other pesticides. Long-term, low-dose effects were considered to be the main characteristics of toxic effects of triadimefon; (4) results of the risk assessment based on probabilistic relationships represented by joint probability curves (JPCs) indicated that risk of triadimefon was classified as low risk. Conclusion Triadimefon occurred widely in surface waters, with high rates of detection, while the concentration data of triadimefon in surface water is insufficient. Researches about toxic effects and mechanisms of triadimefon on invertebrate are needed. Meanwhile, researches about toxic effects and environmental exposure of chiral monomers are also required. Due to its reproductive toxicity, triadimefon might result in adverse effects on the population level or even on the ecosystem level. Risk assessments for pesticides that cause long-term and low-dose effects on aquatic organisms such as triadimefon need to consider higher-level ecological risk.","","10.1186/s12302-022-00590-7","",NA,NA

Although fipronil is often used in or near aquatic environments, few studies have assessed the effects of this neurotoxicant on aquatic vertebrates at sensitive life stages. We explored the toxicological effects of fipronil on embryos and larvae using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) experimental model system. Embryos exposed to fipronil at nominal concentrations at or above 0.7 mu M (333 mu g/l) displayed notochord degeneration, shortening along the rostral-caudal body axis, and ineffective tail flips and uncoordinated muscle contractions along the body axis in response to touch. This phenotype closely resembles zebrafish locomotor mutants of the accordion class and is consistent with loss of reciprocal inhibitory neurotransmission by glycinergic commissural interneurons in the spinal cord. Consistent with the hypothesis that notochord degeneration may be due to abnormal mechanical stress from muscle tetany, the expression patterns of gene and protein markers specific to notochord development were unaffected by fipronil. Moreover, the degenerative effects of fipronil (1.1 mu M) were reversed by coexposure to the sodium channel blocker MS-222 (0.6mM). The notochord effects of fipronil were phenocopied by exposure to 70 mu M strychnine, a glycinergic receptor antagonist. In contrast, exposure to gabazine, a potent vertebrate GABA(A) antagonist, resulted in a hyperactive touch response but did not cause notochord degeneration. Although specifically developed to target insect GABA receptors with low vertebrate toxicity, our results suggest that fipronil impairs the development of spinal locomotor pathways in fish by inhibiting a structurally related glycine receptor subtype. This represents an unanticipated and potentially novel mechanism for fipronil toxicity in vertebrates.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfj185","",NA,NA

The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults.

Here, we determined the potential toxicity of four commonly used strobilurins (azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin) on mitochondrial function and locomotor activity of larval zebrafish at an environmentally relevant level. As the mode of action of strobilurins in fungi is binding to cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III, we evaluated exposure effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of zebrafish, by measuring oxygen consumption rates, mitochondria-related enzyme activities, and transcripts levels for genes associated with the electron transfer chain and citric acid cycle. We found that 50 nM pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin lowered basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP respiration, and maximal respiration of embryos. Dysfunction in mitochondrial bioenergetics was associated with changes in mitochondrial complex III activity and transcripts of oxidative respiration and stress-related genes. Lower activity of complex III, and reduced cytb mRNA levels were hypothesized to contribute to reduced electron supply to complex IV and V. Both coxI and atp6 were up-regulated, suggesting a compensatory response to impaired oxidative respiration. Cluster analysis indicated that strobilurin-induced oxidative stress and cytb transcript were related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. We also assessed larval behavior responses, as reduced ATP can affect activity. We observed that pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin induced hypoactive responses in zebrafish. At 50 nM, azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl exerted no effects on mitochondrial function nor locomotion of zebrafish.

At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96 h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test compound with 96-h EC50 of 256 mu g L-1 for pericardial edema, and 109 mu g L-1 for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that zebrafish larvae of 96 hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to 50, 100, and 200 mu g L-1 from 3 to 84 hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120 hpf, larvae from the 50 mu g L-1 group seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150 mu g L-1 BF for 72 h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level.

Therefore, the driving question of this study was: will organisms be more susceptible to suffer the deleterious effects caused by diazinon because of the stress resulting from the salinity changes? The estuarine shrimp Penaeus vannamei was used as the model organism and two responses were measured: osmoregulation (the physiological effect after a forced and continuous 24 h-exposure) and avoidance {[}the behavioural effect after a short (3 h) non-forced, multi-compartmented exposure].

At that salinity, the ability of shrimps to detect and avoid the highest diazinon concentrations was impaired. P. vannamei juveniles inhabit environments with a high variation in salinity, but with an optimum osmotic point close to a salinity of 20; therefore, the higher the salinity, the greater the vulnerability of shrimps to the effects of diazinon.

Larvae treated with 1R-BF were not sensitive to the alteration of light to dark, and the locomotor activities were reduced to a level similar to that observed in light, which otherwise increased rapidly and markedly. However, 1S-BF did not alter the general pattern of zebrafish response to the light or dark compared with the control.

However, the potential risk this poses to aquatic ecosystems is not clear. This study used zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to assess the enantioselective toxicity of benoxacor and its effects on biological activity and development from 2 h to 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). Results showed that benoxacor had negative effects on hatchability, malformations, and mortality. Compared to either individual enantiomer, embryos exposed to Rac-benoxacor had higher acute and developmental toxicities, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities, and nrf 2 expression levels. They also had lower superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme activity and krt 17, tbx 16, osx, cat, bcl 2, bax, and ifn expression levels. High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that Rac-benoxacor had a greater effect on gene regulation than either enantiomer. Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses demonstrated that changes in oxidoreductase activity, cellular lipid metabolic process, and catalytic activity related genes may be due to the enantioselective effects of benoxacor isomers. These results suggest that the ecotoxicology data and safety knowledge about the effects of chiral benoxacor on zebrafish should be considered in future environmental risk evaluation.

A number of research studies have investigated the effects of subacute developmental exposure to OP pesticides in zebrafish, observing detrimental effects on gross morphology, neuronal development, and behavior. Few studies, however, have utilized this model to evaluate treatments, such as oxime reactivators, anticholinergics, or anticonvulsants, following acute exposure. Preliminary work has investigated the effects of CWNA exposure. The results clearly demonstrated relative toxicity and oxime efficacy similar to that reported for the rodent model.

Significant differences were found: R-(-)-tebuconazole was about 1.4-5.9 times more toxic than S-(+)-tebuconazole; rac-myclobutanil was about 1.3-6.1 and 1.4-7.3 more toxic than (-)-myclobutanil and (+)-myclobutanil, respectively. Enantioselectivity was further investigated in terms of fungicide degradation in seven soil samples, which were selected to cover a broad range of soil properties. In aerobic or anaerobic soils, the S-(+)-tebuconazole degraded faster than R-(-)-tebuconazole, and the enantioselectivity showed a correlation with soil organic carbon content. (+)-Myclobutanil was preferentially degraded than (-)-myclobutanil in aerobic soils, whereas both enantiomers degraded at similar rates in anaerobic soils. Apparent correlations of enantioselectivity with soil pH and soil texture were observed for myclobutanil under aerobic conditions. In addition, both fungicides were configurationally stable in soils, i.e., no enantiomerization was found.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior and toxic effects of penthiopyrad in zebrafish. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was observed when exposed to penthiopyrad at two dose levels: S-(+)-penthiopyrad was preferentially accumulated. Moreover, S-(+)-penthiopyrad caused oxidative stress in zebrafish liver. The results of real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that exposure to penthiopyrad also enantioselectivity interfered with the expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, mtDNA synthesis, lipid metabolism and apoptosis-related genes.

Here, we investigate whether the exposure to three concentrations (0.15, 15, and 45 mu g/L) of IMI for 96 h alters responses in zebrafish. Oxidative stress parameters and acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) as well as the behavioral responses of locomotion were measured. IMI exposure decreased distance traveled in fish exposed to the 45 mu g/L. In the exploratory activity, time spent and transitions to the top area of the water column decreased in fish exposed to all concentrations of IMI. In addition, exposures to 45 and 15 mu g/L of IMI decreased episodes of erratic movement in the zebrafish. Exposures to IMI at a concentration of 45 mu g/L decreased the time spent in erratic movements and increased the time spent with no movement (i.e., ``freezing{''}). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was increased in the brain of zebrafish exposed for 96 h to concentrations of 0.15 and 45 mu g/L. Brain AChE activity was reduced and the levels of carbonyl protein (CP) increased in brain of zebrafish at concentrations of 15 and 45 mu g/L. Lipid peroxidation measured by TBARS and, also non-protein thiols (NPSH) did not show any variation in the brain of zebrafish exposed to IMI. Changes in the activity of cholinergic neurotransmitters in the brain tissues of zebrafish indicate IMI toxicity. Exposures of fish over 96 h to IMI at a nominal concentration of 45 mu g/L caused more extensive sublethal responses in zebrafish, but this concentration is well above those expected in the aquatic environment. Studies are warranted to evaluate the effects on behavior and biomarker responses in fish exposed over longer periods to IMI at environmentally relevant concentrations.","","10.1007/s00244-021-00865-9","Antioxidants",NA,NA

Paraquat did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in embryos and larvae, but it did accelerate time to hatch. To evaluate whether mitochondrial respiration was related to earlier hatch times, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole embryos. Maximal respiration of embryos exposed to 100 mu M paraquat for 24 h was reduced by more than 70\%, suggesting that paraquat negatively impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics in early development. Based upon this evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional responses of oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes were measured. Fish exposed to 1 mu M paraquat showed higher expression levels of superoxide dismutase 2, heat shock protein 70, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2a compared to control fish. No differences among groups were detected in larvae exposed to 10 and 100 mu M paraquat, suggesting a non-monotonic response. We also measured endpoints related to larval behavior and dopaminergic signaling as paraquat is associated with degeneration of dopamine neurons. Locomotor activity was stimulated with 100 mu M paraquat and dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor 3 mRNA levels were increased in larvae exposed to 1 mu M paraquat, interpreted to be a compensatory response at lower concentrations.

Among different behavioral activities, aquatic organisms' swimming behavior (fitness) is the essential factor for health assessment; thus, it is practiced routinely in neurotoxicological studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are excellent models for neurotoxicology studies. Based on the above information, we hypothesized that zebrafish's swimming behavior is a potential biomarker for neurotoxic effect assessment. We exposed zebrafish (length, 3-4 cm; weight, 0.2-0.3 g) to different synthetic organic chemicals (organophosphorus flame retardants (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl phosphate) and neurotoxic pesticides (cypermethrin and methomyl) for 15 days. For each test chemical, we chose two different concentrations (Treatment-I 5 mu L/L and Treatment-II 25 mu L/L) to study their eco-toxicity. The swimming strength of zebrafish was quantified using an online monitoring system. The swimming strength of zebrafish decreased under different treatments (Treatment-I (5 mu L/L) and -II (25 mu L/L)) of target chemicals. The circadian rhythm of zebrafish was predominantly not affected in this study. Higher neurotoxic effect (behavioral impairment) was observed in Treatment-II when compare to Treatment-I of organophosphorus flame retardants and pesticides groups. Responses of zebrafish under organophosphorus flame retardant (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl phosphate) treatments were identical with pesticide (cypermethrin and methomyl) treatments. Based on the results, we conclude that swimming behavior could be an ideal non-invasive biomarker to assess waterborne contaminants' neurotoxic effect.","","10.1007/s11356-021-13370-2","Pesticides;Organic Chemicals",NA,NA

The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish. The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between control and dichlorvos groups.

This herbicide is classified as organophosphorus compound, which is known to induce neurotoxic effects. Although this compound is classified as non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies, acute exposure to GBH causes neurological symptoms in humans. However, there is no consensus in relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH.

Our results show that GBH induced in zebrafish brain a decrease in cell viability, inhibited mitochondrial complex enzymatic activity, modulated gene expression related to mitochondrial complexes, induced an increase in RS production, promoted hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane, and induced behavioral impairments. Together, our data contributes to the knowledge of the neurotoxic effects of GBH. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a relevant cellular response that should not be disregarded.

However, much less is known about the effects of exposure to small quantities of the pesticides on neural systems and behavior during development. In the current study we used zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects of two of the most widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on zebrafish behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the organophosphates during different time points in development and then tested at 5 days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental and AChE abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that chlorpyrifos and malathion cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such as swim speed (hypoactivity vs. hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally, the pesticides affect only certain behaviors, such as thigmotaxis, during specific time points in development that are unrelated to changes in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not chlorpyrifos also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions compared to controls by 5 days postfertilization. We conclude that exposure to very low concentrations of organophosphate pesticides during development cause abnormalities in behavior and brain size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp (R) UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2 and 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for 72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations. Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae exposed to 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory- motor coordination during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should not be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

There was a significant increase in mortality over time and at 100 mu M, only 50\% of the animals survived 96 h compared to > 95\% for all other experimental groups. There was evidence for increased hatching time with 10 mu M tebuconazole compared to the control group (similar to 7 h longer at 50\% total hatch) or a lack of hatch observed with 100 mu M. Oxidative respiration and behavior were evaluated to assess whether the fungicide impaired energy-associated processes. Oxygen consumption rates in embryos (exposed from similar to 6 hpf) were determined with exposure to 2.5, 25, 50, 100 pM tebuconazole for 24 h using the XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Embryos treated with 100 pM showed a similar to 60\% reduction in basal respiration, indicating impaired oxygen consumption and/or changes in resource allocation (e.g. anti-oxidant production, metabolite synthesis). Environmentally-relevant concentrations of tebuconazole did not affect oxidative phosphorylation. As behavior is a sensitive endpoint for toxicity, we measured the dark photokinesis response and conducted a light-dark preference test in 6 dpf larvae following a sub-chronic exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M tebuconazole beginning with 6 hpf embryos. It was observed in two independent experiments for dark photokinesis that 10 mu M tebuconazole reduced total distance moved (i.e. hypoactivity) in the dark period by similar to 25-35\%. In the light-dark preference test, there was an increase for mean time in dark zone (similar to 100\% increase in the average time/visits per second) and frequency in dark zone (increase of similar to 35\% in average number of visits) with tebuconazole, suggestive of anxiolytic behavior at environmentally-relevant doses. This study demonstrates that exposure to tebuconazole can affect survival, hatch time, oxidative phosphorylation, and behavioral activity of early-staged zebrafish. While survival, hatch time, and mitochondrial bioenergetics were not different than control fish at environmentally-relevant levels of tebuconazole, behavioral responses were detected at concentrations reported in some aquatic environments.","","10.1016/j.cbpc.2018.11.017","Anti-Anxiety Agents;Ventilators, Mechanical;Respiration",NA,NA

Due to a continuous increase in the use of pyrethroids and their widespread application, different generations and types of pyrethroids have been frequently reported from environmental media, biota, and residential areas. Synthetic pyrethroids are observed to be less toxic to mammal and birds, relatively toxic to amphibians, and highly toxic to aquatic organisms including fish. Here, we review the occurrence, fate, biotransformation, and bioavailability of pyrethroids in waters. We also present biomarkers used to evidence toxicological effects of pyrethroids on fish. Toxic effects include oxidative stress and damage such as production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation; neurological behavioral inconsistencies; developmental effects such as delayed development and signaling; biochemical alterations of protein, glucose, and enzymes; hematological changes in white blood cells, red blood cells, and hemoglobin; physiological effects on metabolism and heart function; histopathological changes in the brain, liver, and gills; molecular toxicity including DNA damage, micronuclei induction, and altered gene or mRNA expression; and reproductive or endocrine disruption, e.g., disrupted pathways and signaling.

The results show that antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism of action.

Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1–10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1–10 μg/L).

Although several genetic risk factors have been identified in recent years, little is known about the environmental factors that either cause neurobehavioral disorders or contribute to their progression in genetically predisposed individuals. One environmental factor that has raised concerns is chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide that is widely used in agriculture and is found ubiquitously in the environment. In the present study, we examined the effects of sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure on anxiety-related behavior during development using zebrafish larvae. We found that sub-chronic exposure to 0.01 or 0.1 mu M chlorpyrifos during development induces specific behavioral defects in 7-day-old zebrafish larvae. The larvae displayed decreases in swim speed and thigmotaxis, yet no changes in avoidance behavior were seen. Exposure to 0.001 mu M chlorpyrifos did not affect swimming, thigmotaxis, or avoidance behavior and exposure to 1 mu M chlorpyrifos induced behavioral defects, but also induced defects in larval morphology. Since thigmotaxis, a preference for the edge, is an anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae, we propose that sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure interferes with the development of anxiety-related behaviors. The results of this study provide a good starting point for examination of the molecular, cellular, developmental, and neural mechanisms that are affected by environmentally relevant concentrations of organophosphate pesticides. A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms is important for the development of predictive models and refined health policies to prevent toxicant-induced neurobehavioral disorders.

Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that is used for turf protection, residential, and other commercial applications. As such, it can enter local rural and urban water systems via run-off and rain events. Early life stages of aquatic organisms can be susceptible to pesticides that enter the water, but in the case of triticonazole, data on the potential for subacute toxicity are lacking. Here, we determined the effects of triticonazole on development, oxygen consumption rates, and locomotor activity in zebrafish to address this knowledge gap. Wild-type zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to triticonazole (1-100 mu M) in early development for different lengths of time depending on the assay conducted. Triticonazole did not affect survival nor induce significant deformity (pericardial edema, skeletal defects) in zebrafish at doses up to 100 mu M. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in embryos after 24 and 48 hour exposure to triticonazole beginning at similar to 6 hpf using the XFe flux analyzer. Triticonazole did not affect basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration, FCCP-induced maximum respiration, proton leak, spare capacity, nor non-mitochondrial respiration at doses up to 100 mu M for 24 hours, even for exposure up to 250 mu M for 48 hours. To determine whether the fungicide affected larval swimming activity, the visual motor response test was conducted following triticonazole exposure for 6 days. Larval zebrafish exposed to triticonazole showed hypoactivity in the dark following a 100 mu M treatment, suggesting that the fungicide can affect the locomotor activity of zebrafish, albeit at relatively high levels. Given the fact that sublethal biological responses were absent at lower environmentally relevant concentrations, we conclude that triticonazole, relative to other triazole fungicides and types of pesticides, exhibits a relatively low risk of toxicity to the early life stages of fish.","","10.1002/tox.22862","Triazoles",NA,NA

Two freshwater species, Daphnia pulex and Danio rerio, were evaluated for swimming behavior alterations resulting from 24-hr exposure to 9 CECs: triclosan, triclocarban, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, 4-nonylphenol, bisphenol-A, atrazine, metformin, and estrone. This is the first step in the development of a bioassay for detecting estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic activity with the goal to evaluate complex mixtures of uncharacterized contaminants in water samples. The second step, described in a subsequent report, examines transcriptome alterations following chemical exposure. Significant differences in the swimming behavior response and sensitivity were found across chemicals within a species and across species for a given chemical in this unique optical bioassay system. In the concentration ranges studied, significant behavioral alterations were detected for 6 of 9 CECs for D. pulex and 4 of 9 CECs for D. rerio. These results underscore the utility of this bioassay to identify behavioral effects of sublethal concentrations of CECs before exploration of transcriptomic alterations for EDC detection.

The effects of these exposures on embryonic morphology, larval behavior and antioxidant gene expression were analyzed.

Co-exposure of ESF with a-TOC (1-3 mM) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ESF-induced embryonic malformations. Exposure to solely alpha-TOC did not affect rates of survival or malformations. Behavior studies showed that ESF caused hyperactivity at 5 days post fertilization, indicating a developmental neurotoxic effect. The ESF-induced hyperactivity was ameliorated by alpha-TOC. Elevated ESF concentrations caused down-regulation of the antioxidant genes cuzn-sod, gpxl a and cat, suggesting that ESF promoted oxidative stress in the embryos. alpha-TOC did not prevent the ESF-induced dysregulation of these genes.

This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements, heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 mu g/L) and the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of 21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in larvae exposed to more than 100 mu g/L of individual substances (craniofacial deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 mu g/L of each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found. Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53 gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each substance; MESA 30 mu g/L; and MOA 100 mu g/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) and MESA metabolite (1 mu g/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the thyroid system disruption represents a likely hypothesis behind the effects caused by the low environmental concentrations of S-metolachlor, its two metabolites and their mixture.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105444","Thyroid Gland",NA,NA

However, the propensity of diquat to propagate reactive oxygen species ensures that diquat remains an exposure risk in non-target organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to diquat (1, 10, 100 mu M) beginning at similar to 6 h post fertilization for up to 7 days to learn more about the mechanisms underlying diquat toxicity during vertebrate development. Zebrafish embryos exposed to diquat for 96 h did not show any significant mortality nor deformity compared to controls. Moreover, there was no difference in the timing of hatch, an indicator of stress, for fish exposed to diquat. To determine whether changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics occurred in early development as a response to diquat exposure, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole embryos. Basal respiration and ATP production were decreased following a 24 h diquat exposure at 100 mu M, suggesting that diquat negatively affects oxidative phosphorylation. We also assessed locomotor behavior as a sensitive endpoint for impaired activity and neurotoxicity. Seven day old (7 dpf) zebrafish treated with diquat at the highest doses tested (10-100 mu M) showed an increase (hyper-activity) in total distance travelled, velocity, movement cumulative duration, and overall activity compared to unexposed fish. Lastly, in 7d fish, we measured transcripts related to redox balance and apoptosis as diquat has been reported to induce oxidative stress and can affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. Larvae exposed to 10 mu M diquat showed higher transcript levels of catalase compared to control fish, implying that reactive oxygen species are produced following diquat exposure. Transcript levels of sod1, sod2, bcl2, bax and caspase 3 however did not vary in abundance among treatments with diquat. This study improves mechanistic understanding of diquat in fish at early stages of development and presents evidence that diquat disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics and behavior.","","10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.10.022","Motor Activity;Energy Metabolism",NA,NA

In a laboratory study, we investigated direct and post-exposure effects of endosulfan on Bufo bufo tadpoles. For this purpose we exposed the tadpoles to a single short-term contamination event (96 h) at an environmentally-realistic concentration (200 mu g endosulfan/L). This was followed by a recovery period of 10 days when the experimental animals were kept in pesticide-free water. The endpoints were assessed in terms of mortality, incidence of deformity, effects on behavior, and the morpho-functional features of the epidermis. We found that a short-term exposure to the tested concentration of endosulfan did not cause mortality but induced severe sublethal effects, such as hyperactivity, convulsions, and axis malformations. Following relocation to a pesticide-free environment, we noted two types of response within the experimental sample, in terms of morphological and behavioral traits. Moreover, by using both ultrastructural and a morpho-functional approach, we found that a short-term exposure to endosulfan negatively affected the amphibian epidermis. We also observed several histo-pathological alterations: increased mucous secretion, an increase in intercellular spaces and extensive cell degeneration, together with the induction of an inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Following the post-exposure period, we found large areas of epidermis in which degeneration phenomena were moderate or absent, as well as a further increase in iNOS immunoreactivity. Thus, after 10 days in a free-pesticide environment, the larval epidermis was able to partially replace elements that had been compromised due to a physiological and/or a pathological response to the pesticide. These results highlight the need for both exposure and post-exposure experiments, when attempting to assess pollutant effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Fipronil impairs the regular inhibition of nerve impulses that ultimately result in paralysis and death of insects. Because of its use as a pest control, and due to runoff events, fipronil has been detected in freshwater systems near agricultural areas, and therefore might represent a threat to non-target aquatic organisms. In this study, the toxicity of fipronil to the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius was investigated at biochemical, molecular, and whole organism (e.g. growth, emergence, and behavior) levels. At the individual level, chronic (28 days) exposure to fipronil resulted in reduced larval growth and emergence with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.081 mu g L-1. Adult weight, which is directly linked to the flying performance and fecundity of midges, was also affected (LOEC = 0.040 mu g L-1). Additionally, behavioral changes such as irregular burrowing behavior of C. riparius larvae (EC50 = 0.084 mu g L-1) and impairment of adult flying performance were observed. At a biochemical level, acute (48 h) exposure to fipronil increased cellular oxygen consumption (as indicated by the increase of electron transport system (ETS) activity) and decreased antioxidant and detoxification defenses (as suggested by the decrease in catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities). Exposure to fipronil also caused alterations in the fatty acid profile of C. riparius, since high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA) were observed. A comparison between exposed and non-exposed larvae also revealed alterations in the expression of globins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and proteins involved in protein biosynthesis. These alterations may aid in the interpretation of potential mechanisms of action that lead to the effects observed at the organism level. Present results show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil are toxic to chironomid populations which call for monitoring of phenylpyrazole insecticides and of their ecological effects in freshwaters. Present results also emphasize the importance of complementing ecotoxicological data with molecular approaches such as proteomics, for a better interpretation of the mode of action of insecticides in aquatic invertebrates.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.105292","",NA,NA

For all cases, the method allowed distinguishing between the control and treated groups within two cycles of light: dark. The calculated parameter was statistically significantly different between the treated and control groups, except for the lowest CdCl2 concentration (0.625 mg/L) in one replicate. This proof of-concept study shows the potential of the proposed methodology for utilization as part of a multi species biomonitoring system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, which is likely to affect behaviour of the organism. NiCl(2) targets the active sites of enzymes and is regarded as an unspecific toxicant for aquatic organisms. Several endpoints, such as locomotor activity, morphological abnormalities, and mortality of D. rerio embryos and larvae were studied. During acute exposures to >= 0.25 mg/L of chlorpyrifos, locomotor activity tended to increase. However, this activity decreased significantly at >= 7.5 mg Ni/L. Subchronic exposures to CHP resulted in behavioural changes at much lower concentrations (>= 0.01 mg/L) and considerably earlier than the observed increase in morphological abnormalities and mortality (LC(50) (10 d): 0.43 mg/L). Combined CHP and NiCl(2) Mixtures led to an antagonistic deviation from the concept of independent action, in the case of locomotor activity.

Zebrafish embryos at 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either a solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mu M cyproconazole for 96 h. Data indicated that cyproconazole exhibited low toxicity to zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC50 value of 90.6 mu M ( 26.4 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos/larvae displayed a significant decrease in spontaneous movement, hatching rate, and heartbeats/20 s with 50, 100, and 250 mu M cyproconazole exposure. Malformations (i.e., pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail deformation, and spine deformation) were also detected in zebrafish exposed to ae<yen> 50 mu M cyproconazole, with significant increases in cumulative deformity rate at 48, 72, and 96 hpf. In addition, a 20-30\% decrease in basal and oligomycin-induced ATP respiration was observed after 24-h exposure to 500 mu M cyproconazole in embryos. To determine if cyproconazole affected locomotor activity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae following 7-day exposure to 1, 10, and 25 mu M cyproconazole in two independent trials. Activity in the dark period was decreased for zebrafish exposed to 25 mu M cyproconazole in the first trial, and hypoactivity was also observed in zebrafish exposed to 1 mu M cyproconazole in a second trial, suggesting that cyproconazole can affect locomotor activity. These data improve understanding of the toxicity of cyproconazole in developing zebrafish and contribute to environmental risk assessments for the triazole fungicides on aquatic organisms. We report that, based on the overall endpoints assessed, cyproconazole exhibits low risk for developing fish embryos, as many effects were observed above environmentally-relevant levels.","","10.1007/s11356-018-3957-z","Triazoles",NA,NA

A battery of behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages.

One group of 14-month-old adult ZF were exposed acutely as adults (0.4, 1.25, and 4.0 mu M) for five days and tested as adults, and another group was exposed developmentally 5-120 h post-fertilization (70, 210, and 700 nM) and tested at larval, adolescent, adult, and aging life stages. ZF exposed acutely as adults did not display many significant neurobehavioral impacts or mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the embryonically exposed ZF showed altered behavioral functions at each stage of life which emerged and attenuated as fish transitioned from each developmental stage to the next. Mitochondrial oxygen consumptions measurement results for developmentally DZN exposed ZF showed significant increases in the low and middle dose groups in organs such as the brain and testes. Overall, there is an indication that early developmental exposure to DZN had continuing adverse neurobehavioral and cellular consequences throughout their lives well into adulthood and aging periods.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2021.107011","Organophosphates",NA,NA

These effects at the encephalic level appear to derive from the interference of major signaling factors such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor subtypes (H1-4R). HA is one of the main biogenic amine neuronal system responsible for regulatory homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms and motor activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how they are capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor subtypes. Interestingly, subtype 2 (H2R) proved to be a preferential target of heavy metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as displayed by its specific antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et al., 2003, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the preferential H3R antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfer with normal swimming behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 227:248-256). In the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan, their actions tend to mostly account for feeding alterations through hypothalamic H3R-dependent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to highlight the type of ED-HAergic neuroreceptor variations that are involved in stressor-dependent neurobehavioral responses of commercially valuable marine teleosts.","","10.3109/10408444.2010.487479","Military Personnel",NA,NA

Exposure studies were performed where zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin at 0.1, 10, 100 mu g/L from 4 hpf to 48 hpf to measure mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress mRNA transcripts, and 5 dpf to measure movement, growth, oxygen consumption, enzymatic activities, and mRNA transcripts. Results from this study indicated that there was a significant reduction in both basal and maximal respiration at 48 hpf in zebrafish exposed to 100 mu g/L of pyraclostrobin. There was no difference in oxidative stress or apoptotic mRNA transcripts at 48 hpf, indicating that the two strobilurins were acting first on mitochondrial function and not directly through oxidative stress. At 5 dpf, standard body length was significantly reduced with exposure to pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin exposure as compared to the control. These reductions in apical endpoints corresponded with increases in oxidative stress and apoptotic mRNA transcripts in treatment groups at 5 dpf indicating that strobilurins' exposure followed the adverse outcome pathway for mito-toxicants.

Behavior strength of Danio rerio was approximately 0.83 in the control group and was slightly higher than 0.83 in the sublethal treatment (0.1 TU (toxic unit)), which suggested that sublethal DM exposure could induce a stimulation effect in 48 h of exposure. In lower DM concentration treatments (0.5 and 1.0 TU), behavior strength could be inhibited significantly. Behavior responses of Danio rerio showed a gradually increased tendency when they were exposed to higher concentration of DM, and the declining amplitudes of behavior strength changed with the increase of DM concentrations. These results suggested that DM had evident acute toxicity effects on the behavior responses of Danio rerio with a good dose-effect relationship. The in situ remediation of the DM pollution using sodium percarbonate showed that the toxic effect of DM on behavior responses of Danio rerio could be eliminated even in the highest concentration of DM (5.0 TU).

Compared with other studies, in the present paper we investigated the acute effects of two heavy metals associated with a pesticide on zebrafish, in the range of environmentally relevant concentrations. Thus, the environmental concentrations of cadmium and nickel in three rivers affected by urban activities and one river with protected areas as background control were measured. The observations that resulted in our study demonstrated that del tamethrin toxicity was significantly decreased in some of the behavioral variables and oxidative stress when combined with Cd-Ni mixture. Consequently, our study supports previous works concerning the combined toxicity of environmental chemicals since their simultaneous presence in the aqueous environment may lead to higher or lower toxicological effects on biota than those reported from a single pollutant. Therefore, the evaluation of toxic effects of a single contaminant does not offer a realistic estimate of its impact against aqueous ecosystems This study also supports the idea that the interactions between different chemical compounds which do not exceed the maximum permitted limits in environment may have benefits for aquatic life forms or be more toxic.

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.","","10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012","",NA,NA

The present study examined the effects of chronic (28 days) aqueous exposure of chiral penflufen (rac-penflufen, R-(-)-penflufen and S-(+)-penflufen), a widely used fungicide, with/without cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic heavy metal in zebrafish (Danio rerio). After rac-penflufen individual or combined exposure with Cd, the bioaccumulation and residual levels of S-(+)-penflufen were significantly higher than R-(-)-penflufen, and the effects of Cd were insignificantly. But for penflufen enantiomer, the effects of Cd were more serious for R- (-)-penflufen, which could increase the bioaccumulation (up to1.73 times), inhibit the dissipation (up to 32.3\%) and enhance the residue (up to 5.35 times) of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, decreasing the enantioselectivity. However, significant increase of S-(+)-penflufen concentrations was only found in viscera under co-exposure of Cd. The tissue distribution of penflufen enantiomers were not affected by the presence of Cd, and no intercon-version of the two enantiomers occurred regardless of the presence of Cd. These findings indicated that co-contamination with Cd could increase the persistence of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, thus increasing the environmental risks. The significant differences of Cd effects on chiral pesticide enantiomer and racemate indicated that the combined pollution of heavy metal and chiral pesticide might have enantiomer-specific, which should raise concern, and the enantioselective mechanism deserve further study.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113270","",NA,NA

Zebrafish were fed pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8 mu g/g dieldrin for 21 days. Behavioral analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin, consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative diseases. Biological significance: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration. These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework for pesticide induced neurotoxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, zebrafish larvae were exposed, from 1.5 to 120 h post-fertilization, to a broad concentration range (0.05 -10.000 mu g/L) of glyphosate to explore its impact on the brain. We evaluated morphology, tracked locomotor behavior and neurophysiological parameters, examined neuro-glio-vascular cell structures, and outlined transcriptomic outcomes by RNA sequencing. At the concentration range tested, glyphosate did not elicit gross morphological changes. Behavioral analysis revealed a significant decrease in locomotor activity following the exposure to 1000 mu g/L glyphosate or higher. In parallel, midbrain electrophysiological recordings indicated abnormal, and variable, spike activity in zebrafish larvae exposed to 1000 mu g/L glyphosate. Next, we asked whether the observed neurophysiological outcome could be secondary to brain structural modifications. We used transgenic zebrafish and in vivo 2-photon microscopy to examine, at the cellular level, the effects of the behavior-modifying concentration of 1000 mu g/L, comparing to low 0.1 mu g/L, and control. We ruled out the presence of cerebrovascular and neuronal malformations. However, microglia morphological modifications were visible at the two glyphosate concentrations, specifically the presence of amoeboid cells suggestive of activation. Lastly, RNAseq analysis showed the deregulation of transcript families implicated in neuronal physiology, synaptic transmission, and inflammation, as evaluated at the two selected glyphosate concentrations. In zebrafish larvae, behavioral and neurophysiological defects occur after the exposure to high glyphosate concentrations while cellular and transcript signatures can be detected in response to low dose. The prospective applicability to ecotoxicology and the possible extension to brain-health vulnerability are critically discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson’s disease (PD)‐related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochon-dria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(ag-onists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 μg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5 mg/mL, anti‐parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti‐social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups—(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA—displayed an impaired, often anti-thetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT‐treated zebrafish (e—h).

Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35\%, and reduced overall activity by 72\%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a side effect, however, these insecticides contaminate bodies of water, resulting in damage to aquatic organisms. The development of nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the control of agricultural pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing their toxicological effects. Based upon this, the present study has investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate chitosan nanoparticles (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on non-target organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM, as well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity was also evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT (NP + DMT), and commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and larvae of Danio rerio (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology, and behavior. The nanoparticle control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size values of 283 +/- 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 +/- 0.05 and a zeta potential of -31 +/- 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate, the nanoparticles showed 301 +/- 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 +/- 0.02, a zeta potential of -27.9 +/- 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 +/- 0.32\%, with slow-release overtime (52\% after 48 h). The AFM images showed that both types of nanoparticles showed spherical morphology. Major toxic effects on embryo larval development were observed in commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the technical pesticide, predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With regard to the toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an increase for LC50-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior of the larvae was not affected. The data obtained demonstrate that nanoencapsulated dimethoate reduces the toxicity of insecticides on zebrafish larvae, suggesting that nanoencapsulation may be safer for non-target species, by eliminating collateral effects and thus promoting sustainable agriculture.","","10.1016/j.impact.2022.100408","Insecticides;Nanoparticles",NA,NA

Using zebrafish as the model, we investigated how different classes of insecticides influence fish behavior and uncovered neuronal underpinnings of the associated behavioral changes, providing an unprecedented insight into the perception of these chemicals by fish. We observed that zebrafish larvae avoid diazinon and imidacloprid while showing no response to other insecticides with the same mode of action. Moreover, ablation of olfaction abolished the aversive responses, indicating that fish smelled the insecticides. Assessment of neuronal activity in 289 brain regions showed that hypothalamic areas involved in stress response were among the regions with the largest changes, indicating that the observed behavioral response resembles reactions to stimuli that threaten homeostasis, such as changes in water chemistry.

Corresponding regulatory hazard assessments are costly, time consuming and require large numbers of non-human animal studies. Currently, predictive toxicology of development compounds relies on their chemical structure and provides little insights into toxicity mechanisms that precede adverse effects. Using the zebrafish embryo model, we characterized transcriptomic responses to a range of sublethal concentrations of six nerve-and muscle-targeting insecticides with different MoA (abamectin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, imidacloprid \& methoxychlor). Our aim was to identify affected biological processes and suitable biomarker candidates for MoA-specific signatures. Abamectin showed the most divergent signature among the tested insecticides, linked to lipid metabolic processes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after imidacloprid exposure were primarily associated with immune system and inflammation. In total, 222 early responsive genes to either MoA were identified, many related to three major processes: (1) cardiac muscle cell development and functioning (tcap, desma, bag3, hspb1, hspb8, flnca, myoz3a, mybpc2b, actc2, tnnt2c), (2) oxygen transport and hypoxic stress (alas2, hbbe1.1, hbbe1.3, hbbe2, hbae3, igfbp1a, hif1al) and (3) neuronal development and plasticity (npas4a, egr1, btg2, ier2a, vgf). The thyroidal function related gene dio3b was upregulated by chlorpyrifos and downregulated by higher abamectin concentrations. Important regulatory genes for cardiac muscle (tcap) and forebrain development (npas4a) were the most frequently ifferentially expressed across all insecticide treatments. We consider the identified gene sets as useful early warning biomarker candidates, i.e. for developmental toxicity targeting heart and brain in aquatic vertebrates. Our findings provide a better understanding about early molecular events in response to the analyzed MoA.

Therefore, using pesticides is the only way to reach a sufficient number of crops for the human population. However, using these agrochemicals has one big disadvantage-harmful effects on non-target species. Since aquatic ecosystems are essential for biota, fauna, flora, and humans, this study provides information about the toxicity of primary metabolites of commonly used glyphosate and acetochlor herbicides. Generally, it is known that pesticide degradation products may have lower, the same, or even higher toxicity than their parental compounds. Moreover, the developmental stages are more predisposed to be affected by pollution than adults, and consequently, in the worst case, it may affect the whole species population. Due to this reason, we studied the toxicity of these metabolites on embryolarval marbled crayfish-how they can affect their growth, ontogenetic development, behaviour, and gill morphology. Our study revealed that these two metabolites alone induce changes in behaviour, antioxidant enzymes, and gill morphology, even in combination. Nevertheless, there is a gap in the knowledge about pesticides' metabolite toxicities, a small fraction of the hundreds with potential for entering the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, chronic toxicity tests are suitable for evaluating the toxicity of aquatic pollution. Degradation products of herbicides, alone and in combination, may affect non-target aquatic organisms via leaching or runoff from the soil. The effects of 50-day exposure of primary metabolites of chloroacetamide herbicide, acetochlor ESA (AE; 4 mu g/L), and glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; 4 mu g/L), and their combination (AMPA + AE; 4 + 4 mu g/L) on mortality, growth, oxidative stress, antioxidant response, behaviour, and gill histology of early life stages of marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) were investigated. While no treatment effects were observed on cumulative mortality or early ontogeny, growth was significantly lower in all exposed groups compared with the control group. Significant superoxide dismutase activity was observed in exposure groups, and significantly higher glutathione S-transferase activity only in the AMPA + AE group. The gill epithelium in AMPA + AE-exposed crayfish showed swelling as well as numerous unidentified fragments in interlamellar space. Velocity and distance moved in crayfish exposed to metabolites did not differ from controls, but increased activity was observed in the AMPA and AE groups.

Although vertebrates are less sensitive to neonicotinoid insecticides than invertebrates, some neonicotinoids have been shown to cause neurobehavioral changes in larval fishes. In the present study, we examine the neurobehavioral toxicity of acute and chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam in fathead minnows at two different life stages. Whereas acute exposure of embryos to thiamethoxam does not appear to stimulate spontaneous contractions within 1 min, chronic exposure of embryos to 1.57 mu g or more thiamethoxam/L caused increased mortality as well as a subtle increase in spontaneous contraction frequency (SCF), which was negatively correlated with early hatching success. Chronic exposure of embryos to 155 mu g thiamethoxam/L impaired predator escape response, and chronic exposure to 0.02-14.61 mu g thiamethoxam/L impaired foraging efficiency of some fish. Fathead minnows exposed to thiamethoxam beginning post hatch did not experience changes to measured health or neurobehavioral indicators. Taken together, our findings indicate that embryonic life stages are more sensitive to thiamethoxam exposure than later larval life stages. Because early exposure to thiamethoxam can cause deficits in predatory escape behaviors and may impair foraging success, further study of the potential direct and nondirect impacts of thiamethoxam on wild fish populations is warranted.

In this study, we show that the heartbeat and hatchability of zebrafish were significantly influenced by IMZ concentrations of 300 mu g L-1 or higher. Moreover, in zebrafish larvae, locomotor behaviors such as average swimming speed and swimming distance were significantly decreased after exposure to 300 mu g L-1 IMZ for 96 h, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression and activity were consistently inhibited in IMZ-treated fish. Our results further suggest that IMZ could act as a neuroendocrine disruptor by decreasing the expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as Glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), Myelin basic protein (Mbp) and Sonic hedgehog a (Shha) during early developmental stages of zebrafish. In conclusion, we show that exposure to IMZ has the potential to induce developmental toxicity and locomotor behavior abnormalities during zebrafish development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As every organ within the body, the brain is also extremely susceptible to a plethora of noxious agents that change its chemistry. One component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. Results. There were no statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social interaction and locomotor tests (p>0.05). However, several exceptions have been noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p<0.05). We further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone+probiotics (p>0.05), relevant changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p<0.05 and p<0.005, respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p<0.05) have been observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the other three groups. Conclusions. Our results suggest that rotenone can be successfully used to trigger Parkinson's disease-related symptomatology in zebrafish.</p>","","10.1155/2021/9629102","Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease;Motor Activity",NA,NA

Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.015","",NA,NA

The concentration of atrazine in aqueous solution was measured as a time series. Results show that without suspended sediments, the 96-h LC50 of atrazine to Brachydanio rerio is 29.06 mg/l at 95 \% confidence interval (24.41 to 40.70 mg/l). For suspended sediments of 7500 and 15,000 mg/l, the LC50 (i.e., concentration resulting in 50 \% mortality) equates to 30.74 and 39.51 mg/l, respectively, and the corresponding confidence intervals are between 27.17 and 40.91 mg/l and between 30.43 and 126.93 mg/l in that order.

The uptake quantity and uptake rate of atrazine by B. rerio according to atrazine concentrations in the aqueous solution were computed. The research indicates that suspended sediments can decrease the absorbed rate of atrazine by B. rerio.

Whereas the etiology and pathogenesis of PD is still poorly understood, studies in animal models are providing important insights. One valuable type of animal model for PD is established by treating animals with PD-inducing neurotoxins, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat. These neurotoxins are thought to inhibit mitochondrial complex I activity leading to oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, proteasomal dysfunction, and, eventually, dopamine neuronal loss. However, the genes and pathways that underlie the neurotoxicity of these agents are not known. In this study, we explored the effect of MPTP, rotenone, and paraquat in both adult and larval zebrafish, which are highly amenable to genetic analysis that can lead to the identification of the underlying genes and pathways. Here, we report that adult zebrafish display behavioral alterations, including decreased locomotor activity in response to MPTP, whereas larval zebrafish exhibited developmental, behavioral, and DA sensitivity to these agents.

Basal oxygen consumption rates of zebrafish at 24 hpf were decreased with 1000 nM, suggesting that ziram affects oxidative phosphorylation. We also measured the expression of transcripts associated with the oxidative stress response (sod] and sod2) and dopamine receptor signaling at similar to 96 h of exposure. There was no difference in the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, nor those related to the dopamine system.

However, the impact to swimming behavior from exposure to mixtures of neurotoxicants has received little attention. In the current study, we analyzed spontaneous swimming rates of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate in vivo mixture interactions involving two chemical classes. Zebrafish were exposed to the neurotoxicants copper chloride (CuCl, 0.1 mu M, 0.25 mu M, 0.6 mu M, or 63, 16,40 ppb), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 0.1 mu M, 025 mu M, 0.6 mu M, or 35, 88, 220 ppb) and binary mixtures for 24 h to better understand the effects of Cu on CPF neurotoxicity. Exposure to CPF increased the number of animals undergoing freeze responses (an anti-predator behavior) and, at the highest CPF dose (0.6 mu M), elicited a decrease in zebrafish swimming rates. Interestingly, the addition of Cu caused a reduction in the number of zebrafish in the CPF exposure groups undergoing freeze responses. There was no evidence of additive or synergistic toxicity between Cu and CPF. Although muscle AChE activity was significantly reduced by CPF, there was a relatively poor relationship among muscle AChE concentrations and swimming behavior, suggesting non-muscle AChE mechanisms in the loss of swimming behavior. In summary, we have observed a modulating effect of Cu on CPF swimming impairment that appears to involve both AChE and non-AChE mechanisms. Our study supports the utility of zebrafish in understanding chemical mixture interactions and neurobehavioral injury. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems. Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including autism related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L) concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant concentrations of this compound (ng/L to mu g/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 mu g/L) for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety. The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally, the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.","","10.1016/j.envint.2020.106253","Oxidative Stress;Anxiety",NA,NA

Variations in environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were exposed to ATZ for 14 days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2\% acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000 mu g/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same tank was recorded for 6 min and biological samples were prepared. Our results showed that 1000 mu g/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus, but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain. Exposure to 10 mu g/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fish are an integral part of the aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress. Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term exposure to low concentrations.

Our results showed that FEN decreased the survival rate of zebrafish, with increased malformation rates and abnormal behaviors. Furthermore, we found typical parkinson-like symptoms in FEN-exposed zebrafish with increases in parkinson's disease (PD), ubiquitin, and Lewy bodies-relevant genes. We also observed the loss of dopaminergic neurons in both FEN-exposed zebrafish and PC12 cells, which were all associated with PD-like symptoms. Besides, FEN activated autophagy by the enhanced expressions of p-mTOR, and LC3-II but the reduction of p62. Further, FEN initially activated p-p38 MAPK followed by p-mTOR, which triggered the transcription of genes responsible for autophagy process and prompted the Lewy bodies neuron generation leading to the PD-like symptoms. This process was inhibited by both 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK selective inhibitor) in zebrafish and PC12 cells. These results suggest that FEN might cause parkinson-like symptom during zebrafish development through induction of autophagy and activation of p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling pathway. The study revealed the potential mechanism of FEN-induced neurotoxicity and should give new insights into a significant environmental risk factor of developing parkinson's disease.

Water and sediments from different natural waters including river HR and lake HL were applied to build up water-sediment microcosms in the laboratory. When FEN was introduced into the aqueous phase, it would partition from water to sediment gradually and be decomposed in sediment compartment.

Many hazardous pollutants may accumulate in sediments and pose a risk to the aquatic community. The present study provides an attempt to integrate a diagnostic whole mixture assessment workflow based on a slightly modified Danio rerio embryo acute toxicity test with chemical characterization. Danio rerio embryos were directly exposed to sieved sediment (63m) for 96h. Sediment samples were collected from three polluted sites (Kramfors, Sundsvall and ornskoldsvik) in the Gulf of Bothnia (Sweden) which are characterized by a long history of pulp and paper industry impact. Effect data were supported by chemical analyses of 237 organic pollutants and 30 trace elements.ResultsThe results show that malformations and neurotoxic compounds are the main drivers of differentiation in chemical and effects analyses, respectively. Specific spinal cord malformations and delayed hatching were observed only in sediments from Kramfors while light hyperactivity was seen only after exposure to sediments from Sundsvall.ConclusionsOur experiments demonstrate that specific chemical profiles lead to specific effect patterns in Danio rerio embryos. In fact, behavioral endpoints could help detect the exposure to neurotoxins, and the observation of body malformations seems to be a potential tool for the identification of site-specific pollutants as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and several pesticides. Overall, results show the suitability of Danio rerio embryos for the fast screening of sediment samples.","","10.1186/s12302-019-0188-y","Sweden;Endpoint Determination",NA,NA

Given the widespread occurrence of olfactory toxicants, there is a pressing need to understand the effects of these harmful compounds on olfactory function. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for studying human physiology, disease, and toxicity. Additionally, the anatomical components of the zebrafish olfactory system are similar to those of other vertebrates, and they present a remarkable degree of regeneration and neuroplasticity, making it an ideal model for the study of regeneration, reorganization and repair mechanisms following olfactory toxicant exposure. In this review, we focus on (1) the anatomical, morphological, and functional organization of the olfactory system of zebrafish; (2) the adverse effects of olfactory toxicants and injury to the olfactory organ; and (3) remodeling and repair neuroplasticity mechanisms following injury and degeneration by olfactory toxicant exposure.","","10.3390/ijms20071639","Neuronal Plasticity",NA,NA

Exposure to paraquat triggers oxidative damage in dopaminergic neurons and subsequently causes a behavioral defect in vivo. Thereby, persistent exposure to paraquat is known to increase Parkinson's disease risk by dysregulating dopaminergic systems in humans. Therefore, most studies have focused on the dopaminergic systems to elucidate the neurotoxicological mechanism of paraquat poisoning, and more comprehensive neurochemistry including histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems has remained unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the toxicological potential of paraquat poisoning using a variety of approaches such as toxicokinetic profiles, behavioral effects, neural activity, and broad-spectrum neurochemistry in zebrafish larvae after short-term exposure to paraquat and we performed the molecular modeling approach. Our results showed that paraquat was slowly absorbed in the brain of zebrafish after oral administration of paraquat. In addition, paraquat toxicity resulted in behavioral impairments, namely, reduced motor activity and led to abnormal neural activities in zebrafish larvae. This locomotor deficit came with a dysregulation of dopamine synthesis induced by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, which was also indirectly confirmed by molecular modeling studies. Furthermore, short-term exposure to paraquat also caused simultaneous dysregulation of other neurochemistry including cholinergic and serotonergic systems in zebrafish larvae. The present study suggests that this neurotoxicological profiling could be a useful tool for understanding the brain neurochemistry of neurotoxic agents that might be a potential risk to human and environmental health.","","10.1007/s11064-022-03615-y","",NA,NA

The mortality rate, hatch-ability rate, average heart beat of the zebrafish embryo were separately calculated. Our results suggested that exposure to isoprocarb induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. HE staining showed that exposure to isoprocarb caused developmental defect in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos. As expected, the behavioral analysis also showed that the motor ability of zebrafish embryos were significantly inhibited following exposure to isoprocarb. In terms of mechanism, The expressions of genes involved in neurodevelopment signaling path-ways, such as foxo3a, gfap, syn2a, elavl3 and sox19b, were inhibited in zebrafish embryos after exposure to isoprocarb. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also reduced in isoprocarb-treated zebrafish embryos. Moreover, oxidative stress was induced by increasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme (SOD) after exposure to isoprocarb. Expectedly, acridine orange (AO) staining and the detection of some apoptosis-related genes revealed that oxidative stress resulted in apoptosis. In short, the expressions of genes associated with the neurodevelopmental signaling pathway are inhibited, and oxidative stress is also induced in zebrafish embryos after exposure to isoprocarb, which may be the molecular basics of isoprocarb-induced neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113870","Apoptosis;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA

Early life stage zebrafish exposed to organophosphates exhibit several phenotypes that parallel the human response to organophosphates, including behavioral deficits, paralysis, and eventual death. Here, we have developed a high-throughput zebrafish screen in a 96-well plate format to find new antidotes that counteract organophosphate-induced lethality. In a pilot screen of 1200 known drugs, we identified 16 compounds that suppress organophosphate toxicity in zebrafish. Several in vitro assays coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling enabled determination of mechanisms of action for several of the antidotes, including reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cholinergic receptor antagonism, and inhibition of bioactivation.

Damage effects to nontarget organisms have been reported, particularly in the early stages of development. Studies indicate redox unbalance as secondary PM effect. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the acute PM effects on larval zebrafish. Larvae (6 days postfertilization) were exposed to PM (25-600 mu g/L) during 24 hours, and 50\% lethal concentration was estimated. For subsequent assays, the sublethal PM concentrations of 25 and 50 mu g/L were used. PM increased anxiety-like behaviors according to the Novel Tank and Light-Dark tests. At the molecular level, PM induced increased ROS, which may be related to the increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis detected in PM-exposed organisms. In parallel, upregulation of the antioxidant system was detected after PM exposure, with increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities, and thiol levels. The increased of Nrf2 target genes and the activation of an electrophile response element-driven reporter Tg(EPRE:LUC-EGFP) suggest that the Nrf2 pathway can mediate a fast response to PM, leading to antioxidant amplification. By using high-resolution respirometry, we found that exposure to PM decreased the oxygen consumption in all respiratory stages, disrupting the oxidative phosphorylation and inhibiting the electron transfer system, leading to decrease in bioenergetics capacity. In addition, PM led to increases of residual oxygen consumption and changes in substrate control ratio. Glucose metabolism seems to be affected by PM, with increased lactate dehydrogenase and decreased citrate synthase activities. Taken together, our results demonstrated the adverse effects of acute sublethal PM concentrations during larval development in zebrafish, causing apparent mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating a potential mechanism to redox unbalance and oxidative stress, which may be linked to the detected cell death and alterations in normal behavior patterns caused by acute PM exposure.","","10.1155/2019/9149203","Oxidation-Reduction;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA Damage;Energy Metabolism",NA,NA

We have developed a series of zebrafish (Danio rerio) models that inhibit, to variable degrees, distinct aspects of RC function, and enable quantification of animal development, survival, behaviors, and organ-level treatment effects as well as effects on mitochondrial biochemistry and physiology. Here, we characterize four pharmacologic inhibitor models of mitochondrial RC dysfunction in early larval zebrafish, including rotenone (complex I inhibitor), azide (complex IV inhibitor), oligomycin (complex V inhibitor), and chloramphenicol (mitochondrial translation inhibitor that leads to multiple RC complex dysfunction). A range of concentrations and exposure times of each RC inhibitor were systematically evaluated on early larval development, animal survival, integrated behaviors (touch and startle responses), organ physiology (brain death, neurologic tone, heart rate), and fluorescence-based analyses of mitochondrial physiology in zebrafish skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic RC inhibitor effects were validated by spectrophotometric analysis of Complex I, II and IV enzyme activities, or relative quantitation of ATP levels in larvae. Outcomes were prioritized that utilize in vivo animal imaging and quantitative behavioral assessments, as may optimally inform the translational potential of pre-clinical drug screens for future clinical study in human mitochondrial disease subjects. The RC complex inhibitors each delayed early embryo development, with short-term exposures of these three agents or chloramphenicol from 5 to 7 days post fertilization also causing reduced larval survival and organ-specific defects ranging from brain death, behavioral and neurologic alterations, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in skeletal muscle (rotenone), and/or cardiac edema with visible blood pooling (oligomycin). Remarkably, we demonstrate that treating animals with probucol, a nutrient-sensing signaling network modulating drug that has been shown to yield therapeutic effects in a range of other RC disease cellular and animal models, both prevented acute rotenone-induced brain death in zebrafish larvae, and significantly rescued early embryo developmental delay from either rotenone or oligomycin exposure. Overall, these zebrafish pharmacologic RC function inhibition models offer a unique opportunity to gain novel insights into diverse developmental, survival, organ-level, and behavioral defects of varying severity, as well as their individual response to candidate therapies, in a highly tractable and cost-effective vertebrate animal model system.

Due to their widespread use as agrochemicals, they can enter aquatic environments at concentrations that can elicit adverse effects in organisms. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding the toxic effects of strobilurin fungicides on aquatic species, including algal species, Daphnia magna, and fish species, to determine risk to aquatic organisms and ecosystems. Data show that the toxicities of strobilurins vary widely across aquatic species. Strobilurins bind cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III in fungi, and as such, research in aquatic species has focused on mitochondria-related endpoints following exposures to strobilurins. In fish, studies into the activities of mitochondrial complexes and the expression of genes involved in the electron transfer chain have been conducted, converging on the theme that mitochondrial complexes and their enzymes are impaired by strobilurins. In general, the order of toxicity of strobilurins for fish species are pyraoxystrobin > pyraclostrobin approximate to trifloxystrobin > picoxystrobin > kresoxim-methyl > fluoxastrobin > azoxystrobin. In addition to mitochondrial toxicity, studies also report genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption, and each of these events can potentially impact whole organism-level processes such as development, reproduction, and behavior. Screening data from the US Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast database supports the hypothesis that these fungicides may act as endocrine disruptors, and high throughput data suggest estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid hormone receptor beta can be activated by some strobilurins. It is recommended that studies investigate the potential for endocrine disruption by strobilurins more thoroughly in aquatic species. Based on molecular, physiological, and developmental outcomes, a proposed adverse outcome pathway is presented with complex III inhibition in the electron transfer chain as a molecular initiating event. This review comprehensively addresses sub-lethal toxicity mechanisms of strobilurin fungicides, important as the detection of strobilurins in aquatic environments suggests exposure risks in wildlife.

However, in respect of the presence or absence of the chorion, a consistent experimental methodology has yet to be developed. In this study, we used a fixed exposure scheme to compare the developmental toxicities of six major OPEs in chorionated and dechorionated zebrafish embryos. Removal of the chorion increased sensitivity to OPEs: we found higher incidence of mortality and malformation in dechorionated embryos. In a behavioral assay, the locomotive activity of zebrafish larvae was consistently inhibited by OPEs except tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate regardless of chorion presence. However, at the molecular level, the expression of ZHE1 and mmp9 was affected by the presence of the chorion in zebrafish embryos exposed to tributyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), respectively. Furthermore, in zebrafish embryos exposed to TPHP, the increased expression of miR-137 and miR-141 was abolished by the presence of the chorion. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the presence of the chorion influences phenotypic morbidity, organismal behavior, and gene expression in zebrafish embryos exposed to chemicals; thus, we suggest that dechorionation is desirable for exploring the toxicity mechanisms that underlie effects of chemical exposure.","","10.1016/j.jhazmal.2020.123389","Organophosphates",NA,NA

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of more sensitive biomarkers designed to earlier biomonitoring of this compound. Here we tested the hypothesis that behavioral changes induced by sublethal MZ concentrations would occur first as compared to biochemical oxidative stress markers. Embryos at 4 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to Mancozeb at 5, 10 and 20 mu g/L. Controls were kept in embryo water only. Behavioral and biochemical parameters were evaluated at 24, 28, 72, and 168 hpf after MZ exposure. The results showed that MZ significantly altered spontaneous movement, escape responses, swimming capacity, and exploratory behavior at all exposure times.

At each sampling site, pharmaceuticals/illicit drugs category was mostly represented by their cumulative concentration, followed by categories industrial chemicals, pesticides and hormones. An exposure-activity ratio (EAR) approach based on ToxCast data highlighted steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antiepileptics/neuroleptics, industrial chemicals and hormones as compounds with the highest biological potential. Summed EAR-based prediction of toxicity showed a good correlation with the estimated toxicity of assessed sampling sites using WOBs. WOBs did not exhibit increased mortality but caused various sub-lethal biological responses that were dependant relative to the sampling site pollution intensity as well as species sensitivity. Exposure of G. fossarum and D. magna to river water-induced lower feeding rates increased GST activity and TBARS levels. Zebrafish D. rerio embryo exhibited a significant decrease in heartbeat rate, failure in pigmentation formation, as well as inhibition of ABC transporters.

Here we employed Tg(nkx2.2a:mEGFP) transgenic zebrafish which have GFP expression in the central nervous system to investigate its potential for screening neurotoxic chemicals. Five potential neurotoxins (acetaminophen, atenolol, atrazine, ethanol and lindane) and one neuroprotectant (mefenamic acid) were tested. We found that the GFP-labeled ventral axons from trunk motoneurons, which were easily observed in live fry and measured for quantification, were a highly sensitive to all of the five neurotoxins and the length of axons was significantly reduced in fry which looked normal based on DarT endpoints at low concentrations of neurotoxins. Compared to the most sensitive endpoints of DarT, ventral axon marker could improve the detection limit of these neurotoxins by about 10 fold. In contrast, there was no improvement for detection of the mefenamic acid compared to all DarT endpoints. Thus, ventral axon lengths provide a convenient and measureable marker specifically for neurotoxins.

As a sodium channel blocker, at sublethal concentrations it causes off-target effects, including disruption of calcium signaling and neuronal growth. At the whole organism level, sublethal concentrations of bifenthrin cause behavioral effects in fish species, raising concerns about the neumtoxic properties of the compound on fish populations. Here we describe the application of a high-throughput behavioral system to evaluate contaminant impacts on the sensitive early-life stages of Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered teleost species endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD), California, USA. Leveraging the natural behavior of early-larval Delta smelt, whereby they increase movement in bright light and decrease movement in the dark, we developed a test using a cycle of light and dark periods in a closed chamber to test hyper- or hypoactivity for this species. We show that early-larval Delta smelt have a significant preference to move toward light, and utilized the behavioral test to evaluate the impact of exposure to bifenthrin at concentrations found in habitats where Delta smelt reportedly spawn, ranging up to concentrations detected in tributaries to these habitats. All tested concentrations of bifenthrin (nominal 2, 10, or 100 ng/L) caused hyperactivity, over a 96 h exposure, with noted significance determined during the light period of the test. To further understand the impact of bifenthrin exposure, expression of a suite of genes relevant to neurodevelopment, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and biotransformation in exposed larvae were also measured. Following exposure to picomolar concentrations of bifenthrin, expression of genes in the mTOR signaling and neurogenesis pathways were altered alongside behavior. This study demonstrates how light and dark cycle behavioral tests can be used to assess sensitive alterations in swimming activity in Delta smelt at early developmental stages and how gene expression can complement these assays. This approach can be used to assess the impact of multiple compounds that occur within the restricted habitat of Delta smelt, thus having the potential to greatly inform conservation management strategies for this critically sensitive life stage.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105611","Seasons",NA,NA

In particular, the behavioral response of the zebrafish embryo is currently seen as a useful endpoint to diagnose neuroactive substances. Consequently, several behavioral test methods have been developed addressing various behavioral endpoints such as spontaneous tail coiling (STC), photomotor response (PMR), locomotor response (LMR) and alternating light/dark-induced locomotor response (LMR-L/D). Although these methods are distinct in their application, most of their protocols differ quite strongly in the use of experimental parameters and this is usually driven by different research questions. However, if a single mode of action is to be diagnosed, then varying experimental parameters may cause incoherent behavioral responses (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish during toxicity assessment. This could lead to inconclusiveness of behavioral test results for use within a prospective and diagnostic risk assessment framework. To investigate the influence of these parameters, we conducted a review of existing behavioral assays to address the following two questions: (1) To what extent do varying experimental parameters influence observed effects in published behavioral test methods? (2) Is the observed behavior change (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish embryos consistent with the expected mode of action of a chemical? We compiled a set of 18 substances which are anticipated to be neuroactive. We found that behavioral changes are not only affected by chemicals but also variation in the use of experimental parameters across studies seems to have a high impact on the outcome and thus comparability between studies. Four parameters, i.e., exposure concentration, exposure duration, endpoint parameter and developmental stage were the most influential parameters. Varying combinations of these parameters caused a non-reproducible outcome for the hyperactivity expected for the organophosphates; chlorpyrifos and diazinon. We highlighted that the STC test shows a higher capacity to predict the hyperactivity of organophosphates, while PMR and LMR-L/D were more suitable to predict the hypoactivity expected for anticonvulsants. We provide a list of recommendations which, when implemented, may help to exclude the risk of bias due to experimental parameters if similar goals are desired.","","10.1186/s12302-019-0270-5","",NA,NA

The potential impact of atrazine exposure was studied using various markers (behaviour; biometrical characteristics; haematological, biochemical and oxidative stress indices and histopathological changes). Most alterations were recorded at the highest concentration (3000 mu g/l) which is probably due to a combined effect of both the herbicide exposure and intensive parasite infection development during second week. This group was cancelled after three weeks due to adverse health status, which partly confirmed atrazine immunotoxicity. Chronic exposure resulted in long-term reduction in feed intake followed by a significant decrease in body weight and morphological changes in gill at 1000 mu g/l. At the same concentration, significant alterations in haematological (e.g. increase in erythrocyte, leukocyte, lymphocytes and neutrophil counts as well as decrease in monocyte counts) and biochemical (e.g. changes in enzyme activities; increase in glucose; decrease in ammonia) indices were documented, especially during first three weeks. Similar trend, but not so intensive, was observed at 300 mu g/l. Moreover, significant changes were observed in various indicators of oxidative stress. These alterations were highly variable with both increasing and decreasing trends depending on dose and analysed tissue. Significant changes, especially in white blood profile, enzyme activities and oxidative stress indices, were proven even at 0.3 mu g/l. Obtained results indicate that chronic atrazine exposure of common carp can negatively influence many indicators of health status such as behaviour, immune response, haematological and biochemical profile, oxidative stress indices and organ histopathology.

Based on a high-content screen, we previously demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish embryos to abamectin - an avermectin insecticide - from 5-25 hours post-fertilization (hpf) abolished spontaneous activity in the absence of effects on survival and gross morphology. Therefore, the objective of this study was to begin investigating the mechanism of abamectin-induced hypoactivity in zebrafish. Similar to 384-well plates, static exposure of embryos to abamectin from 5-25 hpf in glass beakers resulted in elimination of activity at low micromolar concentrations. However, abamectin did not affect neurite outgrowth from spinal motoneurons and, compared with exposure from 5-25 hpf, embryos were equally susceptible to abamectin-induced hypoactivity when exposures were initiated at 10 and 23 hpf. Moreover, immersion of abamectin-exposed embryos in clean water resulted in complete recovery of spontaneous activity relative to vehicle controls, suggesting that abamectin reversibly activated ligand-gated chloride channels and inhibited neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated embryos to vehicle or non-toxic concentrations of fipronil or endosulfan - two insecticides that antagonize the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor - from 5-23 hpf, and then exposed embryos to vehicle or abamectin from 23-25 hpf. Interestingly, activity levels within abamectin-exposed embryos pretreated with either antagonist were similar to embryos exposed to vehicle alone. Using quantitative PCR and phylogenetic analyses, we then confirmed the presence of GABA receptor alpha 1 and beta 2 subunits at 5, 10, and 23 hpf, and demonstrated that zebrafish GABA receptor subunits are homologous to mammalian GABA receptor subunits. Overall, our data collectively suggest that abamectin induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity within early zebrafish embryos, an effect that may be mediated through the GABA receptor.

Markers of reactive oxygen species production (ROS), glutathione (GSH) levels and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were measured along with genotoxicity (comet assay), cell death (Acridine Orange) and behavioral parameters (spontaneous movement, touch stimulation and swimming response), in order to determine potential mechanisms of embryotoxicity. According to results, MZ was able to induce morphological abnormalities such as body axis distortion, DNA damage, cell death, increased ROS generation and changes in behavioral endpoints during zebrafish development. All these toxic effects were inhibited by the pre-treatment with NAC indicating a key role of redox unbalance during MZ-induced embryotoxicity.

In this study, four stereoisomers of sulfoxaflor were separated using HPLC, and the absolute configurations of three stereoisomers were identified via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. First, the stability and isomerization of the four enantiomers and rac- sulfoxaflor in water and seven organic solvents were investigated. All enantiomers were extremely unstable in water with isomerization rates above 20\%. The racemate did not isomerize in any of the solutions and was stable in water (degradation rate less than 7\%). Therefore, we studied the acute toxicity, enantioselective behavior, and enzymatic activities of rac-sulfoxaflor in zebrafish. The bioaccumulation experiment demonstrated that the bioconcentration of sulfoxaflor in zebrafish was enantioselective, and the four enantiomers accumulated in zebrafish in the order (+)-2S,3S-sulfoxaflor (-)-2R,3R-sulfoxaflor > (+)-2R,3S-sulfoxaflor > (-)-2S,3R-sulfoxaflor. The effect of rac- sulfoxaflor on the enzymatic activities of zebrafish showed that superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities and malondialdehyde content were significantly enhanced as compared to those in control, whereas acetylcholinesterase was significantly reduced in the sulfoxaflor exposure treatment (p < 0.05), indicating that sulfoxaflor caused oxidative lesions and induced enzymatic activity in zebrafish. This study provides important information on the enantioselective behavior and toxic effects of sulfoxaflor, which can help assess the potential ecological risk of chiral pesticides to aquatic organisms.","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153007","",NA,NA

Because of their relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of vertebrates to neonicotinoids. Methods: Using zebrafish, we investigated the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 mu M or 60 mu M of imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4 h to 5 d post fertilization. The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidadoprid and nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and-during adolescence and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank swimming, and shoaling behavior. Results: In larvae, developmental imidadoprid exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidadoprid than the AB{*} strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming, it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling stimulus. Discussion: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2015.04.006","",NA,NA

Accordingly, experimental groups were exposed to three sublethal concentrations of pesticides for 96 h, separately, and then zebrafish were transferred to pesticide-free conditions for 10 and 20 days recovery periods. Biochemical markers were assessed including carboxylesterase (CaE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST) activities after the exposure and recovery periods. Also, the pesticide concentrations in test water were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Our results showed that AChE and CaE activities were significantly inhibited and GST was induced by both pesticides after 96 h exposure. For PBP exposure, the decreases for GST induction and CaE inhibition showed a partial recovery in pesticide-free conditions. However, the decreases in AChE activity for CBP exposure and insufficient increases in same enzyme activity for PBP exposure after 20 days in pesticide-free conditions indicated that the projected recovery period was not enough to the recovery of AChE activities and for the improvement of fish health.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.05.055","Pesticides",NA,NA

The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2',4,4',5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2',4,4',-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1\% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 mu M CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mu M BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3,1, 3,10, 20 mu M BDE-99 from 5 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance. Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3 mu M CPF and 0.1 mu M BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 mu M causing hyperactivity and 1 mu M or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test. Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We measured the percent sorption in the presence and absence of zebrafish embryos, at two exposure concentrations, as well as using two-different procedures (addition of embryos to polystyrene plates either before analyte addition, or allowing 24 h of equilibrium between analyte addition and embryo addition to the polystyrene plates). Following exposure, the plates were extracted with hexane and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Allowing 24 h of pre-incubation between the addition of analytes and embryos did not significantly impact the percent sorption. The percent sorption was higher for both PAHs and NPAHs at the lower exposure concentration, and sorption was lower in the presence of zebrafish embryos. A mass balance model was developed to predict the sorption to polystyrene plates, based on the PAH and NPAH mass distribution ratios between polystyrene and water. While PAH sorption was significantly correlated with subcooled liquid solubility, NPAH sorption did not correlate with any of the physical-chemical properties investigated. This indicates the need to better understand the sorptive behavior of hydrophobic analytes to plastics, and to better account for sorptive losses during toxicity testing in polystyrene plates.

The mixed residues of chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin in the aquatic environment may have combined effects on nontarget species. Therefore, studying the combined toxic effects and mechanisms of pesticide mixtures is of great significance to environmental risk assessment. To evaluate the risk of combined exposure, we examined the effects of both compounds, separately and together, on motor activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and neurotransmitter levels in larval zebrafish. Chlorpyrifos exposure significantly reduced functional motor capacity (swim distance and velocity) and enhanced meandering, while cyfluthrin exposure alone had no significant effects on swim parameters. However, combined exposure significantly reduced total swimming distance and mean velocity and increased meandering. Both compounds alone and the combination significantly reduced AChE activity, and the combined effect was antagonistic. Combined exposure also significantly altered the concentrations of serotonin, serotonin precursors, and dopamine precursors, as well as concentrations of the amino acid neurotransmitters glycine, alanine, and aspartic acid. Combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin exhibited distinct joint action modes in terms of neurobehavior, AChE activity, and neurotransmitter levels, thereby providing an experimental basis for assessing the combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin's environmental risk.","","10.1002/jat.4334","",NA,NA

Wide arrays of biomarkers have been employed to delineate the toxic responses which include lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) and apoptosis studies. A decrease in the GSH levels, increase in lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, respectively, were observed at various developmental stages.

We have developed a battery of measures of zebrafish behavior, which are reliable and sensitive to toxicant-induced damage. This study determined the critical duration of developmental CPF exposure for causing persisting neurobehavioral effects. Tests of sensorimotor response (tap startle response and habituation), stress response (novel tank diving test) and learning (3-chamber tank spatial discrimination) were conducted with adult zebrafish after early developmental CPF exposure. The CPF exposure level was 100 ng/ml with durations of 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 and 0-5 days after fertilization. Developmental CPF exposure had persisting behavioral effects in zebrafish tested as adults. In the tactile startle test, CPF exposed fish showed decreased habituation to startle and a trend toward increased overall startle response. In the novel tank exploration test, exposed fish showed decreased escape diving response and increased swimming activity. In the 3-chamber learning test, the 0-5 day CPF exposure group had a significantly lower learning rate. There was evidence for persisting declines in brain dopamine and norepinepherine levels after developmental CPF exposure. In all of the measures the clearest persistent effects were seen in fish exposed for the full duration of five days after fertilization. In a follow-up experiment there were some indications for persisting behavioral effects after exposure during only the later phase of this developmental window. This study demonstrated the selective long-term neurobehavioral alterations caused by exposure to CPF in zebrafish.

In the present study, we examined movement behavior of larval zebrafish over 7 days (4-10 days post fertilization or dpf) during typical daylight workday hours to determine whether intrinsic activity differed with age and time of day. We then employed an early life stage approach using the Fish Embryo Test (FET) at multiple developmental ages to evaluate whether photomotor response (PMR) behavior differed with zebrafish age following exposure to diazinon (DZN), a well-studied orthophosphate insecticide, and diphenhydramine (DPH), an antihistamine that also targets serotonin reuptake transporters and the acetylcholine receptor. 72 h studies were conducted at 1-4, 4-7 and 7-10 dpf, followed by behavioral observations using a ViewPoint system at 4, 7 and 10 dpf. Distance traveled and swimming speeds were quantified; nominal treatment levels were analytically verified by isotope-dilution LC-MSMS. Larval zebrafish locomotion displayed significantly different (p < 0.05) activity profiles over the course of typical daylight and workday hours, and these time of day PMR activity profiles were similar across ages examined (4-10 dpf). 10 dpf zebrafish larvae were consistently more sensitive to DPH than either the 4 or 7 dpf larvae with an environmentally realistic lowest observed effect concentration of 200 ng/L.

We found that pyridaben is highly toxic to aquatic organisms, and LC50 of pyridaben for zebrafish at 72 hpf was 100.6 mu g/L. Pyridaben caused severe cardiac malformations and functional abnormalities. Morphologic abnormity included severe pericardial edema, cardiomegaly, decreased cardiomyocytes, thinning of the myocardial layer, linear heart, and increased the distance between sinus venous and bulbus arteriosus (SVBA). Functional failure included arrhythmia, heart failure, and reduced pumping efficiency. The genes involved in heart development, WNT signaling, BMP signaling, ATPase, and cardiac troponin C were abnormally expressed in the pyridaben treatment group. Exposure to pyridaben increased oxidative stress and induced cell apoptosis. The above causes may lead to cardiac toxicity. The results suggest that pyridaben exposure induced elevated oxidative stress through the WNT signaling pathway, which in turn led to apoptosis in the heart and cardiotoxicity. Besides, pyridaben exposure at the critical stage of cardiac looping (24-36 hpf) resulted in the greatest cardiotoxicity. The chorion reduced the entry of pyridaben and protected zebrafish embryos, resulting in cardiotoxicity second only to the stage of cardiac looping.

However, the mechanisms underlying olfactory neurotoxicity are not well characterized, especially in environmental exposures which involve chemical mixtures. We used zebrafish to characterize olfactory transcriptional responses by two model olfactory inhibitors, the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mixtures of CPF with the neurotoxic metal copper (Cu). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from olfactory tissues of zebrafish exposed to CPF alone or to a mixture of CPF and Cu. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, whereas gene set analysis was used to identify biological themes in the microarray data. Microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR on genes serving as potential biomarkers of olfactory injury. In addition, we mined our previously published Cu-induced zebrafish olfactory transcriptional response database (Tilton et al., 2008) for the purposes of discriminating pathways of olfaction impacted by either the individual agents or the CPF-Cu mixture transcriptional signatures. CPF exposure altered the expression of gene pathways associated with cellular morphogenesis and odorant binding, but not olfactory signal transduction, a known olfactory pathway for Cu. The mixture profiles shared genes from the Cu and CPF datasets, whereas some genes were altered only by the mixtures. The transcriptional signature of the mixtures was more similar to that in zebrafish exposed to Cu alone than for CPF. In conclusion, exposure to a mixture containing a common environmental metal and pesticide causes a unique transcriptional signature that is heavily influenced by the metal, even when organophosphate predominates.

In the present study, we used a well-known dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy-dropyridine (MPTP) as a model chemical to uncover the molecular pathways for observed DNT effects. To enhance the specificity of potential molecular targets, we restricted our exposure to a concentration that is nonteratogenic yet exhibits high DNT effects and an exposure window sensitive to MPTP. Our DNT assessment based on a battery of motor and social behavioral tests revealed an effective concentration of 1 mu M and a sensitive window of 48-96 h postfertilization (hpf) for MPTP-induced hypoactivity. It is worth noting that this hypoactivity persisted into later larval development until 28 dpf. We observed increased cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and decreased ATP levels in larvae immediately after exposure at 96 hpf. Significant reductions of DA neurons were found in the retina at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. No visible deformity was found in motoneurons at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. Transcriptome analysis uncovered a novel pathway manifested by significant upregulation of genes enriched with erythropoiesis. Sensitive window exposure of MPTP and other DA neurotoxins rotenone and paraquat exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on transcriptional changes of embryonic hemoglobins and anemia. Given that anemia is a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease and MPTP is known to cause parkinsonism in humans, we concluded that anemia resulting from dysregulation of primitive erythropoiesis during embryonic development might serve as a common mechanism underlying DA neurotoxin-induced DNT effects between zebrafish and humans.","","10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00089","Anemia",NA,NA

Though the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is a common model for aquatic toxicology research and regulatory toxicology practice, this model has received little attention in behavioral studies compared to the zebrafish, a common biomedical model. We specifically compared behavioral responses among 7 different chemicals (1-heptanol, phenol, R-(-)-carvone, citalopram, diazinon, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), and xylazine) that were selected and classified based on anticipated MOA (nonpolar narcosis, polar narcosis, electrophile, specific mechanism) according to traditional approaches to examine whether these comparative responses differ among chemicals with various structure-based predicted toxicity. Following standardized experimental guidelines, zebrafish embryos and fathead minnow larvae were exposed for 96 h to each compound then were observed using digital behavioral analysis. Behavioral observations included photomotor responses, distance traveled, and stimulatory, refractory and cruising locomotor activity. Though fathead minnow larvae displayed greater behavioral sensitivity to 1-heptanol, phenol and citalopram, zebrafish were more sensitive to diazinon and R-(-)-carvone. Both fish models were equally sensitive to xylazine and PTZ. Further, the pharmaceuticals citalopram and xylazine significantly affected behavior at therapeutic hazard values, and each of the seven chemicals elicited unique behavioral response profiles. Larval fish behaviors appear useful as early tier diagnostics to identify mechanisms and pathways associated with diverse biological activities for chemicals lacking mechanistic data.

In the present study, we compared the mitochondrial and developmental toxicity of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin using zebrafish embryo/larvae. The results showed that all three strobilurins inhibited mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration (the potency is pyraclostrobin approximate to trifloxystrobin > azoxystrobin). Behavioral changes indicated that sublethal doses of pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin caused hyperactivity of zebrafish larvae in dark cycles, whereas trifloxystrobin resulted in hypoactivity of zebrafish larvae. In addition, pyraclostrobin exposure impaired the inflation of swim bladder, and caused down-regulation of annexin A5 (anxa5) mRNA levels, and up-regulated transcript levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a (pbx1a); conversely, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin did not cause detectable effects with swim bladder inflation. Molecular docking results indicated that azoxystrobin had higher interacting potency with iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD), prolactin receptor (PRLR), antagonistic conformation of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) compared to pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin; pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin were more likely to interact with the antagonistic conformation of TR beta and GR, respectively. These results may partially explain the different effects observed in behavior and swim bladder inflation, and also point to potential endocrine disruption induced by these strobilurins. Taken together, our study revealed that all three strobilurins alter mitochondrial bioenergetics and cause developmental toxicity. However, the toxic phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of each chemical may differ, and this requires further investigation. Pyraclostrobin showed higher mitochondrial toxicity at lethal doses and higher developmental toxicity at sublethal doses compared to the two other strobilurins tested. These results provide novel information for toxicological study as well as risk assessment of strobilurin fungicides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

S-metolachlor is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 mu M) over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 mu M and above. Exposure levels as high as 200 mu M for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim bladder inflation at 50 mu M in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish exposed to 50 mu M while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance, corresponding to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response test revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 mu M) resulted in hypo activity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship between surface area of the swim bladder and distance traveled, and the size of the swim bladder explained similar to 10-14\% in the variation for total distance moved. Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test, and we did not detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration tested. Here we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure to the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may disrupt transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and morphology, which could ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity. These data are expected to contribute to further risk assessment guidelines for S-metolachlor in aquatic ecosystems.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111641","Motor Activity;Agrochemicals",NA,NA

Following the determination of the 96 h-LC50, exposure to sublethal concentrations showed the safety profile of both E. arvense and M. tenuiflora. However, following 96-h exposure to Thymol, increased lethality, pericardial oedema, yolk and eye deformations, and decreased body length were observed. The reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratio was increased, and the glutathione-s-transferase activity in the group exposed to the highest Thymol concentration. Overall, these results support a more reducing environment associated with possible effects at the cellular proliferation level. In addition, the disruption of behavioural states (fear- and anxiety-like disorders) were noted, pointing to alterations in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase developmental signalling pathway, although further studies are required to explore this rationale. Notwithstanding, the results provide direct evidence of the teratogenic effects of Thymol, which might have consequences for non-target species.","","10.3390/toxics9010008","Teratogens;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA

It was observed that PM exposure delayed embryonic development, inhibited hatchability at 60 and 72 h postfertilization and increased heart rate. After PM exposure, the larval zebrafish showed abnormal free swimming behavior and the swimming behavior in response to light-dark transition, indicating that PM had the potential to induce neurotoxicity. Moreover, PM exposure also affected the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase and dopamine and the transcriptional level of genes related to neurotoxicity. In addition, PM exposure not only affects catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity but also affects the transcription level of various genes.

Treatment of this teleost with toxic cadmium levels for 1 week was sufficient to induce abnormal swimming movements, whereas reduced feeding behaviors were provoked predominantly by elevated endosulfan concentrations. In the brain, these environmental contaminants caused neuronal degeneration in cerebral targets such as the mesencephalon and hypothalamus, damage that appeared to correlate with altered binding levels of the three major histamine receptors (subtypes 1, 2, and 3). Although cadmium accounted for reduced binding activity of all three subtypes in most brain regions, it was subtype 2 that seemed to be its main target, as shown by a very great (p < 0.001) down-regulation in mesencephalic areas such as the stratum griseum central layer. Conversely, endosulfan provided very great and great (p < 0.01) up-regulating effects of subtype 3 and I levels, respectively, in preoptic-hypothalamic areas such as the medial part of the lateral tuberal nucleus, and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

After exposure, zebrafish embryos showed abnormal phenotypes such as a shortened body length, morphological malformations, and weakened heart function. Behavioral experiments indicated that antimony caused neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, manifested in a decreased spontaneous movement frequency, delayed response to touch, and reduced movement distance. We also showed that antimony caused a decrease in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in zebrafish embryos, along with decreased expression of neurofunctional markers such as gfap, nestin, mbp, and shha. Additionally, antimony significantly increased reactive oxygen species levels and significantly reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In summary, our findings indicated that antimony can induce developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos by affecting neurotransmitter systems and oxidative stress, thus altering behavior.

No significant alterations in neurotransmitter levels was observed at 7 dpf or in adult males, but a significant decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and serotonin turnover was seen in adult female brain tissue. Transcriptomic analysis was completed on adult female brain tissue to identify molecular pathways underlying the observed neurological alterations. Altered expression of 1928, 89, and 435 genes in the females exposed to 0.3, 3, or 30 mu g/L atrazine during embryogenesis were identified, respectively.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted zebrafish embryo toxicity tests to assess deformities, survival, and sub-lethal responses following exposure to zoxamide (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mu M zoxamide). We hypothesized that skeletal deformities would be prevalent in zebrafish due to its mechanism of inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization. Zoxamide was relatively toxic to zebrafish embryos and larvae, and survival was reduced similar to 50 \% at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) with 10 mu M exposure and over time at 6 dpf, 2.5 mu M exposure reduced survival by similar to 20 \%. Frequency of hatch was also reduced/delayed in zebrafish at 3 dpf with > 2.5 mu M zoxamide. Pericardial edema, body length shortening, and spine curvature were observed in larvae exposed to > 5 mu M. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were assessed in similar to 30 hpf embryos (24-hour exposure) using an XFe24 Flux Analyzer and regression analysis revealed a negative relationship between basal respiration and zoxamide concentration.

Maneb was moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos, and had a 96-h LC(50 )value of 4.29 mu M (similar to 1.14 mg/L).

Larvae exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 mu M maneb showed signs related to hypoactivity, and this reduced activity is hypothesized to be associated with notochord defects as this deformity was prevalent at higher concentrations of maneb. Overall, these data demonstrate that maneb negatively affects embryonic development (i.e. notochord development), affects basal oxygen consumption rates of embryos, and induces hypoactivity in larval fish.

Firstly, clethodim exposure markedly decreased the survival rate, body length, and heart rate and resulted in a series of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and yolk sac edema, in zebrafish larvae. Secondly, the number of immune cells was substantially reduced but the levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon clethodim exposure. Thirdly, we evaluated the expression of some key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappa B p65 and they were all up regulated by exposure to 300 mu g/L clethodim. Meanwhile, some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL8, and IFN-gamma were also activated in both the mock and the TLR4-KD conditions.

In order to evaluate the effect of each molecule on the development of zebrafish embryos/larvae and to select the safest compounds for further study, various phenotypic parameters (i.e., mortality, hatchability, heart rate, heart oedema, yolk sac utilization, swim bladder development and body shape) were observed, and the half maximal lethal concentration, the maximal non-lethal concentration and no observed adverse effect concentration for each compound were established. The effect of all the isopropylated molecules was compared to that of an anticancer agent pemetrexed. The lipophilicity-dependent structure-toxicity correlations were also determined. To establish the possible interaction of the compounds with red blood cells, an ex vivo hemolysis test was performed. It was shown that almost all of the investigated isopropylated congeners have no adverse phenotypic effect on zebrafish development during five-day exposure at concentrations up to 50 mu M (I-III) or up to 20 mu M (IV-V), and that they are less toxic for embryos/larvae than pemetrexed, demonstrating their safety. At the same time, all the molecules did not adversely affect the red blood cells, which confirms their very good hemocompatibility. Moreover, they proved to be activators of apoptotic caspases, as they increased caspase-3, -7 and -9 levels in human breast carcinoma cells. The conducted research allows us to select-from among the anticancer active drug candidates-compounds that are safe for developing zebrafish and red blood cells, suitable for further in vivo pharmacological tests.","","10.3390/molecules27041211","Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Neoplasms",NA,NA

Considering the structural similarity between OPFRs and organophosphate pesticides, hypotheses that OPFRs may interfere with neurodevelopment as organophosphate pesticides are reasonable. In this study, the neurotoxicity of three OPFRs, including tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), was evaluated in zebrafish larvae and then compared with the neurotoxicity of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). The results showed that similar to CPF, exposure to OPFRs for 5 days resulted in significant changes in locomotor behavior, either in free swimming or in photomotor response. However, given the transcriptional changes that occur in nervous system genes in response to OPFRs and CPF, as well as the altered enzyme activity of AChE and its mRNA level, the underlying mechanisms for neurotoxicity among these organophosphate chemicals might be varied. In summary, the results confirm the potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of OPFRs and underscore the importance of identifying the mechanistic targets of the OPFRs with specific moieties. Furthermore, as the neurobehavioral responses are well conserved among vertebrates and the exposure of children to OPFRs is significant, a thorough assessment of the risk of OPFRs exposure during early development should be highly emphasized in future studies.

Consequently, SM exposure resulted in increasing the mortality rate and reducing hatching rate in larval zebrafish at 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent manner. The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1I3, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y, IL-10, and TGF-I3) were measured to estimate immune responses. Anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-I3) were downregulated in all the treated groups and significantly altered at 40 mg/L exposure group. Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that SM treatment significantly increased the total distance, average speed, and maximum acceleration of larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and subsequently enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS level in all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were significantly increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration group induced the substantial increment (P < 0.001) of apoptosis-related genes including p53, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3.

To determine the environmental risk of pesticides, routine ecotoxicological tests are performed on several organisms, including standard fish models. However, these typically do not include fish species from variable habitats and with non-generic life-histories. In particular, inhabitants from temporary ponds such as annual killifish are conventionally understood to be resilient to natural stressors which could translate to higher pesticide resistance or, alternatively, trade-off with their resistance to pesticides and render them more sensitive than classic fish models. Using standard exposure tests, we assessed short-term toxicity effects of two commonly used pesticides, Roundup and cypermethrin, on the annual killifish Nothobranchius neumanni, and compared its sensitivity with that of classic fish models. For Roundup, we found a 72 h-LC50 of 1.79 +/- 0.11 mg/L, which is lower than the values reported for zebrafish, medaka, fathead minnow and rainbow trout, suggesting that N. neumanni is more sensitive to the compound. The opposite was true for cypermethrin, with a 72 h-LC50 of 0.27 +/- 0.03 mg/L. However, these LC50-values do not deviate strongly from those reported for other fish species, supporting earlier findings in the congeneric N. furzeri that the sensitivity of annual killifish to pollutants is similar to that of classic fish models despite their assumed robustness to environmental stress.","","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132823","Pesticides;Prednisolone",NA,NA

Aphantoxins extracted from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. The primary components were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 and neosaxitoxin. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated intraperitoneally with either 53 or 7.61 (low and high doses, respectively) mu g saxitoxin (STX) equivalents (eq)/kg of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Antioxidative responses in zebrafish liver were examined at different timepoints 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin administration significantly enhanced hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content 1-12 h post-exposure, indicative of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in zebrafish liver declined significantly after 3-24 h exposure, suggesting that GSH participates in MDA metabolism. A significant upregulation of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed, suggesting that aphantoxins induce lipid peroxidation in zebrafish liver and are likely to be hepatotoxic. Hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, and of the three enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), therefore provide potential biomarkers for studying environmental exposure to aphantoxins/PSPs from cyanobacterial blooms.

A correlation analysis of a total of 153 compounds identified 28 compounds with a weaker or no toxicity in the fish embryo test. Eleven of these compounds exhibited a neurotoxic mode of action. We selected a subset of eight compounds with weaker or no embryo toxicity (cyanazine, picloram, aldicarb, azinphos-methyl, dieldrin, diquat dibromide, endosulfan, and esfenvalerate) to study toxicokinetics and a neurotoxic mode of action as potential reasons for the deviating fish embryo toxicity. Published fish embryo LC50 values were confirmed by experimental analysis of zebrafish embryo LC50 according to OECD guideline 236. Except for diquat dibromide, internal concentration analysis did not indicate a potential relation of the low sensitivity of fish embryos to a limited uptake of the compounds. Analysis of locomotor activity of diquat dibromide and the neurotoxic compounds in 98 hpf embryos (exposed for 96 h) indicated a specific effect on behavior (embryonic movement) for the neurotoxic compounds. The EC(50)s of behavior for neurotoxic compounds were close to the acute fish toxicity LC50. Our data provided the first evidence that the applicability domain of the fish embryo test (LC(50)s determination) may exclude neurotoxic compounds. However, neurotoxic compounds could be identified by changes in embryonic locomotion. Although a quantitative prediction of acute fish toxicity LC50 using behavioral assays in fish embryos may not yet be possible, the identification of neurotoxicity could trigger the conduction of a conventional fish acute toxicity test or application of assessment factors while considering the very good fish embryo-acute fish toxicity correlation for other compounds.","","10.1021/acs.est.5b01910","Toxicity Tests",NA,NA

Rat models have been key in demonstrating that prenatal CPF exposure causes choice accuracy deficits and motor alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary nonmammalian models can be useful in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the persisting behavioral effects of developmental CPF exposure. Zebrafish with their clear chorion and extensive developmental information base provide an excellent model for assessment of molecular processes of toxicant impacted neurodevelopment. To facilitate the use of the zebrafish model and to compare it to the more typical rodent models, the behavioral phenotype of CPF toxicity in zebrafish must be well characterized. Our laboratory has developed methods for assessing spatial discrimination learning in zebrafish, which can differentiate response latency from choice accuracy in a three chambered fish tank. Low and high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml on days 1-5 postfertilization) both had significant persisting effects on both spatial discrimination and response latency over 18 weeks of testing. The high, but not the low dose, significantly accelerated mortality rates of the fish during the study from 20-38 weeks of age. Developmental exposure to either 10 or 100 ng/ml of CPF caused significant spatial discrimination impairments in zebrafish when they were adults. The impairment caused by 10 ng/ml was seen during early but not later testing, while the impairment caused by 100 ng/ml became more pronounced with continued testing. The higher dose caused a more pervasive impairment. The 10 and 100 ng/ml doses had opposite effects on response latency. The low 10 ng/ml dose significantly slowed response latency, while the high 100 ng/ml dose significant increased response latency. Both of these effects diminished with continued testing. CPF exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments, which lasted throughout adulthood in zebrafish. The molecular mechanisms by which early developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral impairments expressed in adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish model.

This study examined the toxicity targets of CPF in early life stage of zebrafish on the endpoints at developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity. Firstly, CPF exposure decreased the body length, inhibited the hatchability and heart rate, and resulted in a number of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and pericardial edema (PE), in larval zebrafish. Secondly, the free swimming activities and the swimming behaviors of the larvae in response to the stimulation of light-to-dark photoperiod transition were significantly influenced by the exposure to 100 and 300 mu g/L CPF. In addition, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the transcription of some genes related to neurotoxicity were also influenced by CPF exposure. Thirdly, CPF exposure induced oxidative stress in the larval zebrafish. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased and the glutathione (GSH) contents decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner after the exposure to CPF for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). CPF affected not only the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), but also the transcriptional levels of their respective genes. Finally, the mRNA levels of the main cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf alpha), interferon (Ifn), interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta), interleukin 6 (116), complement factor 4 (C4) in the larvae increased significantly after the exposure to 100 or 300 mu g/L CPF for 96 hpf, suggesting that the innate immune system disturbed by CPF in larvae. Taken together, our results suggested that CPF had the potential to cause developmental toxicity, behavior alterations, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in the larval zebrafish.

Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation was demonstrated when exposed to HEX of 100 and 200 mu g L-1, finding that the ()-enantiomer tended to accumulate in zebrafish more easily than (+)-enantiomer. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and GSH content were all significantly decreased when zebrafish were exposed to 50 and 200 mu g L-1 HEX for 21 d. A series of genes of the apoptosis pathway were examined in groups treated with 50 and 200 mu g L-1 HEX for 21 d using real-time PCR. Significant up-regulation of p53, Puma, Apaf-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio were proved.

As the diameter distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale (similar to 27 mu m), the capsules released more slowly and sunk more quickly in water. In addition, micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in significantly less fish mortality and malformations of larvae and embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The highest accumulation of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae suggested that the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would pose unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms.

Using Sprague-Dawley rats, we examined behavioral and molecular biology effects associated with maternal ATR exposure, as well as the effects of 8 or 28 days swimming training. Maternal exposure to ATR was found to impair spatial learning and memory by behavioral test, damage the hippocampal morphology, and reduce related genes and proteins expression of learning and memory in the hippocampus. The extended, 28 days, period of swimming training produced a greater amelioration of the adverse effects of ATR exposure than the shorter, 8 days, training period.

As a consequence, natural resource managers must often weigh the ecological benefits of using herbicides to control nonnative plants against the potential for unintended toxicological impacts on salmonids, particularly during early life stages. However, the effects of chemical control agents on fish development have not been widely investigated. Their use in the vicinity of aquatic habitats, including areas that support threatened and endangered species, is therefore a concern. To address this uncertainty, we used the zebrafish Dania rerio as a model experimental system for investigating developmental toxicity, which involved conducting rapid and sensitive phenotypic screens for potential developmental defects resulting from exposure to six herbicides (picloram, clopyralid, imazapic, glyphosate, imazapyr, and triclopyr) and several technical formulations (Tordon K, Transline, Habitat, Plateau, Garlon 3A, and Renovate). Zebrafish embryos were exposed continuously through 5 d of development at nominal concentrations ranging from 3 mu g/L to 10 mg/L. Detailed screens were used to examine aspects of ontogeny from early development (gastrulation and segmentation) through organogenesis, hatching, and morphology as free-swimming larvae. Growth was measured at the end of each exposure interval. To detect defects in neural development (sensorimotor integration), the escape reflex of larvae was monitored at 3, 4, and 5 d after fertilization. No developmental toxicity was observed in response to the six individual herbicides or the different technical formulations. The absence of toxicity at relatively high exposure concentrations suggests that noxious weed control activities are not likely to pose a direct threat to the health of salmonids at early life stages.","","10.1577/M08-173.1","Phenotype",NA,NA

Under TCPP gradient concentration exposure, the hatching rates were declined by up to 33.3\% in 72 hpf, and the malformation rates increased from 15\% to 50\%. Meanwhile, TCPP led to abnormal behaviors including decreased locomotive activity in the dark and slow/insensitive responses to sound and light stimulation of larvae. TCPP caused excessive apoptosis and ROS accumulation in early embryonic development, with hair cell defects and structural deformity of neuromast. Abnormal expression of neurodevelopment (pax6a, nova1, sox11b, syn2a, foxo3a and robo2) and apoptosis-related genes (baxa, bcl2a and casp8) revealed molecular mechanisms regarding abnormal behavioral and phenotypic symptoms. Chronic TCPP exposure led to anxiety-like behavior and excessive panic, lower capacity for discrimination and risk avoidance, and conditioned place preference in adults. Social interaction tests demonstrated that long-term TCPP stress resulted in unsociable, eccentric, lonely and silent behaviors in adults. Zebrafish memory and cognitive function were severely reduced as concluded fromT-maze tests. Potential mechanisms triggering behavioral abnormality were attributed to histopathological injury of diencephalon, abnormal changes in nerve-related genes at transcription and expression levels, and inhibited activity of AChE by TCPP stress. These findings provide an important reference for risk assessment and early warning to TCPP exposure, and offer insights for prevention/mitigation of pollutant-induced nervous system diseases.

A clear distinction of MoAs based on locomotor patterns was not possible for most compounds. Furthermore, chemicals with an anticipated same MoA did not necessarily provoke similar behavioral phenotypes. Finally, we determined an increased sensitivity (>= 10-fold) compared to observed mortality in the LMR assay for five of eight neuroactive chemicals as opposed to non-neuroactive compounds.","","10.1021/acs.est.8b04327","",NA,NA

PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days (one injection every 3 days). PQ-treated group showed a significant decrease in the time spent in the bottom section and a shorter latency to enter the top area in the novel tank test.

PQ induced brain damage by decreasing mitochondrial viability. Concerning the antioxidant defense system, PQ increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as the non-protein sulfhydryl content (NPSH), but did not change ROS formation and decreased lipid peroxidation. We demonstrate, for the first time, that PQ induces an increase in aggressive behavior, alters non-motor patterns associated to defensive behaviors, and changes redox parameters in zebrafish brain.

Linuron is a phenylurea herbicide used to control a wide variety of vegetative weeds in agriculture in addition to residential applications. However, there are few studies that quantify its toxicity to early developmental stages of fish. The objectives of this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to zebrafish embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities, oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the Visual Motor Response test. Zebrafish embryos at similar to 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one dose of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mu M linuron for up to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) depending on the assay. Zebrafish larvae exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using the Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf embryos at 20 mu M after a 24-hour exposure. In 7 dpf larvae, transcript abundance was determined for 6 transcripts that have a role in oxidative respiration (atp06, cox1, cox4-1, cox5a1, cytb, and nd1); the relative abundance of these transcripts was not altered with linuron treatment. A Visual Motor Response test was conducted on 7 dpf larvae to determine whether linuron (0.625 to 5 mu M) impaired locomotor activity. Larval activity in the dark period decreased in a dose dependent manner and there were indications of hypoactivity as low as 1.25 mu M. Transcript abundance was thus determined for tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad1b), two rate limiting enzymes that control the production of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. The mRNA levels of gad1b = 0.019) were reduced with increasing concentrations of linuron while th1 (p = 0.056) showed a similar decreasing trend, suggesting that neurotransmitter biosynthesis may be altered with exposure to linuron. This study improves knowledge related to the toxicity mechanisms for linuron and is the first to demonstrate that this anti-androgenic chemical impairs oxidative respiration and exerts neurotoxic effects associated with neurotransmitter biosynthesis during early development. These data are significant for environmental risk assessment of agrochemicals.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2020.106917","",NA,NA

Rat models have been key in demonstrating that developmental CPF exposure causes learning deficits and locomotor activity alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary nonmammalian models can be useful in determining the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying these persisting behavioral effects. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) with their clear chorion and extensive developmental information base provide an excellent model for assessment of molecular processes of toxicant-impacted neurodevelopment. We have developed methods for assessing spatial discrimination learning in adult zebrafish and have documented persisting effects of developmental CPF exposure on swimming activity and learning after low and high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml) administered to zebrafish embryos on Days 1-5 postfertilization (pf). In the current study, we developed methods for behavioral assessment of CPF exposure on swimming activity in newly hatched zebrafish. An equal area segmented annular grid (concentric circles divided into quadrants through the diameter) was made in a 16-mm diameter cylinder. The test area was placed on a heating device secured to an Olympus SZH 10 dissecting scope stage. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 10 ng/ml CPF, 100 ng/ml CPF, or vehicle control (25 {[}mul/ml DMSO) (n=8-10/treatment group). Each treatment group was kept in a total volume of 25 ml of egg water (60 mg/ml Instant Ocean) including DMSO with or without CPF mixed to above dilutions in an incubator set at 28.5degreesC. CPF dilutions or vehicle were changed daily with exposure ending on Day 5 pf. Testing of larval zebrafish was performed on Days 6 and 9 pf. The fish were placed in the test cylinder with 1.5 ml of egg H(2)0 (28.5degreesC). After a 2-min acclimation period, the swimming activity of the fish was measured for a 3-min testing session. The 100 ng/ml CPF dose caused significant slowing of swimming activity on Days 6 and 9 pf and had persisting effects of impairing spatial discrimination and decreasing response latency in adulthood. Developmental exposure to 10 ng/ml of CPF did not cause a significant change in locomotor activity during the period soon after hatching. CPF exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments detectable during the posthatching period. In a previous study, we found that early developmental CPF exposure caused behavioral alterations in zebrafish, which lasted throughout adulthood.

The enantioselective behaviors of dinotefuran to aquatic organisms have not been reported, and the effects of cadmium (Cd) was absent, which were investigated in this study at environmentally relevant concentrations. The enantioselective accumulation and elimination of dinotefuran enantiomers were observed in zebrafish, and it had tissue specificity. The S-dinotefuran concentrations were higher than R-dinotefuran in heads and viscera, but it was opposite in muscles. There existed competition between S-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran, and the existence of S-dinotefuran might decrease the accumulation and elimination of the R-dinotefuran in zebrafish. When co-exposure to Cd and dinotefuran, the accumulation concentrations of dinotefuran enantiomers increased in zebrafish at the initial stage, which were opposite latterly. The accumulation concentrations of R-dinotefuran in R + Cd treatment in fish were 3.4 times higher than those in R-dinotefuran treatment, and the enantiomer fraction (EF) values changed from 0.484 to 0.195. The oxidative stress of S-dinotefuran on zebrafish was highest, followed by rac- and R-dinotefuran. Coexposure to Cd led to toxicity increase for R-dinotefuran, the malonaldehyde (MDA) content decreased significantly in R + Cd treatment during 7-28 days, while obvious declination of MDA contents was found on the 28th day in R-dinotefuran treatment. Furthermore, compared to R-dinotefuran treatment, Cd increased the relative expression of cz-sod (3.4 times), cas3 (1.6 times) and p53 (5.7 times) in R + Cd treatment. The co-exposure of Cd might alter the environmental behaviors and toxicity effects of dinotefuran enantiomers in zebrafish, including the enantioselectivity. The effects of Cd on accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran were greater than those on S-dinotefuran.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate carbendazim metabolites in zebrafish water tank using liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) to highlight analytical targets in order to monitor carbendazim exposure in aquatic environments. For this purpose, treatment, negative and stability groups were defined. In addition, water samples were collected from the tanks and analyses were carried out by LC-HRMS. The results allowed the putative annotation of 7 target metabolites. This study applied the analysis of zebrafish water tank for evaluation of target metabolites of carbendazim as a promising approach, since it is a much cleaner matrix than the usual biological matrices. These metabolites can ensure detectability and further strengthen confidence in monitoring carbendazim exposure in aquatic environments. To the best of our knowledge, there is no one study that has evaluated carbendazim metabolites produced by zebrafish, neither in the animal's body nor in the water tank.

Exposure to acetochlor at concentrations 50 mu M and above exerted 100\% mortality after 3 dpf, and significantly reduced the size of the swim bladder (25 mu M). In embryos, basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production, and maximal respiration were decreased 30-60\% following a 24 h exposure to 125 mu M acetochlor. Acetochlor did not affect ROS levels up to 25 mu M in larvae with acute exposure. Acetochlor at 25 mu M increased mRNA levels of bax1, hsp70, and hsp90a by similar to 4-fold in larval zebrafish. In both the visual motor response and light-dark preference test, 25 mu M acetochlor increased locomotor activity of larval fish.

These realities coupled with the green chemistry movement have prompted efforts to implement more predictive-based approaches to evaluate chemical toxicity early in product development. While used for many years in environmental toxicology and biomedicine, zebrafish use has accelerated more recently in genetic toxicology, high throughput screening (HTS), and behavioral testing. This review describes major advances in these testing methods that have positioned the zebrafish as a highly applicable model in chemical safety evaluations and sustainable chemistry efforts. Many toxic responses have been shown to be shared among fish and mammals owing to their generally well-conserved development, cellular networks, and organ systems. These shared responses have been observed for chemicals that impair endocrine functioning, development, and reproduction, as well as those that elicit cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity, among other diseases. HTS technologies with zebrafish enable screening large chemical libraries for bioactivity that provide opportunities for testing early in product development. A compelling attribute of the zebrafish centers on being able to characterize toxicity mechanisms across multiple levels of biological organization from the genome to receptor interactions and cellular processes leading to phenotypic changes such as developmental malformations.

The major target of TETS was recently identified as the GABAAR alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2 subtype in electrophysiological studies using recombinantly expressed receptor combinations. Here, we tested whether these in vitro findings translate in vivo by comparing the efficacy of GABAAR subunit-selective PAMs in reducing TETS-induced seizure behavior in larval zebrafish. We tested PAMs targeting alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 2/3/5, alpha 6, ss2/3, ss1/2/3, and delta subunits and compared their efficacy to the benzodiazepine midazolam (MDZ). The data demonstrate that alpha 2- and alpha 6-selective PAMs (SL-651,498 and SB-205384, respectively) were effective at mitigating TETS-induced seizure-like behavior. Combinations of SB-205384 and MDZ or SL-651,498 and 2-261 (ss2/3-selective) mitigated TETS-induced seizure-like behavior at concentrations that did not elicit sedating effects in a photomotor behavioral assay, whereas MDZ alone caused sedation at the concentration required to stop seizure behavior. Isobologram analyses suggested that SB-205384 and MDZ interacted in an antagonistic fashion, while the effects of SL-651,498 and 2-261 were additive. These results further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TETS induces seizures and provide mechanistic insight regarding specific countermeasures against this chemical convulsant.","","10.1016/j.taap.2021.115643","gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Seizures",NA,NA

Methods This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Results CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10-14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (<= 1.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition. Conclusions Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms. Variability in laboratories, exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal species/strain might have contributed to the inconsistent results. The detrimental CPF effects during early development are relevant to human populations.","","10.1002/bdr2.1661","Rodentia",NA,NA

Through direct interactions with thyroid receptors, an/or indirectly via up-stream signalling pathways, from the HPT axis (i.e., negative feedback regulation), malathion possess the ability to affect integrity of thyroidal follicular tissue, and it can also block or delay its hormonal functioning. This insecticide can alter the majority of the ontogenetic processes, inducing several deformities, and also provoking decreases in the growth and survival patterns. The present study has been performed to determine the sublethal effects of malathion during the first month of life of the Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis, and it is mainly focused on the metamorphosis phase. Different transcript expression levels (i.e. thyroid receptors, matrix and bone -Gla-proteins) and immunohistochemical patterns (i.e. thyroid hormones, osteocalcin, cell proliferation) have been analysed during the most critical phases of the flatfish metamorphosis, that is, through differentiation of thyroid system and skeletal development, migration of the eye, and further adaptation to benthic behaviours.ResultsIn early life stages of the Senegalese sole, the exposure to the highest concentration of malathion (6.25g/L) affected to the growth patterns, showing the exposed individuals, a reduction around 60 and 92\% of the total length and the dry weigth, respectively. In paralell, a significant reduction of the thyroid follicles (i.e., size and number) it was also been recorded, in a dose-dependent way. Abnormal phenotypes induced in the exposed larvae, did not complete the process of metamorphosis, and displayed several morphological abnormalities and developmental disorders, which were mainly associated with the eye migration process, and with thyroidal and skeletal disorders (i.e., transcriptional and protein changes of thyroid hormones and receptors, and of matrix and bone Gla proteins distribution), that conduced to an inadequate adaptation to the benthic life.ConclusionsIn the Senegalese sole, the majority of the ontogenetic alterations induced by the exposure to malathion were mainly associated to the metamorphosis period, which is a thyroid-driven proccess. In fact, most crucial and transitional ontogenic events, appeared notably disturbed, for e.g., thyroid gland differentiation and functioning, migration of eye, skeletal development and benthonic behaviors.","","10.1186/s12917-019-1786-z","Pesticides;Organophosphates",NA,NA

Thus, it was our intention to evaluate neurobehavioral activities of ornate wrasses (Thalassoma pavo) exposed to 0.2 mg/I of mz after a preliminary screening test (0.07-0.3 mg/I). Treated fish exhibited an evident (p < 0.001) latency to reach T-maze arms (> 1000\%) while exploratory attitudes (total arm entries) diminished ( 50\%; p < 0.05) versus controls during spontaneous exploration tests. Moreover, they showed evident enhancements (+ 111\%) of immobility in the cylinder test.

Conversely, wrasses displayed evident enhancements (160\%) of risk assessment consisting of fast entries in the dark side of this apparatus. From a molecular point of view, a notable activation (p < 0.005) of the brain transcription factor pCREB occurred during mz-exposure.

TF is a potential endocrine disruptor that may interfere with sex steroid hormones, such as testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E-2). In our study, the lizards Mongolia Racerunner (Eremias argus) were orally exposed to TF and its enantiomers for 21 days. Plasma sex steroid hormones and steroidogenic-related genes, including 17-beta-hydroxysteroid (hsd17 beta), cytochrome P450 enzymes (cyp19 and cyp17), and steroid hormone receptors (era and Ar) were evaluated. After exposure, the plasma testosterone level in the 100 mg/kg(bw) group was elevated, while the oestradiol level was reduced. This phenomenon may be caused by the transformation of cyp19, which may inhibit the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol and affect sexual behaviour. In addition, the two enantiomers have different effects on hormone levels, which testified to the previously reported biotoxic dissimilarity between TF1 and TF2 in organisms. Furthermore, the cyp19 mRNA level in liver and gonad of the TF2 and TF group (100 mg/kg(bw) were significantly down-regulated, while the cyp17 and hsd17 beta mRNA levels were up-regulated. The expression of era and Ar mRNA levels were up-regulated in males but not in females, which may indicate that TF has sex differences on these two genes.

This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of PQ to Chironomus riparius and Girardia tigrina, and compare their physiological strategies to cope with environmental stress. The mean emergence time was the most sensitive endpoint for Chironomids, with the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) being 0.02 for males and 0.1 mg PQ L-1 for females. Moreover, PQ reduced the body weight of male and female imagoes, with LOECs of 0.5 and 2.5 mg PQ L-1, respectively. Paraquat also decreased the respiration rate (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) and total glutathione (tGSH) content (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1). Thus, the aerobic production of energy was not affected and allowed chironomids to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ, but with consequent physiological costs in terms of development rates and weight of adults. In planarians, PQ decreased the locomotion and feeding activity, and delayed photoreceptor regeneration (LOECs = 2.5 mg PQ L-1 for all endpoints).

Na2SeO3 prevented the increase of carbonylated protein (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as the decrease in non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant enzymatic defenses, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary Na2SeO3 improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment in zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety- and aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.","","10.1007/s12035-017-0441-6","Sodium Selenite;Sodium",NA,NA

Using transgenic zebrafish (flil:egfp) that stably express eGFP beginning at similar to 14 hpf, we have developed and optimized a 384-well-based HCS assay that quantifies spontaneous activity Within single zebrafish embryos after exposure to test chemicals in a concentration-response format. Following static exposure of one embryo per well from 5 to 25 hpf, automated image acquisition procedures and custom analysis protocols were used to quantify total body area and spontaneous activity in live embryos. Survival and imaging success rates across control plates ranged from 87.5 to 100\% and 93.3-100\%, respectively. Using our optimized procedures, we screened 16 chemicals within the US EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library, and found that exposure to abamectin and emamectin benzoate-both potent avermectins-abolished spontaneous activity in the absence of gross malformations.

OBJECTIVE: We studied the mechanisms of zirams (a DTC fungicide) neurotoxicity in vivo. METHODS: Zebrafish (ZF) embryos were utilized to determine zirams effects on behavior, neuronal toxicity, and the role of synuclein in its toxicity. RESULTS: Nanomolar-range concentrations of ziram caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior. Because ziram increases alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF gamma-synuclein 1 (gamma 1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms, and ZF gamma 1 appears to be the closest functional homologue to alpha-syn. We found that recombinant ZF gamma 1 formed fibrils in vitro, and overexpression of ZF gamma 1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity in a manner similar to that of alpha-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF gamma 1 with morpholinos and disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 prevented zirams DA toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ziram is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo, and this toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which pesticides may cause PD.","","10.1289/EHP141","Pesticides;Parkinson Disease",NA,NA

Juvenile salmon were exposed to waterborne TCEP or TBOEP (0.04, 0.2 and 1 mg/L) for 7 days. The muscle accumulation was measured and bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated, showing that TCEP was less accumulative and resistant to metabolism in salmon than TBOEP. Metabolite formations were only detected in TBOEP-exposed fish, showing seven phase I biotransformation metabolites with hydroxylation, ether cleavage or combination of both reactions as important metabolic pathways. In vitro incubation of trout S9 liver fraction with TBOEP was performed showing that the generated metabolite patterns were similar to those found in muscle tissue exposed in vivo. However, another OH-TBOEP isomer and an unidentified metabolite not present in in vivo exposure were observed with the trout S9 incubation. Overall, some of the observed metabolic products were similar to those in a previous in vitro report using human liver microsomes and some metabolites were identified for the first time in the present study. Toxicological analysis indicated that TBOEP produced less effect, although it was taken up faster and accumulated more in fish muscle than TCEP.

By determining the linkages between toxicity events at different levels, AOPs lay the foundation for mechanism-based alternative testing approaches to hazard assessment. Here, we focus on growth impairment in fish to illustrate the initial stages in the process of AOP development for chronic toxicity outcomes. Growth is an apical endpoint commonly assessed in chronic toxicity tests for which a replacement is desirable. Based on several criteria, we identified reduction in food intake to be a suitable key event for initiation of middle-out AOP development. To start exploring the upstream and downstream links of this key event, we developed three AOP case studies, for pyrethroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and cadmium. Our analysis showed that the effect of pyrethroids and SSRIs on food intake is strongly linked to growth impairment, while cadmium causes a reduction in growth due to increased metabolic demands rather than changes in food intake. Locomotion impairment by pyrethroids is strongly linked to their effects on food intake and growth, while for SSRIs their direct influence on appetite may play a more important role. We further discuss which alternative tests could be used to inform on the predictive key events identified in the casp studies. In conclusion, our work demonstrates how the AOP concept can be used in practice to assess critically the knowledge available for specific chronic toxicity cases and to identify existing knowledge gaps and potential alternative tests.

The aggregation test showed that tadpoles exposed to the highest ABA concentrations did not respond to the stimulus from non-familial and unrelated co-specific species. On the other hand, there was no difference in the total number of crossings in the central line of the herein adopted apparatus between groups; it suggests that ABA did not affect animal locomotion in the aforementioned test, although changes in the normal swimming pattern of tadpoles exposed to the pesticide were recorded in the swimming activity test. In addition, the herein exposed animals did not respond to the predatory stimulus in the antipredator response test; this result suggests defensive response deficit caused by the pesticide. With respect to their oral morphology, tadpoles exposed to ABA presented the lowest scores for mandibular pigmentation and structures, as well as for dentition condition. Finally, it was possible seeing that the exposure to ABA, even at the lowest concentration (12.5\% of the LC50), resulted in nuclear changes in the erythrocytes of the animals; these changes became evident in the increased number of micronuclei and in other nuclear abnormalities. Thus, besides confirming the cytotoxic potential of ABA in amphibians, the current study corroborates the hypothesis that the exposure to the herein investigated pesticide leads to behavioral and morphological changes in tadpoles, fact that may negatively reflect on the survival, as well as on natural populations of these individuals.","","10.1007/s11356-018-1562-9","Biological Markers",NA,NA

In this study, the effects of CA inhibitors, i.e., sulfonamides {[}ethoxyzolamide (EZA), acetazolamide (AZA), and dorzolamide (DZA)], on zebrafish embryogenesis were investigated. In embryos treated with the sulfonamides, abnormal development, such as smaller otoliths, an enlarged heart, an irregular pectoral fin, and aberrant swimming behavior, was observed. Especially, the development of otoliths and locomotor activity was severely affected by all the sulfonamides, and EZA was a consistently stronger inhibitor than AZA or DZA. In the embryos treated with EZA, inner ear hair cells containing several CA isoforms, which provide HCO3 (-) to the endolymph for otolith calcification and maintain an appropriate pH there, were affected. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining indicated that the hair cell damage in the inner ear and pectral fin is due to apoptosis. Moreover, RNA measurement demonstrated that altered gene expression of cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-related proteins p53, p21, p27, and Bcl-2 occurred even at 0.08 ppm with which normal development was observed. This finding suggests that a low concentration of EZA may affect embryogenesis via the apoptosis pathway.

Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory).

Although studies in the neonatal murine spinal cord in vitro suggest an early locomotor role of the DDT, the function of the DDT in developing vertebrates in vivo remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the DDT in the locomotor development of zebrafish larvae. To assess the development of the behavioral and neural locomotor pattern, we used high-throughput video tracking in combination with peripheral nerve recordings. We found a behavioral and neural correspondence in the developmental switch from an immature to mature locomotor pattern. Blocking endogenous dopamine receptor 4 (D4R) signaling in vivo either before or after the developmental switch prevented or reversed the switch, respectively. Spinal transections of post-switch larvae reestablished the immature locomotor pattern, which was rescued to a mature-like pattern via spinal D4R agonism. Selective chemogenetic ablation of otp b (otpb) neurons that contribute to the DDT perpetuated the immature locomotor pattern in vivo. This phenotype was recapitulated by diencephalic transections that removed the dopaminergic otpb population and was rescued to a mature-like locomotor pattern by D4R agonism. We conclude that the dopaminergic otpb population, via the DDT, is responsible for spinal D4R signaling to mediate the developmental switch to the mature locomotor pattern of zebrafish. These results, integrated with the mammalian literature, suggest that the DDT represents an evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory system that is necessary for normal vertebrate locomotor development.","","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1638-12.2012","",NA,NA

In this manuscript we show that 24 h exposure to environmental concentrations of fenitrothion, from ng/L to low mu g/L, altered basal locomotor activity, visual-motor response and acoustic/vibrational escape response of zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, fenitrothion and expression of gap43a, gfap, atp2b1a, and mbp exhibited a significant non-monotonic concentration-response relationship. Once determined that environmental concentrations of fenitrothion were neurotoxic for zebrafish larvae, a computational analysis identified potential protein targets of this compound. Some of the predictions, including interactions with acetylcholinesterase, monoamine-oxidases and androgen receptor (AR), were experimentally validated. Binding to AR was the most suitable candidate for molecular initiating event, as indicated by both the up-regulation of cyp19a1b and sult2st3 and the non-monotonic relationship found between fenitrothion and the observed responses. Finally, when the integrity of the monoaminergic system was evaluated, altered levels of L-DOPA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA were found, as well as a significant up-regulation of slc18a2 expression at the lowest concentrations of fenitrothion.

To investigate the bioconcentration of HBCD in tissues (muscle and liver) and its biochemical and behavioural effects, juvenile crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were exposed to different concentrations of technical HBCD (nominal concentrations, 2, 20, 200 mu g/L) for 7 days, using a flow-through exposure system.

At the genus level, approximately 25 types of bacteria in the gut changed significantly. In addition, based on a gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, we found that 98 metabolites significantly influenced the zebrafish liver, and these changed metabolites were tightly related to several pathways, including glucose and lipid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of some genes related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism decreased significantly in the livers of CPF-treated zebrafish. These results indicated that CPF exposure could induce hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in adult zebrafish.

Herein, we describe the suitability of the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a new animal model for the study of developmental neurotoxicology. As these asexual animals reproduce by binary fission, followed by regeneration of missing body structures within approximately 1 week, development and regeneration occur through similar processes allowing us to induce neurodevelopment ``at will{''} through amputation. This short time scale and the comparable sizes of full and regenerating animals enable parallel experiments in adults and developing worms to determine development-specific aspects of toxicity. Because the planarian brain, despite its simplicity, is structurally and molecularly similar to the mammalian brain, we are able to ascertain neurodevelopmental toxicity that is relevant to humans. As a proof of concept, we developed a 5-step semiautomatic screening platform to characterize the toxicity of 9 known neurotoxicants (consisting of common solvents, pesticides, and detergents) and a neutral agent, glucose, and quantified effects on viability, stimulated and unstimulated behavior, regeneration, and brain structure. Comparisons of our findings with other alternative toxicology animal models, such as zebrafish larvae and nematodes, demonstrated that planarians are comparably sensitive to the tested chemicals. In addition, we found that certain compounds induced adverse effects specifically in developing animals. We thus conclude that planarians offer new complementary opportunities for developmental neurotoxicology animal models.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfv129","Animals;Animal Shells",NA,NA

Eleuthero-embryos exposed to picrotoxin, a known gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor inhibitor, exhibited similar adverse outcomes to ToCP exposure. Thus, our results demonstrated that the TCP mode of toxic action was isomer specific and not initially related to modulation of PV-NTE activity.

Exposed embryos showed a marked decrease in the hatching rate and many malformations (cardiac and yolk sac oedema and spinal torsions), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration. A dose-dependent decreased locomotor activity and a response to an aversive stimulus, as well as a light-dark transition decline, were observed at environmental relevant concentrations.

Here we show that motor abnormalities prior to neuronal loss in this model are associated with extensive alpha-Synuclein-dependent cellular thiol oxidation. In order to elucidate the underlying events in vivo we constructed novel transgenic zebrafish that co-express, in dopaminergic neurons: (i) human alpha-Synuclein at levels insufficient to provoke neurodegeneration or neurobehavioral abnormalities; and (ii) genetically-encoded ratiometric fluorescent biosensors to detect cytoplasmic peroxide flux and glutathione oxidation. Live intravital imaging of the intact zebrafish CNS at cellular resolution showed unequivocally that alpha-Synuclein amplified dynamic cytoplasmic peroxide flux in dopaminergic neurons following exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitors MPP + or rotenone. This effect was robust and clearly evident following either acute or prolonged exposure to each inhibitor. In addition, disturbance of the resting glutathione redox potential following exogenous hydrogen peroxide challenge was augmented by alpha-Synuclein. Together these data show that alpha-Synuclein is a critical determinant of the redox consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. The findings are important because the mechanisms underlying alpha-Synuclein-dependent reactive oxygen species fluxes and antioxidant suppression might provide a pharmacological target in Parkinson's disease to prevent progression from mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress to cell death.","","10.1016/j.redox.2020.101695","Oxidative Stress",32905883,NA

Further experiments showed no significant decreases in locomotion (p 0.05), hunger motivation (p > 0.05), and a visually guided startle response (p > 0.05), in all treatment groups tested as compared to controls. This suggests that 2,4-D in WAM40 does not inhibit feed associated learning behaviors via interaction with these mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to cognitive functions that control essential behaviors of yellow perch.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105909","Association Learning",NA,NA

Results revealed that increased malformation, decreased body length and heart rate, affected spontaneous movement and swimming speed provide a gradual concentration-dependent manner; values of 144 h LC50 (median lethal concentration) and EC50 (median effective concentration) were 1.11 and 0.86 mu g L-1. Continuous exposure to TFS resulted in a steady accumulation with no evidence of elimination. Enzyme activities were significantly changed; reactive oxygen species and DNA damage were significantly induced after TFS treatment. Certain genes related to cell apoptosis (p53), metabolism (cyp1a), stress response (hsp70) and blood vessels (vezf1) development were all significantly up-regulated. This is the first study to define uptake kinetics and to focus on behavioral consequences, physiological changes and mRNA expression following TFS exposure in the early life stages of fish. Our results suggest that TFS is highly toxic to fish embryos. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.07.100","RNA, Messenger;Kinetics",NA,NA

Insignificant alterations of these parameters may compromise this response. In addition, these parameters can additionally alter chemical compounds by inducing their degradation, producing thereafter other metabolites. Understanding the combined effects of chemicals and environmental parameters is absolutely necessary for an adequate prediction of risk in aquatic environments. According to this scenario, this work aims at studying the combined toxicity of UVR and three xenobiotics: the biocide tridosan (TCS), the metal chromium (as potassium dichromate, PD) and the fungicide prochloraz (PCZ). To achieve this goal zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (3 h post fertilization (hpf)) were exposed to several concentrations of each chemical combined with different UV intensities; mortality and eggs were recorded every 24 h for the all test duration (96 h). Results showed different response patterns depending on the toxicant, stress levels and duration of exposure. The combination of UVR and TCS indicated a dose ratio deviation where synergism was observed when UVR was the dominant stressor (day 2). The combination of UVR and PD presented a dose level dependency at day 3 indicating antagonism at low stress levels, changing with time where at day 4, a dose ratio deviation showed statistically that synergism occurred at higher PD concentrations. Finally, UVR combined with PCZ indicated a dose ratio at day 3 and dose level deviation at day 4 of exposure, suggesting a synergistic response when PCZ is the dominant stressor in the combination. The obtained results in this study highlighted the importance of taking into account the possible interaction of stressors and time of exposure to better predict environmental risk.

Both were exposed to 5, 10, or 20 mg/L acetochlor. We found that acetochlor induced developmental abnormalities, locomotion variations and changes in the physiology and gene expression in the embryos and larvae. The abnormalities included spinal curvature, brain abnormalities, and the decreased formation of newborn neurons. Larval locomotion was decreased with increases in the absolute turn angle and sinuosity. Acetylcholinesterase activity reduced in both embryos and larvae, and the expression of genes that are involved in neurodevelopment and the neurotransmitter system altered. Acetochlor increased the production of ROS and the accumulation of MDA but decreased CAT activity in the embryonic brain. Additionally, acetochlor induced cell death in the brain and tail spinal cord, and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl2 and caspase 3 were significantly upregulated. Collectively, this is the first study to examine the molecular and physiological effects of acetochlor on neuronal development, and the potential mechanisms appear to be associated with oxidative stress and decreased AChE activity, which disrupt the expression of nervous system genes and apoptosis-related genes and finally lead to apoptosis and morphological malformations.

Therefore, in this study, zebrafish embryos (2-120 h post-fertilization {[}hpf]) were exposed to TCIPP or TCEP (0, 100, 500 or 2500 mu g/L) or a model neurotoxicant, chlorpyrifos (CPF, 100 mu g/L) to investigate the adverse effects and possible mechanisms of TCIPP and TCEP on neurodevelopment. Our results showed that CPF exposure resulted in developmental toxicity including decreased hatching, survival rates and increased malformation rates (e.g., spinal curvature) as well as behavior changes such as decreased locomotive activity in dark stimulation. In contrast, TCIPP and TCEP showed no significant effects on developmental parameters, but caused similar effects on locomotive activity at high concentration, indicating that although not as potent as CPF. TCIPP and TCEP may still cause adverse effects on neurodevelopment. Furthermore, our results suggest that TCIPP and TCEP showed no effects on acetylcholine content or AChE activity, which were considered as the main targets of CPF. However, TCIPP and TCEP exposure can significantly down regulate the expression of selected genes and proteins related to neurodevelopment (e.g., mbp, syn2a, and alpha 1-tubulin) similar as CPF did. Besides that, TCIPP and TCEP can also affect the transcription of shha and gap43, which were not affected by CPF, pointing out a complex mechanism underlying TCIPP and TCEP's neurodevelopmental toxicity.

As a proof of concept, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the action of two common neurotoxic pesticides, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) and imidacloprid, over their effects on arousal and habituation of the escape response were studied by using pharmacological antagonists of the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, mecamylamine (MCA) and scopolamine, respectively. Furthermore, potential changes in the neurotransmitter profile were analyzed. Results revealed that whereas the effect of CPO on arousal was mainly mediated by the activation of nAChRs, its effect on habituation was mainly mediated by mAChRs. On the other hand, imidacloprid only affected larvae arousal which was found to be mediated by a cholinergic independent mechanism. No association between behavioral effects on arousal or habituation in affected larvae was found with their corresponding neurotransmitter profile.

In this study, we showed that after only 24 h of exposure to environmental concentrations of carbaryl (0.066-660 ng/L), zebrafish larvae exhibit impairments in essential behaviours. Interestingly, the observed behavioural effects induced by carbaryl were acetylcholinesterase-independent. To elucidate the molecular initiating event that resulted in the observed behavioural effects, in silico predictions were followed by in vitro validation. We identified two target proteins that potentially interacted with carbaryl, the alpha 2B adrenoceptor (ADRA2B) and the serotonin 2B receptor (HTR2B). Using a pharmacological approach, we then tested the hypothesis that carbaryl had antagonistic interactions with both receptors. Similar to yohimbine and SB204741, which are prototypic antagonists of ADRA2B and HTR2B, respectively, carbaryl increased the heart rate of zebrafish larvae. When we compared the behavioural effects of a 24-h exposure to these pharmacological antagonists with those of carbaryl, a high degree of similarity was found. These results strongly suggest that antagonism of both ADRA2B and HTR2B is the molecular initiating event that leads to adverse outcomes in zebrafish larvae that have undergone 24 h of exposure to environmentally relevant levels of carbaryl.","","10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128563","",NA,NA

There are few relevant studies at present. In this study, the effects of three surfactants on the degradation of the amide pesticide metolachlor in water-sediment system were investigated. The study found that the three surfactants had no significant effect on the degradation of metolachlor in the system at environmental concentrations. However, at critical micelle concentration, cationic surfactant octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and nonionic surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ether promoted the degradation of metolachlor in water-sediment system. Anionic surfactant odium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) prolonged the degradation half-life of metolachlor. The presence of surfactants not only affected the environmental behavior of pesticides. When they coexisted with pesticides, the joint toxicity to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored. This study found that the combined effects of three surfactants and metolachlor on the acute developmental toxicity of zebrafish embryos were all synergistic effects. The combined effects of two ionic surfactants and metolachlor on the acute toxicity of adult zebrafish were synergistic effects. Further study showed that co-exposure of SDBS and metolachlor increased the absorption of metolachlor by zebrafish. Combined exposure of SDBS and metolachlor caused oxidative stress in brain, gill and liver of zebrafish.

Sublethal and lethal effects were monitored during the exposure period from 2 h post fertilisation (hpf) to 96 hpf after exposure to azoxystrobin concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1). The responses of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)) as well as detoxifying enzymes (glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE)) were evaluated at 96 hpf. Similarly, glutathione levels (reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG) glutathione), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) and anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related enzymes were assayed. At 120 hpf, larvae from each group were used for behaviour analysis. Results from this study showed concentration dependent teratogenic effects, particularly by increasing the number of malformations (yolk and eye), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration. However, it was found that the lowest concentration induced a high generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased activity of SOD, GST, and CarE. In addition, GR and GSSG levels were decreased by the lowest concentration, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative stress, which is also supported by the increased AChE activity and absence of behavioural changes. These findings advance the knowledge of the azoxystrobin developmental and environmental impacts, which may impose ecotoxicological risks to non-target species.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.111920","",NA,NA

Seven days of phoxim exposure significantly changed the composition of aquatic microbial community, obliterated the interactions between microorganisms, and thus reduced the complexity and stability of the microbial community. During long-time exposure (i.e., 14 days), most of the ecological functions were restored due to the redundancy of the microbial community. However, phoxim exposure promoted the dissemination of elfamycin resistance gene. The zebrafish gut microbial community also recovered from a temporary ecological disorder of aquatic microbiota, but phoxim continually affected zebrafish growth and swimming behavior. Overall, our results demonstrated that phoxim exposure significantly changed the structure and function of the microbial community and displayed a negative impact on freshwater ecosystems in a short exposure time.","","10.1007/s11356-022-20325-8","",NA,NA

We previously demonstrated that the organophosphorus pesticide (OP) chlorpyrifos (CPF) inhibits axonal growth in cultured neurons. In this study, we used a zebrafish model to determine whether CPF, its oxon metabolite (CPFO), or the excreted metabolite trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) alter spatiotemporal patterns of axonal growth in vivo. Static waterborne exposure to CPFO, but not CPF or TCPy, at concentrations >= 0.03 mu M from 24- to 72-h post fertilization significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase, and high-performance liquid chromatography detected significantly more TCPy in zebrafish exposed to 0.1 mu M CPFO versus 1.0 mu M CPF. These data suggest that zebrafish lack the metabolic enzymes to activate CPF during these early developmental stages. Consistent with this, CPFO, but not CPF, significantly inhibited axonal growth of sensory neurons, primary motoneurons, and secondary motoneurons at concentrations >= 0.1 mu M. Secondary motoneurons were the most sensitive to axonal growth inhibition by CPFO, which was observed at concentrations that did not cause mortality, gross developmental defects, or aberrant somatic muscle differentiation. CPFO effects on axonal growth correlated with adverse effects on touch-induced swimming behavior, suggesting the functional relevance of these structural changes. These data suggest that altered patterns of neuronal connectivity contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity of CPF and demonstrate the relevance of zebrafish as a model for studying OP developmental neurotoxicity.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfr028","Axons",NA,NA

The aqueous extracts presented higher content of total phenols, compared to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, and also demonstrated lower cytotoxicity, which is the basis for testing were carried out only using aqueous extracts. The main phenolic acids found in traditional aqueous (TA) extract were chlorogenic, gallic and protocatechuic acids. Gallic and hydroxybenzoic acids were detected in aqueous cultivated organic (OA) extract. Pretreatment with OA extract (100 mu g/ml, 1 hr) was cytoprotective against rotenone-induced toxicity (1 mu M). For in vivo toxicity assay, zebrafish embryos were exposed to OA or TA extracts (10-160 mu g/ml) at 4 hr post fertilization. TA extract decreased embryos survival in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced the hatching rate at 40 mu g/ml, increased edema frequency at 80 mu g/ml and altered body curvature at 120 mu g/ml. Further, TA extract produced locomotor disorders at concentrations equal to or greater than 10 mu g/ml.

This study aimed to develop larval zebrafish as a high-throughput model for evaluating novel therapeutics against acute organophosphorus exposure. Larval zebrafish at six days post-fertilization were exposed to acute concentrations of seven organophosphorus compounds and treated with one of three oximes. Lethality studies indicated similar relative toxicity to that seen in the established rodent model, with chemical warfare agents proving more lethal than organophosphorus pesticides. Additionally, the organophosphorus-specific response for oxime reactivation of acetylcholinesterase was comparable to what has been previously reported. Behavioral studies measuring the visual motor response demonstrated greater efficacy for centrally acting oxime compounds than for those that are contained to the peripheral tissue.

Analysis was based on targeted detection of 41 pharmaceuticals, and non-targeted analysis (suspect screening) of CEGs. Biological effects of treated WWTP effluents were assessed using a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) swimming behavior assay. Concentrations of residues in surface waters were determined in grab samples and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS).

Eight targeted pharmaceuticals were detected in 100\% of effluent samples with median detections of: bupropion (194 ng/L), carbamazepine (91 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (190 ng/L), citalopram (172 ng/L), desvenlafaxine (667 ng/L), iopamidol (3790 ng/L), primidone (86 ng/L), and venlafaxine (231 ng/L).

In the present study, the toxico-logical effects of TDCPP and TBOEP on human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and their associated mechanisms were investigated at the cellular, organelle and transcriptional levels. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay results showed that TDCPP and TBOEP reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. High-content screening assays showed that both PFRs caused mitochondrial impairment at the organelle level, decreasing the mitochondrial mem-brane potential and increasing the mitochondrial mass, and leading to increased cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage that decreased the ratio of cells in S phase and increased the DNA content. In addition, oxidative stress was identified as a possible initial mechanistic process underlying PFR-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial im-pairment, as evidenced by intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide overproduction from environmentally relevant concentrations. Furthermore, p53 activation was shown to be involved in regulating DNA damage after A549 cell exposure to TDCPP and TBOEP. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that TDCPP and TBOEP triggered p53/p21-mediated cell cycle arrest pathways, indicating that these PFRs can activate p53, and promote as-sociated functional repair. However, the p53/bax-mediated apoptosis pathway was not activated following exposure to PFRs at specific concentrations.

Conclusively, boscalid exposure may affect the neurobehavioral response of zebrafish by impairing proper visual and nervous system function.","","10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124083","",NA,NA

In coral reef-fishes, the movement of larvae from planktonic to reef environments (recruitment) represents a major life-history transition. This transition requires larvae to rapidly identify and respond to sensory cues to select a suitable habitat that facilitates survival and growth. This `recruitment' is critical for population persistence and resilience. In aquarium experiments, larval Acanthurus triostegus preferentially used their right-eye to investigate a variety of visual stimuli. Despite this, when held in in situ cages with predators, those larvae that previously favored their left-eye exhibited higher survival. These results support the ``brain's righthemisphere{''} theory, which predicts that the right-eye (i.e. left-hemisphere) is used to categorize stimuli while the left-eye (i.e. right-hemisphere) is used to inspect novel items and initiate rapid behavioral-responses. While these experiments confirm that being highly lateralized is ecologically advantageous, exposure to chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often inadvertently added to coral-reef waters, impaired visual-lateralization. This suggests that chemical pollutants could impair the brain function of larval fishes during a critical life-history transition, potentially impacting recruitment success.","","10.1038/s41598-017-09381-0","Pesticides;Vision Disorders",NA,NA

In earlier work zebrafish were used as a complementary model to study mechanisms of CPF-induced neurotoxicity induced during early development. We found that developmental (first five days after fertilization) chlorpyrifos exposure significantly impaired learning in zebrafish. However, this testing was time and labor intensive. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that persisting effects of developmental chlorpyrifos could be detected with a brief automated assessment of startle response and that this behavioral index could be used to help determine the neurobehavioral mechanisms for persisting CPF effects. The swimming activity of adult zebrafish was assessed by a computerized video-tracking device after a sudden tap to the test arena. Ten consecutive trials (1/min) were run to determine startle response and its habituation. Additionally, habituation recovery trials were run at 8, 32 and 128 min after the end of the initial trial set. CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.025) greater overall startle response during the 10-trial session compared to controls (group sizes: Control N = 40, CPF N = 24). During the initial recovery period (8 min) CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.01) greater startle response compared to controls. To elucidate the contributions of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to developmental CPF-mediated effects, the effects of developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure throughout the first five days after fertilization were determined. Developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure significantly increased startle response, though nicotine (group sizes: Control N 32, 15 mM N = 12, 25 mM N = 20) was much more potent than pilocarpine (group sizes: Control N = 20,100 mu M N = 16,100 mu M N = 12). Neither was as potent as CPF for developmental exposure increasing startle response in adulthood. Lastly. developmental CPF exposure decreased dopamine and serotonin levels and increased transmitter turnover in developing zebrafish larvae (N = 4 batches of 50 embryos/treatment). Only the decline in dopamine concentrations persisted into adulthood (group sizes: Control N = 14, CPF N = 13). This study shows that a quick automated test of startle can detect persisting neurobehavioral impairments caused by developmental exposure to CPF This may be helpful in screening for persisting neurobehavioral defects from a variety of toxicants.

Considering that neuroactive chemicals are a group of contaminants that dominate the environment, it is then imperative to understand the combined effects of mixtures. The commonly used models to predict mixture effects, namely concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), are thought to be suitable for mixtures of similarly or dissimilarly acting components, respectively. For mixture toxicity prediction, one important challenge is to clarify whether to group neuroactive substances based on similar mechanisms of action, e.g., same molecular target or rather similar toxicological response, e.g., hyper- or hypoactivity (effect direction). We addressed this by using the spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of zebrafish embryos, which represents the earliest observable motor activity in the developing neural network, as a model to elucidate the link between the mechanism of action and toxicological response. Our objective was to answer the following two questions: (1) Can the mixture models CA or IA be used to predict combined effects for neuroactive chemical mixtures when the components share a similar mode of action (i.e., hyper- or hypoactivity) but show different mechanism of action? (2) Will a mixture of chemicals where the components show opposing effect directions result in an antagonistic combined effect? Results indicate that mixture toxicity of chemicals such as propafenone and abamectin as well as chlorpyrifos and hexaconazole that are known to show different mechanisms of action but similar effect directions were predictable using CA and IA models. This could be interpreted with the convergence of effects on the neural level leading to either a collective activation or inhibition of synapses. We also found antagonistic effects for mixtures containing substances with opposing effect direction. Finally, we discuss how the STC may be used to amend risk assessment.","","10.3390/toxics9050104","",NA,NA

The results showed that high concentration of PCM could cause the pericardial edema and increase the heart rates in larval zebrafish, suggesting that PCM had developmental toxicity to zebrafish. We also observed that PCM exposure not only changed the physiological parameters including TBA, GLU and pyruvic acid, but also changed the transcriptional levels of glycolipid metabolism related genes. In addition, after transcriptomics analysis, a total of 1065 differentially expressed genes, including 456 up-regulated genes and 609 down-regulated genes, changed significantly in 100 mu g/L PCM treated larval zebrafish. Interestingly, after GO (Gene Ontology) analysis, the different expression genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched to the three different biology processes including GABA-nervous, lipid Metabolism and response to drug. We also observed that the levels of GABA receptor related genes including gabrg2, gabbr1 alpha, gabbr1 and gabra6 alpha were inhibited by PCM exposure. Interestingly, the swimming distance of larval zebrafish had the tendency to decrease after PCM exposure, indicating that the nervous system was affected by PCM.

The embryo assay was done following the OECD guideline 236 and using a concentration range between 1.1 and 1.8 mg/L. Lethal and developmental endpoints such as hatching, edemas, malformations, heart beat rate, body growth and delays were assessed in a 96 h exposure. A sub-teratogenic range (from 0.16 to 500 mu g/L) was then used to assess effects at biochemical and behavioural levels. Biochemical markers included cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) and were assessed at 96 h. The locomotor behaviour was assessed using an automated video tracking system at 120 h. Carbendazim (96 h-LC50 of 1.75 mg/L) elicited several developmental anomalies in zebrafish embryos with EC50 values ranging from 0.85 to 1.6 mg/L.

Recent efforts have focused on designing high-throughput biological platforms with nonmammalian models to evaluate and prioritize chemicals with limited hazard information. To complement these efforts, this study used a new morphological and behavioral testing platform with embryonic zebrafish to characterize the developmental toxicity of 44 halogenated and organophosphate flame retardants, including several of their known metabolites. Zebrafish were exposed to flame retardants from 6 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf) across concentrations spanning 4 orders of magnitude (eg, 6.4 nM to 64 A mu M). Flame retardant effects on survival and development were evaluated at 24 and 120 hpf, and neurobehavioral changes were measured using 2 photomotor response (PMR) assays. Compared to controls, 93\% (41/44) of flame retardants studied elicited adverse effects among one or more of the bioassays and concentrations tested with the aryl phosphate ester (APE)-based mono-isopropylated triaryl phosphate and the brominated-bisphenol-A analog tetrabromobisphenol-A producing the greatest array of malformations. Hierarchical clustering showed that APE flame retardants with isopropyl, butyl, and cresyl substituents on phenyl rings clustered tightly and were particularly potent. Both PMR assays were highly predictive of morphological defects supporting their use as nonlethal means of evaluating teratogenicity that could allow for additional evaluations of long-term or delayed effects in older animals.

Furthermore, expressions of genes involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the solvent control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two chemicals compared to the single DOX treatment. Overall, our results suggested that TDCIPP had promotion effect on the progression of liver tumor in kras males.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110220","Liver",NA,NA

In this study, zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L clethodim for up to 24 hpf, and zebrafish larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to the same density gradient for 24 h. Our results showed that clethodim could cause head and cardiovascular malformations in embryos: blurred brain ventricles, unapparent brain regions, condensation of nucleus and cytoplasm in brain cells, increased intercellular space, developmental malformations of eyes and ears, reduced neonatal neurons, disorder migration of neural ridge cells; morphological aberrations of the vascular ICM, slowing of heart beat and blood flow, reduction of circulating red blood cells, and delayed development of head and tail blood vessels. These defects could be a result of clethodim-induced oxidative stress and decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which in turn affected the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, decreased ATPase activity, and ultimately led to developmental malformations. The swimming behaviour of zebrafish larvae was observed to decrease with increasing concentration of clethodim exposure, but the angular velocity and mobility increased. These could be due to reduced AChE activity and disturbed gene expression of GABA, dopamine and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems, which thus altered the locomotor behaviour. In summary, we found that clethodim induces developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and larvae. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

But the understanding of potential damage of diuron on reproduction in marine fish is currently not enough. Herein, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) were continuously exposed to 0, 5, 50, 500, and 5000 ng/L diuron from embryo (0 dpf) to adult (180 dpf) stage. The results suggested that diuron had an adverse influence on male reproduction for marine medaka, including decreased gonado somatic index, histological changes of testes, decreased mobility of sperm, and reduced fecundity through disrupting the balance of sex hormone and genes expression related to hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadalliver (HPGL) axis. The reduced fecundity was reflected in abnormal sexual behaviors, further inhibited growth and development of F1 embryo and larvae. Moreover, the proportion of diuron metabolites (DCPMU and DCPU) was increased in fish, but the proportion of diuron was decreased with the increasing of exposure concentration. Diuron, DCPMU, and DCPU was identified as aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist (AhR) agonist using in silico and in vivo models. DCPMU and DCPU induced the gene expression of AhR signaling and metabolizing enzymes (such as cyp1a1) in the livers. A great deal of major metabolites affected various organs related to HPGL axis of male marine medaka and led to serious reproductive disorders. Consequently, it reveals that long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron and even AhR agonist pesticides pose a potential ecological risk for marine fish.","","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135388","Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon;Hydrocarbons;Military Personnel",NA,NA

L.","","","",NA,"Many natural and synthetic compounds present in the environment exert a number of adverse effects on the exposed organisms, leading to endocrine disruption, for which they were termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A decrease in reproduction success is one of the most well-documented signs of endocrine disruption in fish. Estrogens are steroid hormones involved in the control of important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation, maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance of estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final step of estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the cyp19 gene, converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase CYP19 expression and function can dramatically alter the rate of estrogen production, disturbing the local and systemic levels of estrogens. In the present review, the current progress in CYP19 characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the potential of several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and activity is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both aromatase CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and regulation of the reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in diverse teleost species. Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or activity, be it upregulation or downregulation, may lead to diverse disturbances of the above mentioned processes. Prediction of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements in the promoters of teleost cyp19 genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes to affect cyp19 expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein site, an estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive elements, and elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor). Certain compounds including phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may modulate aromatase CYP19 activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown in this review, diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of aromatase cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a contaminated environment to teleost fish population.

It has been reported that dithiocarbamates, including thiuram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), cause wavy distortions of the notochord in zebrafish and other fish embryos. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the toxicity of thiuram in zebrafish embryos. When embryos were exposed to thiuram (2-1000 nM: 0.48-240 mu g/L) from 3 h post fertilization (hpf) (30\% epiboly) until 24 hpf (Prim-5), all embryos develop wavy notochords, disorganized somites, and have shortened yolk sac extensions. The thiurarn response was specific and did not cause growth retardation or mortality at 24 hpf. The thiuram-dependent responses showed the same concentration dependence with a waterborne EC50 values of approximately 7 nM. Morphometric measurements revealed that thiuram does not affect the rate of notochord lengthening. However, the rate of overall body lengthening was significantly reduced in thiuram-ex posed animals. Other dithiocarbamates, such as ziram, caused similar malformations to thiuram. While expression of genes involved in sornitogenesis was not affected, the levels of notochord-specific transcripts were altered after the onset of malformations. Distortion of the notochord started precisely at 18 hpf, which is concomitant with onset of spontaneous rhythmic trunk contractions. Abolishment of spontaneous contractions using tricaine, a-bungarotoxin, and a paralytic mutant sofa potato, resulted in normal notochord morphology in the presence of thiuram. These results indicate that muscle activity is necessary to reveal the underlying functional deficit and suggest that the developmental target of dithiocarbamates impairs trunk plasticity through an unknown mechanism.

To further investigate mechanisms of toxicity of fluridone and to assess its toxicity to early life stages of fish, we performed additional exposures using the fish model Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes). Male and female Medaka embryos were exposed to concentrations of fluridone for 14 d and showed reduced hatching success in a dose dependent manner. The half maximal effective concentration for the hatching success was 2.3 mg L-1. In addition, male and female Medaka larvae were acute exposed to fluridone for 6 h to assess their swimming behavior and gene expression patterns. Fish exposed to fluridone at 4.2 mg L-1 or higher became lethargic and showed abnormal swimming behavior. The response to the stimuli was significantly impaired by fluridone at 21 mg L-1 and above in males, and at 104 mg L-1 in females. Transcriptome analysis identified a total of 799 genes that were significantly differentially expressed, comprising 555 up-regulated and 244 down-regulated genes in males exposed to 21 mg L-1 of fluridone. The gene set enrichment analysis indicated a number of biological processes altered by fluridone. Among the genes involved in those biological processes, the expression of the genes, acetylcholinesterase, retinoic acid receptor, insulin receptor substrate, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S transferase, exhibited dose- and sex-dependent responses to fluridone.

Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under the lysozyme C promoter.

These aquatic species are the fauna widely exposed to environmental changes and chemical accumulation in bodies of water. Neonicotinoids are insecticides that target the nicotinic type acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous systems (CNS) and are considered selective neurotoxins for insects. However, studies on their physiologic impacts and interactions with non-target species are limited. In researches dedicated to exploring physiologic and toxic outcomes of neonicotinoids, studies relating to the effects on vertebrate species represent a minority case compared to invertebrate species. For aquatic species, the known effects of neonicotinoids are described in the level of organismal, behavioral, genetic and physiologic toxicities. Toxicological studies were reported based on the environment of bodies of water, temperature, salinity and several other factors. There exists a knowledge gap on the relationship between toxicity outcomes to regulatory risk valuation. It has been a general observation among studies that neonicotinoid insecticides demonstrate significant toxicity to an extensive variety of invertebrates. Comprehensive analysis of data points to a generalization that field-realistic and laboratory exposures could result in different or non-comparable results in some cases. Aquatic invertebrates perform important roles in balancing a healthy ecosystem, thus rapid screening strategies are necessary to verify physiologic and toxicological impacts. So far, much of the studies describing field tests on non-target species are inadequate and in many cases, obsolete. Considering the current literature, this review addresses important information gaps relating to the impacts of neonicotinoids on the environment and spring forward policies, avoiding adverse biological and ecological effects on a range of non-target aquatic species which might further impair the whole of the aquatic ecological web.","","10.3390/ijms22179591","Animal Shells;Animals;Insecticides",NA,NA

The insecticide synergist PBO is listed among the top 10 chemicals detected in indoor dust; a systematic assessment of risks from PBO exposure, as for many toxicants unfortunately, may be underdeveloped when important biological targets that can cause toxicity are unknown. Hedgehog/Smoothened signaling is critical in neurological development. This study was designed to use novel high-throughput in vitro drug screening technology to identify modulators of Hedgehog signaling in environmental chemicals to assist the assessment of their potential risks. A directed library of 1408 environmental toxicants was screened for Hedgehog/Smoothened antagonist activity using a high-content assay that evaluated the interaction between Smoothened and beta arrestin2 green fluorescent protein. PBO was identified as a Hedgehog/Smoothened antagonist capable of inhibiting Hedgehog signaling. We found that PBO bound Smoothened and blocked Smoothened overexpression induced Gli-luciferase reporter activity but had no effect on Gli-1 downstream transcriptional factor induced Gli activity. PBO inhibited Sonic Hedgehog ligand induced Gli signaling and mouse cerebellar granular precursor cell proliferation. Moreover, PBO disrupted zebrafish development. Our findings demonstrate the value of high-throughput target-based screening strategies that can successfully evaluate large numbers of environmental toxicants and identify key targets and unknown biological activity that is helpful in properly assessing potential risks.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfs165","Insecticides",NA,NA

To evaluate the impact of available DNT studies on individual chemical risk assessments, the ways in which data from these studies are being used in pesticide risk assessment were investigated. In addition, the neurobehavioral and neuropathological parameters affected at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for each study were evaluated to ascertain whether some types of endpoints were consistently more sensitive than others. As of December 2008, final OPP reviews of DNT studies for 72 pesticide chemicals were available; elimination of studies with major deficiencies resulted in a total of 69 that were included in this analysis. Of those studies, 15 had been used to determine the point of departure for one or more risk assessment scenarios, and an additional 13 were determined to have the potential for use as a point of departure for future risk assessments (selection is dependent upon review of the entire database available at the time of reassessment). Analysis of parameters affected at the study LOAELs indicated that no single parameter was consistently more sensitive than another. Early assessment time points (e.g., postnatal day (PND) 11/21) tended to be more sensitive than later time points (e.g., PND 60).

In the present study, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg of TPHP were orally administered to mice from postnatal day 10 (P10) to P70. The behavioral tests showed a compromised learning and memory capability. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus exposed to 0.5 or 50 mg/kg of TPHP identified 531 differentially expressed proteins that were mainly involved in axon guidance, synaptic function, neurotransmitter transport, exocytosis, and energy metabolism. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that exposure to TPHP reduced the protein levels of TUBB3 and SYP in the synapses of hippocampal neurons. TPHP exposure also downregulated the gene expression of neurotransmitter receptors including Grins, Htr1 alpha, and Adra1 alpha in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, the calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis governed by synaptic vesicle proteins STX1A and SYT1 was inhibited in the TPHP-treated hippocampus.

As crucial biomarkers of aging, the accumulation of lipofuscin, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) products exemplified by 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (4-HNE) were detected. This product forms as a result of oxidative stress, as confirmed by an N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pharmacological assay. Moreover, a significant increase in reactive oxide species (ROS) production in a dose-dependent manner using a fluorescent probe was observed. For the underlying molecular mechanism of the above aging phenotypes, significantly upregulated transcription of genes related to antioxidant systems, especially a subset of glutathione S-transferase (gst-5, gst-6, gst-9, gst-10, gst-19, gst-24, gst-26, gst-29, gst-33, and gst-38), was found by RNA-Seq and further confirmed by RT-qPCR. The elevated glutathione S-transferase (GST) was attributed to the significant increase in 4-HNE because mutations in gst-5 and gst-24 inhibited the conjugation of GSTs with 4-HNE. Therefore, GST play an indispensable role in the detoxification process of TDCPP exposure and further confirmed LPO accumulation at the molecular mechanism level.

Profiles of differentially expressed proteins were constructed using a shotgun proteomic. With the input of differential proteins, principal component analysis suggested different protein expression profiles for 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses further found that effects of TPhP at 4 mu g/L targeted phagosome and lysosome activity, while 100 mu g/L TPhP mainly affected carbohydrate metabolism, muscular contraction and phagosome. Based on proteomic data, diverse bioassays were employed to ascertain the effects of TPhP on specific proteins and pathways. At gene and protein levels, expressions of critical visual proteins were significantly changed by TPhP exposure, including retinoschisin la, opsins and crystallins, implying the impairment of ocular development and function. TPhP exposure at 100 mu g/L also altered the abundances of diverse muscular proteins and disordered the assembly of muscle fibers. Effects of TPhP on visual development and motor activity may be combined to disturb larval swimming behavior.

We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Fish which ingested > 1.16 pg.day(-1) for 21 days exhibited abnormal behaviors including diarrhea, abnormal swimming, loss of appetite and decreased egg production. After 7-day exposure to P-CTX-1 at a dose of 1.93 pg.day(-1), significant gender-specific differences in reproductive performance and decreased hatching rate of the offspring were observed. Chemical analysis of P-CTX-1 showed that the P-CTX-1 accumulation rates were 24.1 +/- 1.4\% in female fish and 9.9 +/- 0.4\% in male fish, and 0.05 pg.egg(-1) was detected. The results illustrate that dietary exposure to P-CTX-1 affected the reproductive performance and survival of offspring, and caused bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of P-CTX-1 in marine medaka.","","10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110837","Military Personnel",NA,NA

However, the complicated process and high cost limit widespread use in agriculture, so a simpler and more convenient preparation system is urgently needed. Meanwhile, under complex field conditions, the advantageous mechanism of the nanosize effect and sustained release have no quantitative and detailed study. In this study, a reactive emulsifier (OP-10) is used to participate in the interfacial polymerization of the nanoemulsion, and polymer nanocapsules loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin (NCS@LC) are quickly and easily prepared to study the efficacy and synergistic mechanism of foliar pest control. As a result, the nanocapsule is about 150 nm with a stable core-shell structure. The nanoscale state increases the distribution and adhesion of the particles on the leaf surface, which increases the contact efficiency of pesticides under the different physiological stages and behavioral activities of the target organism. The shell structure provides sustained release characteristics and increases the UV resistance by about 2.5 times for pesticides. Compared with microcapsules loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin (CS@LC), NCS@LC not only shows rapid and synergistic insecticidal efficacy but also provides sustained insecticidal efficacy. The mortality of NCS is 3.4 times that of the nanosized emulsion in water (NEW) at the lowest concentration (0.5 mg L-1), and the control efficacy remained 77.3\% after 7 days. Compared with NEW, NCS@LC provides excellent field efficacy, while LC50 for zebrafish is only 0.68 times without increasing the aquatic toxicity risk.","","10.1039/d1nr04381a","Insecticides",NA,NA

Even if measured concentrations are far below those that cause acute effects, continuous exposure to sub-lethal concentrations may have detrimental effects on the aquatic species present in these remote environments. This may lead to a cascade of indirect effects at higher levels of the ecological hierarchy (i.e., the community). To improve the determination of ecologically relevant risk endpoints, behavioural alterations in organisms due to pollutants are increasingly studied in ecotoxicology. In fact, behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes, and can be very sensitive to environmental stimuli and chemical exposure. This is the first study on behavioural alteration in a wild population of an Alpine species. In the present study, a video tracking system was standardized and subsequently used to identify contaminant-induced behavioural alterations in Diamesa zernyi larvae (Diptera, Chironomidae). Diamesa zernyi larvae, collected in an Italian Alpine stream (Rio Presena, Trentino Region), were acclimated for 24 h and successively exposed to several aquatic contaminants (pesticides: chlorpyrifos, metolachlor, boscalid, captan; pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen, furosemide, trimethoprim) at concentrations corresponding to their Lowest Observed Effect Concentration (LOEC). After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure, changes in the distance moved, the average speed, and the frequency of body bends were taken to reflect contaminant- and time-dependent effects on larval behaviour. In general, metolachlor, captan, and trimethoprim tended to reduce all the endpoints under consideration, whereas chlorpyrifos, boscalid, ibuprofen, and furosemide seemed to increase the distances moved by the larvae. This could be related to the different mechanisms of action of the investigated chemicals. Independently of the contaminant, after 72 h a general slowing down of all the behavioural activities occurred. Finally, we propose a behavioural stress indicator to compare the overall behavioural effects induced by the various contaminants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Various environmental pollutants of distinct physicochemical properties are able to impair the retinal development and function of teleost fishes, including dioxin-like pollutants, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl acids, retinoic acids and metals. Considering the availability of developmental and functional database, zebrafish has been the most frequently used as the teleost model to study aquatic visual toxicology. A diversity of visual deficits has been displayed for fishes across multiple levels of biological organizations (e.g., molecule, cell, histology, physiology and behavior). Covering sensitive developmental windows of eyes during early embryogenesis, acute or chronic exposure to xenobiotics can disturb the expressions of visual gene and protein markers, which affect the retinal neurogenesis and induce degeneration of neurons. Morphological structures and physiological responses of retina and optic rectum are then disorganized, eventually compromising the performance of visually-mediated behaviors and recruitment of individuals. Environmental pollutants can cross the blood-retina barrier and accumulate in eyes, which might impact visual system directly. In addition, pollutants are very likely to interrupt retinal development and function indirectly by disturbing the signaling of retinoids and thyroid. However, exact mechanisms of visual toxicity are largely unknown currently. In this review, the development and structure of retina and available tools for studying visual science are described briefly. Advances in visual toxicology are summarized in detail and outlooks for future visual toxicity studies are discussed.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105542","",NA,NA

In this article, we discuss how we have expanded and automated our screening methodology to allow for fast screening of multiple behavioral endpoints, developmental toxicity, and mortality. Using an 87-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program, consisting of known and suspected neurotoxicants, including drugs, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and presumptive negative controls, we further evaluate the benefits and limitations of the system for medium-throughput screening, focusing on the technical aspects of the system. We show that, in the context of this library, planarians are the most sensitive to pesticides with 16/16 compounds causing toxicity and the least sensitive to PAHs, with only 5/17 causing toxicity. Furthermore, while none of the presumptive negative controls were bioactive in adult planarians, 2/5, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid, were bioactive in regenerating worms. Notably, these compounds were previously reported as developmentally toxic in mammalian studies. Through parallel screening of adults and developing animals, planarians are thus a useful model to detect such developmental-specific effects, which was observed for 13 chemicals in this library. We use the data and experience gained from this screen to propose guidelines for best practices when using planarians for toxicology screens.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfy145","",NA,NA

Such tests are informative, but cannot ascertain effects of long-term and multigenerational mixed-stressor exposure with which organisms are often confronted in their natural environment. Therefore, full lifecycle and multigenerational tests are needed. Yet, these are hampered due to long lifespans and generation times of many standard laboratory species, in particular for vertebrates such as fish. With a typical lifespan of 6 months and a generation time of about 3 months, the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) may be an ideal model for multigenerational testing. In this study, we assessed the impact of full life-cycle exposure to the emerging pollutant fluoxetine (0, 0.5 mu g/L) in combination with chronic exposure during adulthood to the pesticide 3,4-dichlomaniline (0, 50, 100 mu g/L) over two successive generations of N. furzeri. Overall, both life-history and behaviour were affected by exposure to fluoxetine and 3,4-DCA. Inhibitory effects of single chemical exposure on growth and fecundity were generation-dependent, while enhanced swimming acceleration and feeding in response to fluoxetine were dependent on the presence of 3,4-DCA. Together, these findings show the relevance of a multi-stressor approach across successive generations. Although full life-cycle and multigenerational tests are typically assumed to be impractical and costly for fish, we deliver an effective demonstration that such studies are possible within a timespan of less than 6 months with the killifish N. furzeri as a model organism.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105743","Pesticides;Antidepressive Agents",NA,NA

The present study focused on the behavioral and biochemical responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to acute, sublethal exposure to CPF, as well as the persistence of the effects during a 3-week recovery test in CPF-free water. The medaka became hyperactive and exhibited an elevated anxiety state after a 4-day exposure to 0.024 mg/L of CPF, but they recovered from these abnormal behavioral responses within 7 days of recovery treatment. In contrast, persistent impacts on some startle responses to a sudden stimulation (induced by a ball drop) were observed in medaka exposed to CPF. The reaction latency did not change immediately after the 4-day exposure, but was significantly prolonged by as much as 21 days after the termination of exposure. The post-stimulus swimming distance within 5 s significantly decreased on the day immediately after the 4-day exposure, but it significantly increased after 7 days of recovery treatment. The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brains of medaka was significantly inhibited on the day immediately after the 4-day exposure, but it returned to 80\% and 110\% of that in control fish on days 7 and 21 of the recovery period, respectively. However, AChE activities in the eyes of exposed medaka were persistently inhibited and declined to 33\%, 71\%, and 72\% of that in control fish on days 0 (immediately after the 4-day exposure), 7, and 21 of recovery, respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that the changes of AChE activities in the brains of medaka may underlie some of the observed acute behavioral changes, and the changes of AChE activities in the eyes may contribute to the persistence of the abnormalities in the reaction latency of the startle response. Our findings suggest that medaka need a long time to recover from acute, sublethal exposure to CPF, and the persistence of the behavioral abnormalities might affect their fitness in natural habitats.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.09.012","Anxiety;Locomotion",NA,NA

Towards this end, previous work generated a series of modified Gal4 constructs that were up to 20 fold more active than the native gene in An. gambiae cells. To examine the Gal4-UAS system in vivo, transgenic An. gambiae driver lines carrying a modified Gal4 gene under the control of the carboxypeptidase promoter, and responder lines carrying UAS regulated luciferase and eYFP reporter genes have been created. Crossing of the Gal4 and UAS lines resulted in progeny that expressed both reporters in the expected midgut specific pattern. Although there was minor variation in reporter gene activity between the different crosses examined, the tissue specific expression pattern was consistent regardless of the genomic location of the transgene cassettes. The results show that the modified Gal4-UAS system can be used to successfully activate expression of transgenes in a robust and tissue specific manner in Anopheles gambiae.

It is ubiquitous in environmental media, biotic matrixes, and humans, and thus is deemed to be an emerging environmental contaminant. To date, significant levels of TDCPP and its primary diester metabolite, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, have been detected in human samples of seminal plasma, breast milk, blood plasma, placenta, and urine, thereby causing wide concern about the potential human health effects resulting from exposure to this chemical.

Thus, this paper critically reviews the environmental occurrence, exposure, and risks posed by TDCPP to organisms and human health among the literature published in the last decade. It has been demonstrated that TDCPP induces acute-, nerve-, developmental-, reproductive-, hepatic-, nephron-, and endocrine-disrupting toxicity in animals, which has caused increasing concern worldwide. Simultaneously, TDCPP induces cytotoxicity by increasing the formation of reactive oxygen species and inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in multiple human cell lines in vitro, and also causes endocrine-disrupting effects, including reproductive dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes, according to human epidemiology studies.

Reports of disrupted neural growth in vitro, abnormal development in larval zebrafish, and altered thyroid hormones in several species have raised concern for neurodevelopmental toxicity. This is especially the case for TDCIPP, which is more potent and has more activity in those assays than does TCEP.

Corn oil was the vehicle control in both studies. Body weight and righting reflex development were monitored in all pups. A subset of offspring at Culling and weaning, and dams at weaning, were sacrificed for serum and organ collection for measurement of brain, liver, and thyroid weights, serum thyroid levels, and serum and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. Brain weights were also measured in a group of adult TDCIPP-treated offspring. One male and one female from each litter were allocated for behavioral testing at several ages: standard locomotor activity (preweaning, postweaning, adults), locomotor activity including a lighting change mid-way (postweaning, adults), elevated zero maze (postweaning, adults), functional observational battery (FOB; postweaning, adults), and Morris water maze (place learning, reference and working memory; adults). Neither chemical produced changes in maternal body weight or serum thyroid hormones, but relative liver weight was increased at the high doses of both TDCIPP and TCEP. In offspring, there were no effects on viability, litter size, or birth weight. With TDCIPP, absolute liver weights were lower at weaning and weight gain was lower in the high-dose offspring until about two months of age. Thyroid hormones and brain weights were not altered and acetylcholinesterase (both brain and serum) was not inhibited by either chemical. TDCIPP-treated offspring showed slight differences in floating in the water maze, hindlimb grip strength, and altered activity habituation, whereas TCEP-treated rats showed differences in quadrant time (probe) and middle-zone preference in the water maze. Regarding these few changes, the effects were minimal, mostly not related to dose, and did not appear treatment-related or biologically significant Overall, these data do not support the potential for thyrotoxicity or developmental neurotoxicity produced by TDCIPP or TCEP.

In this study, we used our automated planarian screening platform to compare the neurotoxicity of 15 flame retardants (FRs), consisting of representative phased-out brominated (BFRs) and replacement organophosphorus FRs (OPFRs). OPFRs have emerged as a proposed safer alternative to BFRs; however, limited information is available on their health effects. We found 11 of the 15 FRs (3/6 BFRs, 7/8 OPFRs, and Firemaster 550) caused adverse effects in both adult and developing planarians with similar nominal lowest-effect-levels for BFRs and OPFRs. This suggests that replacement OPFRs are comparably neurotoxic to the phased-out compounds. BFRs were primarily systemically toxic, whereas OPFRs, except Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, shared a behavioral phenotype in response to noxious heat at sublethal concentrations, indicating specific neurotoxic effects. We found this behavioral phenotype was correlated with cholinesterase inhibition, thus linking behavioral outcomes to molecular targets. By directly comparing effects on adult and developing planarians, we further found that one BFR (3,3',5,5'-Tetrabromobisphenol A) caused a developmental selective defect. Together, these results demonstrate that our planarian screening platform yields high content data from various behavioral and morphological endpoints, allowing us to distinguish selective neurotoxic effects and effects specific to the developing nervous system. Ten of these 11 bioactive FRs were previously found to be bioactive in other models, including cell culture and alternative animal models (nematodes and zebrafish).

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of iprodione on early embryonic  development and its cardiotoxicity in aquatic animals, using zebrafish as a  model. At 6-72 h post-fertilization (hpf), zebrafish were exposed to  concentrations of 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 25 mg/L (72 h-LC(50) = 21.15 mg/L). We  found that exposure to iprodione resulted in yolk edema, increased mortality, and  shortened body length in zebrafish embryos. In addition, iprodione was also found  to induce edema in the pericardium of zebrafish, decrease heart rate, and cause  the failure of cardiac cyclization. Exposure to iprodione significantly increased  the accumulation of ROS and altered the activity of antioxidant enzymes (MDA,  CAT) in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, iprodione induced changes in the  transcription levels of heart developmental-related genes and apoptosis-related  genes. In addition, Astaxanthin (antioxidant) can partially rescue the toxic  phenotype caused by iprodione. Apoptosis-related genes and heart  developmental-related genes were rescued after astaxanazin treatment. The results  suggest that iprodione induces developmental and cardiac toxicity in zebrafish  embryos, which provides new evidence of the toxicity of iprodione to organisms in  aquatic ecosystems and assessing human health risks.","Place: England","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127860","*Cardiotoxicity;*Zebrafish;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs \& derivatives;Animals;Apoptosis;Cardiotoxicity;Ecosystem;Embryo;Nonmammalian/metabolism;Embryonic Development;Hydantoins;Iprodione;Oxidative Stress;Zebrafish",NA,NA

Yet, one important pharmacokinetic aspect is thus far  only poorly understood in zebrafish embryo and early larvae: their  biotransformation capacity. Especially, biotransformation of electrophilic  compounds is a critical pathway because they easily react with nucleophile  molecules, such as DNA or proteins, potentially inducing adverse health effects.  To combat such adverse effects, conjugation reactions with glutathione and  further processing within the mercapturic acid pathway have evolved. We here  explore the functionality of this pathway in zebrafish early life stages using a  reference substrate (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, CDNB). With this work, we show  that zebrafish embryos can biotransform CDNB to the respective glutathione  conjugate as early as 4 h postfertilization. At all examined life stages, the  glutathione conjugate is further biotransformed to the last metabolite of the  mercapturic acid pathway, the mercapturate, which is slowly excreted. Being able  to biotransform electrophiles within the mercapturic acid pathway shows that  zebrafish early life stages possess the potential to process xenobiotic compounds  through glutathione conjugation and the formation of mercapturates.

Here, we conducted targeted and non-targeted chemical  analyses of sediment and drinking water in CKDu affected regions in Sri Lanka,  one of the most affected countries. Using zebrafish Danio rerio, a toxicology and  kidney disease model, we then examined kidney developmental effects of exposure  to (i) environmentally derived samples from CKDu endemic and non-endemic regions  and (ii) Cd, As, V, Pb, and glyphosate as individual compounds and in mixtures.  We found that drinking water is contaminated with various organic chemicals  including nephrotoxic compounds as well as heavy metals, but at levels considered  safe for drinking. Histological studies and gene expression analyses examining  markers of kidney development (pax2a) and kidney injury (kim1) showed novel metal  and glyphosate-metal mixture specific effects on kidney development.  Mitochondrial dysfunction is directly linked to kidney failure, and examination  of mixture specific mitochondrial toxicity showed altered mitochondrial function  following treatment with environmental samples from endemic regions.  Collectively, we show that metals in drinking water, even at safe levels, can  impede kidney development at an early age, potentiating increased susceptibility  to other agrochemicals such as glyphosate. Drinking water contaminant effects on  mitochondria can further contribute to progression of kidney dysfunction and our  mitochondrial assay may help identify regions at risk of CKDu.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.envint.2020.106019","*Chronic kidney disease (CKD);*Drinking Water/analysis;*Herbicides/toxicity;*Metals;*Mixture toxicity;*Pesticides;*Renal Insufficiency;Chronic/chemically induced;*Unknown etiology;Child;Humans;Kidney/chemistry;Sri Lanka;Kidney Diseases;Kidney",NA,NA

METHODS: In vitro  electrophysiological approaches with recombinant ion channels were used to  highlight functional properties important for classification of drug mechanisms.  We also benchmarked the effects of representative antiepileptic Kv7 activator  drugs using behavioral seizure assays of zebrafish larvae and in vivo Ca(2+)  imaging with the ratiometric Ca(2+) sensor CaMPARI. RESULTS: Drug effects on  channel gating kinetics, and drug sensitivity profiles to diagnostic channel  mutations, were used to highlight properties for categorization of Kv7 activator  drugs into voltage sensor-targeted or pore-targeted subtypes. Quantifying  seizures and ratiometric Ca(2+) imaging in freely swimming zebrafish larvae  demonstrated that while all Kv7 activators tested lead to suppression of neuronal  excitability, pore-targeted activators (like ML213 and retigabine) strongly  suppress seizure behavior, whereas ICA-069673 triggers a seizure-like hypermotile  behavior. SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests criteria to categorize antiepileptic  Kv7 activator drugs based on their underlying mechanism. We also establish the  use of in vivo CaMPARI as a tool for screening effects of anticonvulsant drugs on  neuronal excitability in zebrafish.

As ECG data can accurately reflect the  physiological conditions of organisms, and zebrafish (Danio rerio) are considered  to be good models for cardiovascular research, it is hypothesized that ECG  parameters of zebrafish could indicate the toxicity of water-borne chemicals.

The degradation occurred over a wide  range of temperatures, pH values and pesticide concentrations and followed  first-order kinetics.

In addition, strain Z1 could simultaneously degrade  TAP, MAP, CF and total nitrogen in wastewater in a batch bioreactor, with high  removal efficiencies of 98.3\%, 100\%, 98.7\% and 100\%, respectively. Genomics,  proteomics, qRT-PCR and gene overexpression analyses revealed that the  degradation mechanisms involved the activities of multiple proteins, among which,  organophosphorus hydrolase (Oph) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PaaC) are  primarily responsible for TAP and MAP degradation, while carbofuran hydrolase  (Mcd) and amidohydrolase (RamA) primarily degrade CF.

A zebrafish  model was used in the present study to better define mechanisms of oxidative  stress injury induced by PQ. MAIN METHODS: The toxicity of PQ was evaluated in  the AB strain of zebrafish, and apoptosis was assessed by acridine orange  staining. Macrophage migration was identified using the TG (zlyz:EGFP) transgenic  strain, and angiogenesis was observed using the fli1a-EGFP casper strain.  Following the validation of gene changes by zebrafish-based in vivo quantitative  real-time PCR, network analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway  Analysis software. KEY FINDINGS: We first established the LC50 of PQ in the  zebrafish model, and then found that robust oxidative stress and antioxidant  genes were activated after PQ exposure. Moreover, apoptosis and distinct  macrophage activation and migration were identified for the first time in  PQ-exposed zebrafish. Utilizing this model, both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways  involved in PQ-induced apoptosis were elucidated. We further demonstrated that  macrophage migration was specifically induced by PQ, and that Rho family members  and JNK-MMP13 signaling participated in this process.

We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in  zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of  FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550  exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well  as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied.  In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during  adolescence in zebrafish were studied. METHODS: Developmental exposure to 0,  0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization,  with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute  adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion,  for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank  water with .0004\% (developmental) or .0012\% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior  was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation,  sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration.  RESULTS: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a  significant (p{\textless}0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM  550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior  (p's{\textless}0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were  attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point DISCUSSION: Taken together,  these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations  to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains  and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute  adolescent exposure.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2015.07.001","Animals;Zebrafish;Behavior;Social Behavior;Developmental;Cognition;Acute;Embryonic Development/*drug effects;Animal/*drug effects;Exploratory Behavior/drug effects;Zebrafish/embryology;Escape Reaction/drug effects;FireMaster 550;Flame retardant;Flame Retardants/administration \& dosage/*toxicity;Habituation;Psychophysiologic/drug effects;Organophosphates/administration \& dosage/*toxicity;Polybrominated Biphenyls/administration \& dosage/*toxicity;Reflex;Startle/drug effects;Adolescent",NA,NA

However, there are large  gaps in explaining brain and other developmental malformations on embryonic  PCB-95 exposure. In the present study, we address those deficiencies by studying  the toxic effects of PCB-95 using zebrafish as an ontogenetic model. To  characterize these effects, zebrafish embryos with intact chorions were exposed  to 4 different concentrations of PCB-95 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ppm) for 3  consecutive days. The controls were maintained in 0.5 × E2 medium or egg water  and in 0.1\% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/0.5 × E2 medium or egg water.  PCB-95-treated groups showed dose-dependent decreases in survival and hatching  rates, with increased rates of developmental malformations when compared to  controls. These include morphological malformations, brain cell necrosis, and  smaller eye sizes at 5 d post fertilization. These data suggest potential  mechanisms underlying the abnormal behavior observed in a visual stimulus assay.

To date, little is understood of the  molecular mechanism driving the observed cardiac defects in exposed fishes. The  literature shows PCB \& TCDD derived cardiac defects are concurrent with, but not  caused by, expression of cyp1A, due to activation of the aryl hydrocarbon  receptor (AhR) gene activation pathway. However, in this study, detailed  visualization of fish hearts exposed to PCBs and TCDD show that, in addition to a  failure of cardiac looping in early heart development, the inner endocardial  lining of the heart fails to maintain proper cell adhesion and tissue integrity.  The resulting gap between the endocardium and myocardium in both zebrafish and  Atlantic sturgeon suggested functional faults in endothelial adherens junction  formation. Thus, we explored the molecular mechanism triggering cardiac defects  using immunohistochemistry to identify the location and phosphorylation state of  key regulatory and adhesion molecules. We hypothesized that PCB and TCDD  activates AhR, phosphorylating Src, which then phosphorylates the endothelial  adherens junction protein, VEcadherin. When phosphorylated, VEcadherin dimers,  found in the endocardium and vasculature, separate, reducing tissue integrity. In  zebrafish, treatment with PCB and TCDD contaminants leads to higher  phosphorylation of VEcadherin in cardiac tissue suggesting that these cells have  reduced connectivity. Small molecule inhibition of Src phosphorylation prevents  contaminant stimulated phosphorylation of VEcadherin and rescues both cardiac  function and gross morphology. Atlantic sturgeon hearts show parallels to  contaminant exposed zebrafish cardiac phenotype at the tissue level. These data  suggest that the mechanism for PCB and TCDD action in the heart is, in part,  distinct from the canonical mechanism described in the literature and that  cardiac defects are impacted by this nongenomic mechanism.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105794","Animals;Embryo;Zebrafish;Drug Synergism;Water Pollutants;Chemical/*toxicity;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity;Embryonic Development/drug effects;Nonmammalian/abnormalities/*drug effects/metabolism;Zebrafish/growth \& development/*metabolism;Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR);Atlantic sturgeon;Heart development;Heart/*drug effects/embryology;Myocardium/metabolism;PCB 126;Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/*toxicity;Receptors;Aryl Hydrocarbon/*metabolism;Src;SU6656;TCDD;VE-cadherin/Cadherin 5",NA,NA

Adult zebrafish at  ∼4 months of age were fed a measured amount of feed containing either a solvent  control or one of two doses of dieldrin (measured at 16, and 163.5 ng/g dry  weight) for 4 months. Dieldrin body burden levels in zebrafish after four-month  exposure were 0 (control), 11.47 ± 1.13 ng/g (low dose) and 18.32 ± 1.32 ng/g  (high dose) wet weight [mean ± std]. Extensive histopathology at the whole  organism level revealed that dieldrin exposure did not induce notable tissue  pathology, including the gastrointestinal tract. A repeated measure mixed model  analysis revealed that, while fish gained weight over time, there were no  dieldrin-specific effects on body weight. Fecal content was collected from the  gastrointestinal tract of males and 16S rRNA gene sequencing conducted. Dieldrin  at a measured feed dose of 16 ng/g reduced the abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum  involved in energy resorption. At the level of class, there was a decrease in  abundance of Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, and an increase in  Verrucomicrobiae species. We used a computational approach called predicted  relative metabolomic turnover (PRMT) to predict how a shift in microbial  community composition affects exchange of metabolites. Dieldrin was predicted to  affect metabolic turnover of uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I  [enzyme]-cysteine, hydrogen selenide, selenite, and methyl-selenic acid in the  fish gastrointestinal system. These pathways are related to bacterial heme  biosynthesis and selenium metabolism.

Exposures to nanomolar (nM)  concentrations of bifenthrin have recently been reported to alter calcium  oscillations in rodent neurons. Neuronal calcium oscillations are influenced by  ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity, which modulates calcium-dependent signaling  cascades, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.  RyR activity and mTOR signaling play critical roles in regulating  neurodevelopmental processes. However, whether environmentally relevant levels of  bifenthrin alter RyR or mTOR signaling pathways to influence neurodevelopment has  not been addressed. Therefore, our main objectives in this study were to examine  the transcriptomic responses of genes involved in RyR and mTOR signaling pathways  in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin,  and to assess the potential functional consequences by measuring locomotor  responses to external stimuli. Wildtype zebrafish were exposed for 1, 3 and 5  days to 1, 10 and 50 ng/L bifenthrin, followed by a 14 d recovery period.  Bifenthrin elicited significant concentration-dependent transcriptional responses  in the majority of genes examined in both signaling cascades, and at all time  points examined during the acute exposure period (1, 3, and 5 days post  fertilization; dpf), and at the post recovery assessment time point (19 dpf).

The mainly  target organs of PQ were swim bladder which is the homolog of the mammalian lung,  followed by gastrointestinal tract and liver. Morphological malformations which  were further defined by histopathologic examination include smaller size,  fibrosis and inflammatory cell invasion for swim bladder; irregularly arranged or  dissolved epithelial folds, loss of villous architecture, and ecclasis of mucosal  cells in a smaller lumen for gastrointestinal tract; as well as smaller size,  degeneration, fibrous proliferation, atrophy for liver. In addition, PQ enhanced  leukocyte recruitment (neutrophil migrated first, followed by macrophage) into  swim bladder and induced ROS which can be scavenged by glutathione. Moreover,  qRT-PCR results showed that PQ increased the expression level of genes involved  in the inflammatory response, such as L-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TNF-β, IFN-1,  TGF-β, and NF-kB.

Here, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio)  to describe and compare the developmental effects of warfarin exposure (0, 15.13,  75.68 and 378.43 mM) on two distinct early developmental phases (embryos and  eleuthero-embryos).

To gain insights into the  toxic mechanisms underlying warfarin exposure, the transcriptome of embryos  exposed to warfarin was explored through RNA-Seq and compared to that of control  embryos. 766 differentially expressed (564 up- and 202 down-regulated) genes were  identified.

Concentrations as low as 0.25 µg IVM/L disrupted the swimming behaviour, causing  fish to spend more time at the bottom of aquaria. Such reduction of the swimming  performance affected the feeding ability which is likely responsible for the  weight loss. The effects on weight were gender differentiated, being more  pronounced in males (0.25 µg IVM/L) than in females (25 µg IVM/L). Fish exposed  to 25 µg/L exhibited darker coloration and mild curvature of the spine. No  effects on VTG and AChE were observed, but a reduction on CAT and GST levels was  observed in fish exposed to 25 µg IVM/L, although these alterations probably only  reflect the general condition of the fish which was significantly compromised at  this concentration. Despite that predicted environmental concentrations of IVM  are below 0.25 µg/L, the behavioural effects may be translated into important  ecological impacts, e.g. at predator-prey interactions where fish competitive  advantage can be decreased.

Knockdown of  AHR1B did not affect the toxicity of PAH mixtures or PCB-126, whereas knockdown  of AHR1A exacerbated the cardiac toxicity caused by PAH mixtures and PCB-126.  Knockdown of AHR1A did not impact the mRNA expression of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and  CYP1C1 in exposed embryos, but it did result in increased CYP1 activity in  exposed embryos. As has been shown previously, knockdown of AHR2 resulted in  protection from PAH- and PCB-induced cardiac deformities and prevented CYP1  enzyme activity in exposed embryos. Co-knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 resulted in an  intermediate response compared to knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 individually;  co-knockdown did not exacerbate nor protect from PAH-induced deformities and  embryos exhibited an intermediate CYP1 enzyme activity response. In contrast,  co-knockdown of AHR1A and AHR2 did protect from PCB-126-induced deformities.

RESULTS: Studies included in this review provide ample evidence that  azole compounds are not only commonly detected in the natural environment but  also cause several detrimental effects on fish. Future studies with  environmentally relevant concentrations of azole alone or in combination with  other commonly occurring contaminants in a multigenerational study could provide  a better understanding.

Recent drug repurposing screens have highlighted the broad  bioactivity of niclosamide across diverse mechanisms of action. As a result,  niclosamide is being evaluated for a range of alternative drug-repurposing  applications, including the treatment of cancer, bacterial infections, and Zika  virus. As new applications of niclosamide will require non-oral delivery routes  that may lead to exposure in utero, it is important to understand the mechanism  of niclosamide toxicity during early stages of embryonic development. Previously,  we showed that niclosamide induces a concentration-dependent delay in epiboly  progression in the absence of effects on oxidative phosphorylation - a  well-established target for niclosamide. Therefore, the overall objective of this  study was to further examine the mechanism of niclosamide-induced epiboly delay  during zebrafish embryogenesis. Based on this study, we found that (1)  niclosamide exposure during early zebrafish embryogenesis resulted in a decrease  in yolk sac integrity with a concomitant decrease in the presence of yolk sac  actin networks and increase in cell size; (2) within whole embryos, niclosamide  exposure did not alter non-polar metabolites and lipids, but significantly  altered amino acids specific to aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; (3) niclosamide  significantly altered transcripts related to translation, transcription, and mRNA  processing pathways; and (4) niclosamide did not significantly alter levels of  rRNA and tRNA. Overall, our findings suggest that niclosamide may be causing a  systemic delay in embryonic development by disrupting the translation of  maternally-supplied mRNAs, an effect that may be mediated through disruption of  aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.","","10.1016/j.taap.2019.114699","Humans;Animals;Metabolomics;Cell Line;Zygote;*Zebrafish;Embryonic Development/*drug effects;Embryo;Nonmammalian/*drug effects/metabolism;*Embryonic development;Zebrafish/genetics/*metabolism;Niclosamide/*toxicity;*Maternal-to-zygotic transition;*Niclosamide;Anthelmintics/*toxicity;RNA/metabolism;Yolk Sac/drug effects/metabolism",NA,NA

Early life stage tests with  zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to detect bioactive properties of compounds  released by healthy cyanobacteria (Fischerella ambigua), particularly on the  early developmental stages of fish. This approach, using F. ambigua is probably  most valuable as it shows the toxicity of healthy growing cyanobacteria. The  effects of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites on the embryonic stages of fish  are of considerable interest as many aquatic creatures, particularly fish, are  unable to avoid the potential toxins that may be released by undesirable algal  blooms or as a result of allelopathic effects. In the current study, the  zebrafish (D. rerio) was used as a model experimental system to investigate the  effects of ambigols A and C, tjipanazole D and C, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, cell  free culture media, and media extracts of a terrestrial/fresh water strain of the  cyanobacterium F. ambigua on embryo development.

Our  previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of  MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if  Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the  exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal  concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2,  MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by  real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50\% of control after a 9-h  exposure.

The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be  fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Sp1). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA  binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band  shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in  Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.09.020","Animals;Water Pollutants;Chemical/*toxicity;Protein Binding/drug effects;Down-Regulation/*drug effects;Oxidative Stress/*drug effects;Cadmium/*toxicity;Embryo;Nonmammalian/drug effects;Zebrafish/embryology/*physiology;Antioxidants/pharmacology;DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics;MutS Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA

Thus there is a need for better pharmacological treatments. The human voltage-gated potassium (hKV) channel hKV7.2/7.3 is a validated antiseizure target for compounds that activate this channel. In a previous study we have shown that resin acid derivatives can activate the hKV7.2/7.3 channel. In this study we investigated if these channel activators have the potential to be developed into a new type of antiseizure drug. Thus we examined their structure-activity relationships and the site of action on the hKV7.2/7.3 channel, if they have unwanted cardiac and cardiovascular effects, and their potential antiseizure effect. Methods: Ion channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines and explored with two-electrode voltage-clamp or automated patch-clamp techniques. Unwanted vascular side effects were investigated with isometric tension recordings. Antiseizure activity was studied in an electrophysiological zebrafish-larvae model. Results: Fourteen resin acid derivatives were tested on hKV7.2/7.3. The most efficient channel activators were halogenated and had a permanently negatively charged sulfonyl group. The compounds did not bind to the sites of other hKV7.2/7.3 channel activators, retigabine, or ICA-069673. Instead, they interacted with the most extracellular gating charge of the S4 voltage-sensing helix, and the effects are consistent with an electrostatic mechanism. The compounds altered the voltage dependence of hKV7.4, but in contrast to retigabine, there were no effects on the maximum conductance. Consistent with these data, the compounds had less smooth muscle–relaxing effect than retigabine. The compounds had almost no effect on the voltage dependence of hKV11.1, hNaV1.5, or hCaV1.2, or on the amplitude of hKV11.1. Finally, several resin acid derivatives had clear antiseizure effects in a zebrafish-larvae model.

Zebrafish embryos were  treated with deltamethrin (0.25-0.50 μg/l), at concentrations below the LOAEL,  during the embryonic period [3-72 h postfertilization (hpf)], after which  transferred to fresh water until the larval stage (2-weeks postfertilization).  Deltamethrin exposure resulted in decreased transcript levels of the D1 dopamine  (DA) receptor (drd1) and increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase at 72 hpf. The  reduction in drd1 transcripts persisted to the larval stage and was associated  with decreased D2 dopamine receptor transcripts. Larval fish, exposed  developmentally to deltamethrin, had increased levels of homovanillic acid, a DA  metabolite. Since the DA system is involved in locomotor activity, we measured  the swim activity of larval fish following a transition to darkness.  Developmental exposure to deltamethrin significantly increased larval swim  activity which was attenuated by concomitant knockdown of the DA transporter.  Acute exposure to methylphenidate, a DA transporter inhibitor, increased swim  activity in control larva, while reducing swim activity in larva developmentally  exposed to deltamethrin. Developmental exposure to deltamethrin causes locomotor  deficits in larval zebrafish, which is likely mediated by dopaminergic  dysfunction.

In this chapter, we address important considerations for  using MOs to study developmental toxicology in zebrafish embryos and provide a  protocol for their use.","","10.1007/978-1-61779-867-2_5","Animals;Calibration;Needles;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity;Disease Models;Animal;Zebrafish Proteins/genetics;*Gene Knockdown Techniques;Culture Techniques;Embryonic Development/genetics;Genetic Engineering/instrumentation/methods;Microinjections/instrumentation/methods;Morpholinos/*genetics;Reverse Genetics;Teratogens/toxicity;Toxicity Tests/instrumentation/methods;Zebrafish/*embryology/*genetics;Oligonucleotides",NA,NA

Because a previous study reported that two aryl-OPFRs induced  cardiotoxicity during zebrafish embryogenesis, we designed experiments to compare  the heart developmental toxicity of a series of aryl-OPFRs with alkyl-OPFRs and  explored possible internal mechanism. First, acute toxicity of 9 frequently used  OPFRs were studied with zebrafish embryos (2-96 hpf). By comparing the LC50 and  EC50 (pericardium edema) data, two aryl-OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and  cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) showed greater heart developmental toxicity than  the others. It was also found that the acute toxicity of OPFRs varied mainly  depending on their hydrophobicity.

Five-month-old zebrafish were exposed to metolachlor and  S-metolachlor for 28 days, then transferred to clean water and purified for  7 days. In the uptake phase, S-metolachlor was preferentially accumulated at low  concentrations, while metolachlor was preferentially accumulated at high  concentrations. The two chemicals were metabolized by {\textgreater}70\% in zebrafish on the  first day and showed same metabolic process. At the accumulation endpoint,  S-metolachlor had no significant inhibitory effect on the enzymes activities of  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)  and developmental indicators of zebrafish. However, 300 μg/L metolachlor  significantly inhibited the enzymes activities of SOD, CAT and GST and affected  the liver development. The preferential enrichment of metolachlor at the high  concentration may be the reason for its higher toxicity to zebrafish. Further  research demonstrated that metolachlor significantly altered the expression of  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis-related genes, including gnrh2, gnrh3,  lhβ, 17βhsd and cyp19a, thereby reducing the levels of testosterone (T) in  females and sex hormones (estradiol and testosterone) in males. S-metolachlor  increased the levels of estradiol (E2) in females by altering the expression of  HPG axis-related genes such as fshβ, cyp17, 17βhsd and cyp19a. The mechanism of  metolachlor and S-metolachlor on the endocrine disrupting effects of zebrafish is  different, which may be sex-specific. 7 days after transferring the exposed  zebrafish to clean water, most of the enzymes activities, sex hormone levels and  related gene expression levels returned to normal, which may be related to the  rapid metabolism of the two chemicals.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149826","Male;Animals;Bioaccumulation;Female;Zebrafish;Acetamides;Stereoisomerism;Enantioselectivity;*Water Pollutants;Chemical/toxicity;*Zebrafish;Reproductive toxicity;Metolachlor",NA,NA

However, to assess the commercial potential of this new  bioherbicide, it is necessary to increase knowledge regarding the environmental  behaviour of these toxins, and particularly their effects on non-target  organisms. A negative ecotoxicological profile of this potential bioherbicide  could eventually hinder its registration. RESULTS: In this study, acute and  chronic effects of the A. caulina toxins (ACTs) on non-target organisms were  evaluated in the laboratory. The (96 h) calculated algal Er C50 and NOEC were  142.7 and {\textless}12.5 mg L(-1) respectively. For daphnids, the EC50 (48 h, acute test)  was 20.1 mg L(-1) , whereas the NOEC (21 day chronic reproduction test) was  6.3 µg L(-1) . No cases of mortality, sublethal effects or abnormalities were  observed in the acute and chronic tests for Brachydanio rerio at a concentration  of 100 mg L(-1) , indicating a low toxicity of ACTs for this organism.

The Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test with zebrafish provides a  reliable prediction of acute toxicity in adult fish, but it cannot yet be applied  to predict the occurrence of chronic or delayed toxicity. Identification of  sublethal FET endpoints that can assist in predicting the occurrence of chronic  or delayed toxicity would be advantageous. The present study characterized the  occurrence of delayed toxicity in zebrafish larvae following early exposure to  PCB126, previously described to cause delayed effects in the common sole. The  first aim was to investigate the occurrence and temporal profiles of delayed  toxicity during zebrafish larval development and compare them to those previously  described for sole to evaluate the suitability of zebrafish as a model fish  species for delayed toxicity assessment. The second aim was to examine the  correlation between the sublethal endpoints assessed during embryonal and early  larval development and the delayed effects observed during later larval  development. After exposure to PCB126 (3-3000ng/L) until 5 days post  fertilization (dpf), larvae were reared in clean water until 14 or 28 dpf.  Mortality and sublethal morphological and behavioural endpoints were recorded  daily, and growth was assessed at 28 dpf. Early life exposure to PCB126 caused  delayed mortality (300 ng/L and 3000 ng/L) as well as growth impairment and  delayed development (100 ng/L) during the clean water period. Effects on swim  bladder inflation and cartilaginous tissues within 5 dpf were the most promising  for predicting delayed mortality and sublethal effects, such as decreased  standard length, delayed metamorphosis, reduced inflation of swim bladder and  column malformations. The EC50 value for swim bladder inflation at 5 dpf (169  ng/L) was similar to the LC50 value at 8 dpf (188 and 202 ng/L in two  experiments). Interestingly, the patterns of delayed mortality and delayed  effects on growth and development were similar between sole and zebrafish. This  indicates the comparability of critical developmental stages across divergent  fish species such as a cold water marine flatfish and a tropical freshwater  cyprinid. Additionally, sublethal effects in early embryo-larval stages were  found promising for predicting delayed lethal and sublethal effects of PCB126.  Therefore, the proposed method with zebrafish is expected to provide valuable  information on delayed mortality and delayed sublethal effects of chemicals and  environmental samples that may be extrapolated to other species.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.10.014","Animals;Growth;Toxicity Tests;Zebrafish;Mortality;Lethal Dose 50;Water Pollutants;Chemical/*toxicity;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity;Embryonic Development/*drug effects;Early life stages;Zebrafish/embryology/*physiology;Sublethal effects;PCB126;Air Sacs/drug effects;Delayed effects",NA,NA

The role of α4/α6β2 and the α7 nAChRs in  NIC-induced memory enhancement was evaluated using selective nAChR antagonists.  RESULTS: Low and high doses of NIC, cytisine (CYT), CC4 and CC26 respectively  improved and worsened the mean running time, showing an inverted U dose-response  function. The effective dose (ED50) (×10⁻⁵ mg/kg) was 0.4 for CC4, 4.5 for CYT,  140 for NIC and 200 for CC26. NIC-induced cognitive enhancement was reduced by  the selective nAChR subtype antagonists: methyllycaconitine (MLA) for α7,  α-conotoxin (MII) for α6β2, dihydro-β-erythroidine (DhβE) for α4β2, the  nonselective antagonist mecamylamine (MEC) and the muscarinic antagonist  scopolamine (SCOP), with DhβE being more active than MLA or MII. All the partial  agonists blocked the cognitive enhancement. The improvement with the maximal  active dose of each partial agonist was blocked by low doses of DhβE (0.001  mg/kg) and MII (0.01 mg/kg). MLA reduced the effects of CC26 and CC4 at doses of  0.01 and 1 mg/kg, respectively, but did not antagonize CYT-induced memory  improvement at any of the tested dose.

The  morphological observations revealed that PCP caused a developmental delay of  zebrafish embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptomic data showed  that 50 μg/L PCP treatment resulted in significant changes in gene expression  level, and the genes involved in energy metabolism and cell behavior were  identified based on gene functional enrichment analysis. The energy production of  embryos was influenced by PCP via the activation of glycolysis along with the  inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The results suggested that PCP  acts as an inhibitor of OXPHOS at 8 hpf (hours postfertilization). Consistent  with the activated glycolysis, the cell cycle activity of PCP-treated embryos was  higher than the controls. These characteristics are similar to the Warburg  effect, which occurs in human tumors.

Existing countermeasures are lifesaving,  but do not alleviate all long-term neurological sequelae, making OP poisoning a  public health concern worldwide and the search for fully efficient antidotes an  urgent need. OPs cause irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition,  inducing the so-called cholinergic syndrome characterized by peripheral  manifestations and seizures associated with permanent psychomotor deficits.  Besides immediate neurotoxicity, recent data have also identified  neuroinflammation and microglia activation as two processes that likely play an  important, albeit poorly understood, role in the physiopathology of OP  intoxication and its long-term consequences. To gain insight into the response of  microglia to OP poisoning, we used a previously described model of  diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) intoxication of zebrafish larvae. This model  reproduces almost all the defects seen in poisoned humans and preclinical models,  including AChE inhibition, neuronal epileptiform hyperexcitation, and increased  neuronal death. Here, we investigated in vivo the consequences of acute DFP  exposure on microglia morphology and behaviour, and on the expression of a set of  pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. We also used a genetic method of microglial  ablation to evaluate the role in the OP-induced neuropathology. We first showed  that DFP intoxication rapidly induced deep microglial phenotypic remodelling  resembling that seen in M1-type activated macrophages and characterized by an  amoeboid morphology, reduced branching, and increased mobility. DFP intoxication  also caused massive expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines Il1β,  Tnfα, Il8, and to a lesser extent, immuno-modulatory cytokine Il4, suggesting  complex microglial reprogramming that included neuroinflammatory activities.  Finally, microglia-depleted larvae were instrumental in showing that microglia  were major actors in DFP-induced neuroinflammation and, more importantly, that  OP-induced neuronal hyperactivation was markedly reduced in larvae fully devoid  of microglia. DFP poisoning rapidly triggered massive microglia-mediated  neuroinflammation, probably as a result of DFP-induced neuronal hyperexcitation,  which in turn further exacerbated neuronal activation. Microglia are thus a  relevant therapeutic target, and identifying substances reducing microglial  activation could add efficacy to existing OP antidote cocktails.","","10.3390/ijms23158240","Humans;Animals;Rats;inflammation;microglia;zebrafish;organophosphate poisoning;Antidotes;Sprague-Dawley;Cholinesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism;Brain/metabolism;Zebrafish/metabolism;Organophosphates/metabolism;*Isoflurophate/metabolism/toxicity;*Organophosphate Poisoning/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism;cytokines;Cytokines/metabolism;diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP);microglia in vivo imaging;Microglia/metabolism;Neuroinflammatory Diseases;Microglia;Poisoning;Poisons;Organophosphates",NA,NA

The great demand for thousands  of chemicals yet to be evaluated, urges the development of alternative test  methods which are cheaper, faster and highly predictive for developmental  neurotoxicity. In this study, we developed a new method to assess locomotor  activity in early life stage of zebrafish at 24 h post fertilization (hpf), in  comparison to locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 96 to 192 hpf. We  hypothesized that this endpoint at early life stages could be used to predict the  developmental neurotoxic potential of chemicals and performed exposure studies  with chlorpyrifos to demonstrate this. Furthermore, the case study with  chlorpyrifos was used to critically evaluate behavioral data analysis and improve  method sensitivity. The approach for data analysis using distribution plots for  parameters on locomotor activity, next to mean values allowed to obtain more  accurate information from the same set of behavioral data, both for embryos and  larvae. Embryos exposed to chlorpyrifos, within the range 0.039 to 10 mg/l,  exhibited a significant concentration-dependent increase in the frequency and  total duration of their spontaneous tail coilings at 24-26 hpf. Larvae exhibited  altered swimming activity, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the total  duration of movement and an increase in mean turn angle in the range 0.18 to 0.75  mg/l chlorpyrifos. Methodological evaluation showed that locomotor effects in  larvae were most pronounced and reproducible at 96 hpf, compared to older  individuals (120, 144, 168 and 192 hpf).

In humans, perinatal  exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in  children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that  result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well  understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of  developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life  behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish  embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6,  1.2nM) for 20h (4-24h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in  clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days  post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using  the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several  times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation  were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity  in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126  resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in  adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation.  Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the  brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior,  suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage. Our results demonstrate the  effectiveness of the zebrafish model in detecting subtle and delayed behavioral  effects resulting from developmental exposure to an environmental contaminant.","","10.1016/j.neuro.2015.11.012","Animals;Zebrafish;Anxiety;Habituation;Dioxin;Developmental neurotoxicity;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Brain/metabolism;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity;Larva/drug effects/metabolism;*Zebrafish;Locomotion/drug effects;Behavior;Animal/*drug effects;Psychophysiologic/drug effects;Embryo;Nonmammalian/drug effects/metabolism;PCB126;Receptors;Aryl Hydrocarbon/*agonists;Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon;Hydrocarbons",NA,NA

The high frequency of  exposure to these chemicals raises questions of their potential adverse human  health effects. Additionally, the possibility of exposure to mixtures of these  chemicals is likely due to their co-occurrence; thus, the potential for mixtures  to induce differential bioactivity warrants further investigation. This study  describes a novel approach to broadly evaluate the hazards of personal chemical  exposures by coupling data from personal sampling devices with high-throughput  bioactivity screenings using in vitro and non-mammalian in vivo models. To  account for species and sensitivity differences, screening was conducted using  primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and early life-stage  zebrafish. Mixtures of the G14 and most potent G14 chemicals were created to  assess potential mixture effects. Chemical bioactivity was dependent on the model  system, with five and eleven chemicals deemed bioactive in NHBE and zebrafish,  respectively, supporting the use of a multi-system approach for bioactivity  testing and highlighting sensitivity differences between the models. In both NHBE  and zebrafish, mixture effects were observed when screening mixtures of the most  potent chemicals. Observations of BMC-based mixtures in NHBE (NHBE BMC Mix) and  zebrafish (ZF BMC Mix) suggested antagonistic effects.

Results of  the experiment indicated that cartap concentrations of 100microg/l and above  negatively affected embryo survival and hatching success. Morphological analysis  uncovered a large suite of abnormalities such as less melanin pigmentation, wavy  notochord, crooked trunk, fuzzy somites, neurogenesis defects and vasculature  defects. The most sensitive organ was proved to be the notochord which displayed  defects at concentrations as low as 25microg/l. Both sensitivity towards exposure  and localization of the defect were stage specific. To elucidate mechanisms  concerning notochord, pigmentation, and hatching defects, enzyme assay, RT Q-PCR,  and different exposure strategies were performed.

We then showed that static exposure of embryos to  paraoxon (31.2-500 nM) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and  concentration-dependent AChE inhibition, albeit these effects were fully  reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the  presence of significant AChE inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon  concentrations (≤250 nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron  development at 96 hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of  paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor  behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron  axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of  spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal AChE  expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon  concentrations as low as 31.2 nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal AChE  activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous  tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that  may be independent of AChE inhibition.

The abundance  of the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has been declining  since the 1980s probably due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic  factors. In this paper, we explore the transcriptomic dynamics between  individuals from high (river Tiber, Italy) and low pollution (lake Bolsena,  Italy) environments, which were measured for 36 PCBs, several organochlorine  pesticides and brominated flame retardants and nine metals. RESULTS: To this end,  we first (i) updated the European eel transcriptome using deep sequencing data  with a total of 640,040 reads assembled into 44,896 contigs (Eeelbase release  2.0), and (ii) developed a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression  profiling in the critically endangered European eel of about 15,000 annotated  contigs, which was applied to detect differentially expressed genes between  polluted sites. Several detoxification genes related to metabolism of pollutants  were upregulated in the highly polluted site, including genes that take part in  phase I of the xenobiotic metabolism (CYP3A), phase II  (glutathione-S-transferase) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase). In  addition, key genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative  phosphorylation were down-regulated at the Tiber site relative to the Bolsena  site. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the induced high expression of detoxification  genes, the suggested lowered expression of genes supposedly involved in  metabolism suggests that pollution may also be associated with decreased  respiratory and energy production.","","10.1186/1471-2164-13-507","Animals;Transcriptome;Gene Expression Profiling;Amino Acid Sequence;Environmental Pollution;Italy;Molecular Sequence Data;Endangered Species;Pesticides/*toxicity;Water Pollutants;Chemical/*toxicity;Gene Expression/*drug effects;Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics/metabolism;Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects;Zebrafish/genetics;Flame Retardants/*toxicity;Eels/*genetics;Electron Transport/genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics/metabolism;Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Gene Expression",NA,NA

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether  TDCIPP-induced effects on cytosine methylation persist beyond 6 hpf. First, we  exposed embryos to vehicle or TDCIPP from 0.75 hpf to 6, 24, or 48 hpf, and then  conducted bisulfite amplicon sequencing of a target locus (lmo7b) using genomic  DNA derived from whole embryos. Within both vehicle- and TDCIPP-treated embryos,  CpG methylation was similar at 6 hpf and CHG/CHH methylation were similar at 24  and 48 hpf (relative to 6 hpf). However, relative to 6 hpf within the same  treatment, CpG methylation was lower within vehicle-treated embryos at 48 hpf and  TDCIPP-treated embryos at 24 and 48 hpf - an effect that was driven by  acceleration of CpG hypomethylation. Similar to our previous findings with DNA  methyltransferase, we found that, even at high μM concentrations, TDCIPP had no  effect on zebrafish and human thymine DNA glycosylase activity (a key enzyme that  decreases CpG methylation), suggesting that TDCIPP-induced effects on CpG  methylation are not driven by direct interaction with thymine DNA glycosylase.  Finally, using 5-methylcytosine (5-mC)-specific whole-mount immunochemistry and  automated imaging, we found that exposure to TDCIPP increased 5-mC abundance  within the yolk of blastula-stage embryos, suggesting that TDCIPP may impact  cytosine methylation of maternally loaded mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic  transition.

Co-exposure to MPs and FBPs at both the equi-fugacity and  above-fugacity PCB concentrations had no obvious toxic effects (ROS generation  and cyp1a expression) on zebrafish. When the zebrafish were exposed to the  equi-fugacity PCB concentrations, the PCB concentrations reached 177.7-400.5 ng/g  after a 7-d uptake; the presence of MPs did not significantly enhance PCB  bioaccumulation. The remaining PCB concentrations in the fish after a 4-d  depuration were 58.4-125.1 ng/g; the effects of MPs were the same as those during  the uptake period. However, at the above-fugacity PCB concentrations, the MPs  markedly increased the PCB bioaccumulation (by 1.8-fold) to 712.9 ng/g. This is  because at above-fugacity concentrations, PCBs on MPs migrate to organisms as  there were high fugacity gradients. The FBPs enhanced PCB bioaccumulation in  zebrafish more effectively than the MPs, even after depuration. In the presence  of FBPs, PCB bioaccumulation increased by 2.8- and 4.2- fold after uptake in the  equi-fugacity and above-fugacity scenarios, respectively, both of which were  significantly higher than that observed for the MPs. This is probably because  FBPs are easily assimilated by fish, making the associated PCBs more  bioavailable. Finally, during the co-existence of MPs and FBPs, MPs facilitate  the depuration of PCBs accumulated via FBP vectors; conversely, FBPs did not  affect PCB accumulation via MP vectors. Thus, this study elucidated the effects  of MPs and FBPs on the bioaccumulation of pollutants at equi-fugacity or  above-fugacity concentrations in aquatic environments.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152548","Animals;Bioaccumulation;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Zebrafish;Microplastics;Plastics;*Environmental Pollutants;*Water Pollutants;Chemical/analysis;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Food-borne particles",NA,NA

Here we compared the bioconcentration capacity of two  hydrophobic organic chemicals (i.e., chlorpyrifos and hexachlorobenzene) in a  freshwater fish (Danio rerio) when exposed to chemicals through water only and in  combination with contaminated polyethylene MPs. Additionally, a suite of  biomarker analyses (acetylcholine esterase, glutathione S-transferase, alkaline  phosphatase, catalase) was carried out to test whether MPs can enhance the toxic  stress caused by chemicals. Two 14-day semi-static experiments (one for each  chemical) were carried out with adult fish. Each experiment consisted of (1) a  control treatment (no chemicals, no MPs); (2) a treatment in which fish were  exposed to chlorpyrifos or hexachlorobenzene only through water; (3) a treatment  in which fish were exposed to the chemicals through water and contaminated  polyethylene MPs (100 mg MP/L). Two additional treatments were included for the  biomarker analysis. These contained MPs at two different concentrations (5 and  100 mg MP/L) but no chemicals. The presence of contaminated MPs in contaminated  water did not enhance but rather decreased the bioconcentration of both chemicals  in fish compared to the treatment that contained contaminated water in absence of  MPs. This was more pronounced for hexachlorobenzene, which is more hydrophobic  than chlorpyrifos. Enzyme activity levels in fish were only significantly altered  in the presence of MPs for alkaline phosphatase.

The effects of Gal-1 on DNA breakage, cell damage (release of  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), viability, and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells were  examined by comet assay, LDH assay, WST-1 assay, and flow cytometry,  respectively. Additionally, the regulatory effect of Gal-1 on Nrf2 expression was  examined by western blot. Zebrafish embryos were pretreated with Gal-1 and then  exposed to MPP+. The locomotor ability of zebrafish larvae was then investigated.  RESULTS: MPP+ induced the production of ROS in cells, which can be alleviated by  pretreatment with Gal-1. Gal-1 protected cells from MPP+-induced cytotoxicity by  preventing DNA breakage and cell injury. Gal-1 inhibited apoptosis in SH-SY5Y  cells. The neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 could be abolished when Nrf2  expression knockdown. Moreover, exposure to MPP+ decreased the locomotor activity  of zebrafish, which was attenuated by pretreatment with Gal-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our  study demonstrated that the administration of Gal-1 could protect neurons from  cellular stress by preventing apoptosis and eliminating ROS. Moreover, the  neuroprotective effect of Gal-1 in neuronal cells could be related to the  activation of Nrf2 expression. Therefore, Gal-1 could be a promising strategy for  treating PD.","Place: Italy","10.26355/eurrev_202201_27889","Animals;Oxidative Stress;Cell Survival;Apoptosis;Cell Line;Tumor;Zebrafish/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium/toxicity;*Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology;*Parkinson Disease/drug therapy/genetics;Galectin 1/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology;NF-E2-Related Factor 2/metabolism;Neuroprotective Agents",NA,NA

Therefore, our aims were  to characterize behavioral responses and underlying molecular mechanisms in  zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs and PBDEs as  well as in four unexposed offspring generations. Zebrafish (F0) were chronically  exposed from the first meal onward to a diet spiked with a mixture containing 22  PCB and 7 PBDE congeners in proportions and concentrations reflecting  environmental situations (ΣPCBs = 1991 and ΣPBDEs = 411 ng/g). Four offspring  generations (F1 to F4) were obtained from this F0 and were not further exposed.  Behavior was assessed at both larval and adult stages. Mechanisms related to  behavioral defects (habenula maturation and c-fos transcription) and methylation  (dnmts transcription) were monitored in larvae. Exposed adult F0 as well as F1  and F3 adults displayed no behavioral change while F2 expressed anxiety-like  behavior. Larval behavior was also disrupted, i.e. hyperactive after light to  dark transition in F1 or hypoactive in F2, F3 and F4. Behavioral disruptions may  be related to defect in habenula maturation (observed in F1) and change in c-fos  transcription (observed in F1 and F2). Transcription of the gene encoding DNA  methyltransferase (dnmt3ba) was also modified in all generations.

Over two days of exposure, germ-free  zebrafish larvae were more sensitive to nAg than microbially colonized larvae,  whereas silver ion toxicity did not differ between germ-free and colonized  larvae. Using response addition modeling, we confirmed that the protective effect  of colonizing microbiota against nAg toxicity was particle-specific. Nearly all  mortality among germ-free larvae occurred within the first day of exposure. In  contrast, mortality among colonized larvae increased gradually over both exposure  days. Concurrent with this gradual increase in mortality was a marked reduction  in the numbers of live host-associated microbes, suggesting that bactericidal  effects of nAg on protective microbes resulted in increased mortality among  colonized larvae over time. No difference in sensitivity between germ-free and  colonized larvae was observed for nZnO, which dissolved rapidly in the exposure  medium. At sublethal concentrations, these particles moreover did not exert  detectable bactericidal effects on larvae-associated microbes.

MS-275 or tubastatin alone modulated spontaneous  locomotion. When combined with MPP(+), however, neither MS-275 nor tubastatin  rescued locomotor impairments, although tubastatin did ameliorate the head-reflex  impairment. This study demonstrates the feasibility of pharmacologically  targeting the zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and indicates that their  inhibition can rescue cellular metabolism in a PD model. Absence of improvement  in locomotion, however, suggests that monotherapy with either HDAC1 or HDAC6  inhibitors is unlikely to provide strong benefits in PD. This study highlights  parameters dependent on the integrity of zebrafish neuronal circuits as a  valuable complement to cell-based studies. Also, the demonstrated feasibility of  pharmacologically targeting HDAC1 and HDAC6 in this organism paves the way for  future studies investigating HDAC inhibitors in other diseases modelled in  zebrafish.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.phrs.2015.11.024","Animals;Mitochondria;Zebrafish;Larva;Neurotoxins;1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium;RNA;Messenger/metabolism;Disease Models;Animal;Indoles/*pharmacology;Behavior;Animal/drug effects;Locomotion/drug effects;Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism;Parkinson’s disease;*Parkinson Disease;Secondary/chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology;Benzamides/*pharmacology;Diencephalon/drug effects/metabolism;HDAC inhibitors;Histone Deacetylase 1/*antagonists \& inhibitors/genetics;Histone Deacetylase 6;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Histone Deacetylases/genetics;Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology;MS-275;Oxazines/metabolism;Pyridines/*pharmacology;Tubastatin A;Xanthenes/metabolism;Zebrafish Proteins/*antagonists \& inhibitors/genetics",NA,NA

We recently demonstrated that  developmental exposure of zebrafish to low, nonembryotoxic levels of  3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) did not affect larval behavior, but  caused changes in adult behavior. The objective of this study was to investigate  the underlying molecular basis for adult behavioral phenotypes resulting from  early life exposure to PCB126. We exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 during  early development and measured transcriptional profiles in whole embryos, larvae  and adult male brains using RNA-sequencing. Early life exposure to 0.3 nM PCB126  induced cyp1a transcript levels in 2-dpf embryos, but not in 5-dpf larvae,  suggesting transient activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor with this treatment.  No significant induction of cyp1a was observed in the brains of adults exposed as  embryos to PCB126. However, a total of 2209 and 1628 genes were differentially  expressed in 0.3 and 1.2 nM PCB126-exposed groups, respectively. KEGG pathway  analyses of upregulated genes in the brain suggest enrichment of calcium  signaling, MAPK and notch signaling, and lysine degradation pathways. Calcium is  an important signaling molecule in the brain and altered calcium homeostasis  could affect neurobehavior. The downregulated genes in the brain were enriched  with oxidative phosphorylation and various metabolic pathways, suggesting that  the metabolic capacity of the brain is impaired. Overall, our results suggest  that PCB exposure during sensitive periods of early development alters normal  development of the brain by reprogramming gene expression patterns, which may  result in alterations in adult behavior.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfx192","Animals;Transcriptome;brain;Gene Expression Regulation;Time Factors;zebrafish;Gene Regulatory Networks;Age Factors;Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity;Receptors;Aryl Hydrocarbon/*agonists/genetics/metabolism;Behavior;Animal/drug effects;Zebrafish/embryology;Embryo;Nonmammalian/drug effects/metabolism;Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics/metabolism;Brain/*drug effects/growth \& development/metabolism;Cellular Reprogramming/*drug effects;DOHaD;latent effects;males;RNAseq;Zebrafish Proteins/*agonists/genetics/metabolism;Brain",NA,NA

They offer a powerful way to screen for the potential therapeutic  effects of neuroactive drugs. A variety of behavioral tests for zebrafish have  been developed and validated for assessing neurobehavioral function. The novel  tank diving test is a straightforward, reproducible way of measuring anxiety-like  behavior in zebrafish. When introduced into a novel tank, zebrafish normally dive  to the bottom of the tank and then gradually explore the higher levels of the  water column as time progresses. Buspirone is an effective anxiolytic drug in  humans, which has been found, with acute administration, to reduce this  anxiety-like response in zebrafish. The current study used the zebrafish model to  evaluate the potential anxiolytic effects of alkaloids, commonly found in  Solanaceae plants, with known neuropharmacology relevant to mood regulation. In  line with previous findings, acute treatment with anxiolytic positive controls  buspirone and the plant alkaloid nicotine reduced the anxiety-like diving  response in the zebrafish novel tank diving test. Further, both buspirone and  nicotine continued to produce anxiolytic-like effects in zebrafish after 5 days  of exposure. In the same treatment paradigm, the effects of five other  alkaloids-cotinine, anatabine, anabasine, harmane, and norharmane-were  investigated. Cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, also caused  anxiolytic-like effects, albeit at a dose higher than the effective dose of  nicotine. Nicotine's anxiolytic-like effect was not shared by the other nicotinic  alkaloids, anabasine and anatabine, or by the naturally present monoamine oxidase  inhibitors harmane and norharmane. We conclude that nicotine uniquely induces  anxiolytic-like effects after acute and subchronic treatment in zebrafish. The  zebrafish model with the novel tank diving test could be a useful complement to  rodent models for screening candidate compounds for anxiolytic effects in  nonclinical studies.","Place: United States","10.1016/j.pbb.2021.173223","Humans;Male;Animals;Female;Zebrafish;Disease Models;Animal;Pyridines/pharmacology;*Zebrafish;Behavior;Animal/drug effects;*Anxiety;Nicotine/pharmacology;*Alkaloids;*Nicotine;*Novel tank diving test;Alkaloids/*pharmacology;Anabasine/pharmacology;Anti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacology;Anxiety/*drug therapy/metabolism;Buspirone/pharmacology;Carbolines/pharmacology;Cotinine/pharmacology;Harmine/analogs \& derivatives/pharmacology;Solanaceae/*chemistry;Anxiety",NA,NA

This Ig class is  characterized by its involvement in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs)  for mucosal defence against pathogen infection. Recently, several subclass  members of IgZ/IgT, such as IgZ, IgZ2, Igτ1, Igτ2 and Igτ3, have been further  identified from zebrafish, common carp and rainbow trout. However, the functional  diversity and correlation among these subclasses remain uncertain. Here, we  explored the differential immune reactions of the IgZ and IgZ2 subclasses in  antibacterial immunity in a zebrafish model. IgZ was extensively distributed in  the peripheral serum and skin/gill MALTs and showed a rapid induction upon  bacterial infection. IgZ2 was specialized in skin/gill MALTs and showed a strong  induction following IgZ production. Correspondingly, the IgZ(+) B cells had a  wider distribution in the systemic primary/secondary lymphoid tissues and MALTs  than the IgZ2(+) B cells, which were predominant in MALTs. IgZ and IgZ2 exhibited  a complementary effect in antibacterial immunity by possessing differential  abilities. That is, IgZ is preferentially involved in bactericidal reaction that  is in part C1q-dependent, and IgZ2 participates in neutralization action through  bacteria-coating activity. The production of IgZ largely depended on the αβ  T/CD4(+) T cells, whereas that of IgZ2 did not, suggesting the different  dependencies of IgZ and IgZ2 on systemic immunity. Our findings demonstrate that  the functional behaviour and mechanism of the IgZ/IgT family are more diverse  than previously recognized and thus improve the current knowledge about this  ancient Ig class.","","10.1111/imm.13269","Animals;Zebrafish/*immunology;*antibacterial immunity;*functional diversification;*IgZ/IgT immunoglobulin;*IgZ/IgT subclass;Anti-Bacterial Agents/*immunology;Bacterial Infections/immunology;CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology;Gills/immunology;Immunity;Mucosal/immunology;Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*immunology;Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*immunology;Lymphoid Tissue/immunology;Mucous Membrane/immunology;Oncorhynchus mykiss/immunology;Zebrafish Proteins/*immunology;Immunoglobulin D;Immunoglobulin M;Immunoglobulin Variable Region;Immunoglobulin A;Immunoglobulin E;Immunoglobulin G;Immunoglobulins",NA,NA

Therefore, the present study sought to determine the tolerated in vivo doses of  cytochalasins and jasplakinolide in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a well-studied fish  cancer model that is 1.5\% the size of mice. We also determined the tolerated  levels of a variety of clinically active anti-neoplastic agents in zebrafish for  comparison with tolerated murine doses as a means to allow comparison of  toxicities in zebrafish expressed as μM concentrations with toxicities in mice  expressed in mg/kg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tolerated doses in zebrafish with  various cytochalasins or jasplakinolide were determined by adding the solubilized  test agent to water in which the fish were maintained for 24 h, then restored to  their normal tanks and monitored for a total of 96 h. RESULTS: Cytochalasin D at  0.2 μM gave an approximate LD50 in zebrafish, while cytochalasin B was  fully-tolerated at 5 μM, and gave an LD50 of 10 μM. 21,22-dihydrocytochalasin B  was fully-tolerated at 10 μM. Cytochalasin C was tolerated fully at 1 μM,  ten-fold higher than the level for cytochalasin D that was tolerated.  Jasplakinolide at 0.5 μM did not exhibit any apparent acute toxicity or affect  fish behavior for four days, but delayed toxicity was evident at days 4 and 6  when the fish died. Further, the addition of 5 μM glutathione (GSH) at the time  of treatment substantially decreased the toxicity of 10 μM cytochalasin B, a  level of cytochalasin B that not otherwise tolerated in vivo. Such observations  were likely due to GSH-mediated alkylation of C-20 in cytochalasin B, thereby  reducing the rate of oxidation to the highly toxic congener, cytochalasin A, and  reacting with any cytochalazin A formed. The protective effects of GSH are  further supported by its ability to react with α, β-unsaturated ketone moieties,  as is found in cytochalasin A. GSH at 0.8 uM was able to reduce the toxicity of  0.8 μM cytochalasin D, but it took 20 μM GSH to fully protect against the  toxicity of 0.8 μM cytochalasin D. CONCLUSION: Pre-clinical evaluation of rare  natural products such as microfilamented-directed agents for efficacy in vivo in  tumor-bearing zebrafish is a feasible prospect. Dose-limiting toxicities in  zebrafish expressed as μM concentrations in water can be used to estimate in vivo  toxicities in mice expressed as mg/kg.","Place: Greece","","Animals;toxicity;glutathione;Mice;Zebrafish;zebrafish;Molecular Structure;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Drug Evaluation;Preclinical;Disease Models;Animal;Toxicity Tests;Acute;*Actin Cytoskeleton;21;22-dihydro-Cytochalasin B;Antineoplastic Agents/*administration \& dosage/chemistry/toxicity;chemotherapy;Cytochalasin B;Cytochalasin C;Cytochalasin D;Cytochalasins;Cytochalasins/*administration \& dosage/chemistry/toxicity;Depsipeptides/*administration \& dosage/chemistry/toxicity;Jasplakinolide;microfilament-directed agents;Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology",NA,NA

The two enhancers,  dexamethasone and prednisolone, are synthetic glucocorticoids that potentiated  hair cell numbers during regeneration and also induced hair cell addition in the  absence of damage. BrdU analysis confirmed that the extra hair cells arose from  mitotic activity. We found that dexamethasone and prednisolone, like other  glucocorticoids, suppress zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, indicating that hair  cell regeneration occurs by a distinctly different process. Further analyses of  the regeneration inhibitors revealed that two of the six, flubendazole and  topotecan, significantly suppress hair cell regeneration by preventing  proliferation of hair cell precursors. Flubendazole halted support cell division  in M-phase, possibly by interfering with normal microtubule activity. Topotecan,  a topoisomerase inhibitor, killed both hair cells and proliferating hair cell  precursors. A third inhibitor, fulvestrant, moderately delayed hair cell  regeneration by reducing support cell proliferation. Our observation that hair  cells do not regenerate when support cell proliferation is impeded confirms  previous observations that cell division is the primary route for hair cell  regeneration after neomycin treatment in zebrafish.","","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3905-11.2012","Animals;Zebrafish;Glucocorticoids/pharmacology;Estradiol/analogs \& derivatives/pharmacology;Fulvestrant;Genetically Modified;Cell Death/drug effects/physiology;Hair Cells;Auditory/drug effects/*physiology;Lateral Line System/cytology/drug effects/*physiology;Mebendazole/analogs \& derivatives/pharmacology;Mechanoreceptors/drug effects/physiology;Neomycin/pharmacology;Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/*physiology;Neural Inhibition/drug effects;Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology;Topotecan/pharmacology;Regeneration;Hair",NA,NA

However, they are  usually toxic or ineffective in serum and various strategies to improve their  biocompatibility or nonfouling property have often resulted in compromised  bactericidal activity. Also, star-shaped polymers are less explored than linear  polymers for application as antibacterial compounds. In this paper, star polymers  with poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDMA) as the arms and polyhedral  oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) as the core (POSS-g-PDMA) were successfully  synthesized by ATRP.

POSS-g-PDMA was further  modified by various hydrophilization strategies in attempting to reduce  hemolysis. With quaternization of POSS-g-PDMA, the antibacterial activities of  the obtained quaternary polymers are almost unchanged and the copolymers become  relatively nonhemolytic.

Many EDCs are lipophilic molecules  and bind to hydrophobic pockets in steroid receptors, such as the estrogen  receptor and androgen receptor, which are important in vertebrate reproduction  and development. Indeed, health effects attributed to EDCs include reproductive  dysfunction (e.g. reduced fertility, reproductive tract abnormalities, and skewed  male:female sex ratios in fish), early puberty, various cancers, and obesity. A  major concern is the effects of exposure to low concentrations of endocrine  disruptors in utero and post partum, which may increase the incidence of cancer  and diabetes in adults. EDCs affect transcription of hundreds and even thousands  of genes, which has created the need for new tools to monitor the global effects  of EDCs. The emergence of massive parallel sequencing for investigating gene  transcription provides a sensitive tool for monitoring the effects of EDCs on  humans and other vertebrates, as well as elucidating the mechanism of action of  EDCs. Zebrafish conserve many developmental pathways found in humans, which makes  zebrafish a valuable model system for studying EDCs, especially on early organ  development because their embryos are translucent.

Recent studies have  suggested that SU4312 can also be useful in treating neurodegenerative disorders.  In this study, we assessed neuroprotection by SU4312 against  1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+) )-induced neurotoxicity and further  explored the underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: MPP(+) -treated  neurons and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated zebrafish  were used to study neuroprotection by SU4312. NOS activity was assayed in vitro  to examine direct interactions between SU4312 and NOS isoforms. KEY RESULTS:  SU4312 unexpectedly prevented MPP(+) -induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and  decreased MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, reduced expression of mRNA  for tyrosine hydroxylase and impaired swimming behaviour in zebrafish. In  contrast, PTK787/ZK222584, a well-studied VEGFR-2 inhibitor, failed to prevent  neurotoxicity, suggesting that the neuroprotective actions of SU4312 were  independent of its anti-angiogenic action. Furthermore, SU4312 exhibited  non-competitive inhibition of purified neuronal NOS (nNOS) with an IC(50) value  of 19.0 μM but showed little or no effects on inducible and endothelial NOS.  Molecular docking simulations suggested an interaction between SU4312 and the  haem group within the active centre of nNOS. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION: SU4312  exhibited neuroprotection against MPP(+) at least partly via selective and direct  inhibition of nNOS. Because SU4312 could reach the brain in rats, our study also  offered a support for further development of SU4312 to treat neurodegenerative  disorders, particularly those associated with NO-mediated neurotoxicity.","","10.1111/bph.12004","Humans;Animals;Rats;Zebrafish;Molecular Docking Simulation;Sprague-Dawley;Cell Line;Tumor;PC12 Cells;Brain/metabolism;Behavior;Animal/drug effects;Motor Activity/drug effects;Cell Death/drug effects;1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium/*toxicity;1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1;2;3;6-tetrahydropyridine;Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Embryo;Nonmammalian/anatomy \& histology/drug effects/physiology;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use;Indoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Neurons/drug effects;Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I/*antagonists \& inhibitors;Nitric Oxide/metabolism",NA,NA

Hits were  further characterized and validated using a series of in vitro assays, a  zebrafish model enabling three-dimensional (3D) visualization of tumor cell  extravasation, and mouse models of lung metastasis. The initial screen advanced  38 compounds as potential hits, of which, four compounds enhanced endothelial  barrier stability while concurrently suppressing tumor cell motility. Two  compounds niclosamide and forskolin significantly reduced tumor cell  extravasation in zebrafish, and niclosamide drastically impaired metastasis in  mice. Because niclosamide had not previously been linked with effects on barrier  function, single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered mechanistic effects of the drug on  both tumor and endothelial cells. Importantly, niclosamide affected homotypic and  heterotypic signaling critical to intercellular junctions, cell-matrix  interactions, and cytoskeletal regulation.

Although genetic predisposition and a positive  energy balance are implicated in obesity, these factors alone do not account for  the excess prevalence of obesity in lower socioeconomic populations. Therefore,  environmental factors, including exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and other  contaminants, are agents widely suspected to have obesogenic activity, and they  also are spatially correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Our study  investigates the causal relationship between exposure to the heavy metal, cadmium  (Cd), and obesity in a cohort of children and in a zebrafish model of  adipogenesis. DESIGN: An extensive collection of first trimester maternal blood  samples obtained as part of the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) was analyzed for  the presence of Cd, and these results were cross analyzed with the weight-gain  trajectory of the children through age 5 years. Next, the role of Cd as a  potential obesogen was analyzed in an in vivo zebrafish model. RESULTS: Our  analysis indicates that the presence of Cd in maternal blood during pregnancy is  associated with increased risk of juvenile obesity in the offspring, independent  of other variables, including lead (Pb) and smoking status. Our results are  recapitulated in a zebrafish model, in which exposure to Cd at levels  approximating those observed in the NEST study is associated with increased  adiposity.

PCB126 produced a concentration-dependent induction of pericardial edema and  circulatory failure, and a concentration-dependent reduction of cardiac output  and body length at 80 hours post fertilization (hpf). Among several modulators  tested, the effects of PCB126 could be both positively and negatively modulated  by different compounds; co-treatment with α-tocopherol (vitamin E liposoluble)  prevented the adverse effects of PCB126 in pericardial edema, whereas  co-treatment with sodium nitroprusside (a vasodilator compound) significantly  worsened PCB126 effects. Gene expression analysis showed an up-regulation of  cyp1a, hsp70, and gstp1, indicative of PCB126 interaction with the aryl  hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), while the transcription of antioxidant genes (sod1,  sod2; cat and gpx1a) was not affected.

Although current treatment regimens cure approximately 70\% of patients with  localized disease, they are ineffective for most patients with metastases or  relapse. New treatment combinations are necessary for these patients.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on focal adhesion kinase  (FAK) for growth. To identify candidate treatment combinations for Ewing sarcoma,  we performed a small-molecule library screen to identify compounds synergistic  with FAK inhibitors in impairing Ewing cell growth. The activity of a top-scoring  class of compounds was then validated across multiple Ewing cell lines in vitro  and in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. RESULTS: Numerous Aurora  kinase inhibitors scored as synergistic with FAK inhibition in this screen. We  found that Aurora kinase B inhibitors were synergistic across a larger range of  concentrations than Aurora kinase A inhibitors when combined with FAK inhibitors  in multiple Ewing cell lines. The combination of AZD-1152, an Aurora kinase  B-selective inhibitor, and PF-562271 or VS-4718, FAK-selective inhibitors,  induced apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma cells at concentrations that had minimal  effects on survival when cells were treated with either drug alone.

Next, PSB could decreased apoptosis and death in  the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells, evidenced by  MTT, LDH, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and DNA fragmentation assay. PSB also blocked  MPP(+)-induced apoptotic cascades, including loss of mitochondrial membrane  potential, activation of caspase 3, and reduced ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition,  PSB suppressed MPP(+)-induced oxidative stress but increased antioxidant enzymes,  evidenced by decrease of reactive oxygen species generation and lipid  peroxidation and up-regulation of GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, GSH/GSSG, and NAD/NADH.

Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown via specific Nrf2 siRNA abolished  PSB-induced antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects against MPP(+) insults.

Although the  regulon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are  not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative  stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the  corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing  (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a  knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and  mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to  elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly  regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and  denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes  specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators  were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant  was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration  against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity,  allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels,  was further evaluated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP(+)) accumulation assay.

This paper describes a study that examines the effects of exogenously induced  oxidative stress on K. pneumoniae and uncovers a target that could be useful to  harness as a strategy to mitigate resistance.","","10.1128/mBio.00867-21","Humans;Animals;Gene Expression Profiling;Zebrafish;Transcription;Genetic;Escherichia coli/genetics;Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology;*AMR;*Klebsiella pneumoniae;*mechanisms of resistance;*oxidative stress;*Regulon;*soxS;Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism;Drug Resistance;Multiple;Bacterial/*genetics;Escherichia coli Proteins/genetics;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Complementation Test;Klebsiella Infections/microbiology;Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/*genetics;Oxidative Stress/*genetics;Trans-Activators/genetics",NA,NA

Among the more intriguing and perhaps counterintuitive findings, at the current  state of the art, the connection between RNase activity and characterized host  defense functions is quite weak; whether this is a scientific reality or more a  reflection of what has been chosen for study remains to be determined. Several of  the RNase A family RNases are highly cationic and have cytotoxic and bactericidal  properties that are clearly (eosinophil cationic protein, leukocyte RNase A-2) or  are probably (RNase 7) unrelated to their enzymatic activity. Interestingly,  peptides derived from the leukocyte RNase A-2 sequence are nearly as bactericidal  as the entire protein, suggesting that among other functions, the RNase A  superfamily may be serving as a source of gene scaffolds for the generation of  novel cytotoxic peptides. Other RNase A ribonucleases are somewhat less cationic  (mouse angiogenin 4, zebrafish RNases) and have moderate bactericidal activities  that have not yet been explored mechanistically. Additional host defense  functions characterized specifically for the RNase eosinophil-derived neurotoxin  include reducing infectivity of RNA viruses for target cells in culture, which  does require RNase activity, chemoattraction of immature human dendritic cells  via a G-protein-coupled receptor-dependent mechanism, and activation of TLR2. The  properties of individual RNase A ribonucleases, recent experimental findings, and  important questions for the near and distant future will be reviewed.","","10.1189/jlb.1107725","Animals;Mammals;Chickens;Zebrafish;Cattle;Rana catesbeiana;Eosinophil Cationic Protein/metabolism;Eosinophils/enzymology;Leukocytes/enzymology;Pancreas/enzymology;Ribonuclease;Pancreatic/classification/genetics/*metabolism;Ribonucleases/metabolism;Ribonuclease, Pancreatic;Ribonuclease H;Ribonuclease P;Ribonuclease III;Ribonucleases",NA,NA

Compared with several first-line antibiotics, the obtained nanostructures have a  better inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and stronger  ability for biofilm removal. These qualities are attributed to the fact that  organic assemblies can first spontaneously adhere to the surface of the bacteria,  infiltrate into the cell, and then lead to converging attack against MRSA;  thereafter, multipath bactericidal mechanisms of NPs on MRSA are found by both  transcriptomic analysis and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis.

In addition, TBN improved apomorphine-induced  rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-lesioned PD rats. TBN suppressed the  MPP(+)-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells,  increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH)  concentration in the substantial nigra of MPTP-treated mice.

It is recognized as a new type of environmental  endocrine disruptor with frequent detection and environmental pollution. However,  the toxicity mechanism regarding neurodevelopment and neurobehavior remains  unclear. This study is intended to explore the underlying toxic mechanism of TCS  based on gut-brain axis. TCS-chronic exposure affected the development of  zebrafish, induced feminization, obesity physical signs and abnormal organ index  and caused neurobehavioral abnormalities by inhibiting both neurotransmitter  acetylcholinesterase and dopamine activity, promoting brain neuron apoptosis and  accelerating diencephalic lesions. Meanwhile, TCS-chronic exposure led to gut  microbiota dysbiosis and decreased diversity, such as increased pathogenic  bacteria and decreased probiotics in adult zebrafish gut, which caused many  pathological damages, including partial shedding and ablation of intestinal  villi, inflammatory infiltration, thinning of intestinal wall, and increased  goblet cell in villus. Based on the communication between intestinal peripheral  nerves and CNS, the above histopathological injuries and disorders were well  underpinned and illustrated by the changes of biomarkers and the expression of  related marker genes in the gut-brain axis. Additionally, short-chain fatty acids  (SCFA), as the regulators of intestinal sympathetic nerve activation, are also  secreting products of intestinal microflora and play a crucial role in regulating  the balance of intestinal flora and protecting intestinal homeostasis. SCFA in  low doses can effectively alleviate and rescue the toxic effects under TCS  exposure, which evidenced that TCS exerted systemic toxic effects on the  gut-brain axis by influencing the composition and diversity of gut flora in  zebrafish, and fully demonstrated the interaction effect between intestine and  brain. Hence, these findings contribute to the understanding, prevention, and  diagnosis of endocrine disrupting diseases caused by environmental pollutants  from the perspective of the gut-brain axis, and strengthening the early warning,  management and control of TCS pollution.","Place: Netherlands","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156936","Zebrafish;Triclosan;Gut-brain axis;Intestinal flora imbalance;Neurobehavioral abnormalities;Brain",NA,NA

Turbot and other flatfish are used to characterize the  presence of chemicals in the marine environment. Unfortunately, there are  relatively few genes of turbot and other flatfish in GenBank, which limits the  use of molecular tools such as microarrays and quantitative reverse-transcriptase  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to study disruption of endocrine responses in  sentinel fish captured by regulatory agencies. OBJECTIVES: We fabricated a  multigene cross-species microarray as a diagnostic tool to screen the effects of  environmental chemicals in fish, for which there is minimal genomic information.  The array included genes that are involved in the actions of adrenal and sex  steroids, thyroid hormone, and xenobiotic responses. This microarray will provide  a sensitive tool for screening for the presence of chemicals with adverse effects  on endocrine responses in coastal fish species. METHODS: We used a custom  multispecies microarray to study gene expression in wild hornyhead turbot  (Pleuronichthys verticalis) collected from polluted and clean coastal waters and  in laboratory male zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to estradiol and  4-nonylphenol. We measured gene-specific expression in turbot liver by qRT-PCR  and correlated it to microarray data. RESULTS: Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses of  livers from turbot collected from polluted areas revealed altered gene expression  profiles compared with those from nonaffected areas. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement  between the array data and qRT-PCR analyses validates this multispecies  microarray. The microarray measurement of gene expression in zebrafish, which are  phylogenetically distant from turbot, indicates that this multispecies microarray  will be useful for measuring endocrine responses in other fish.","","10.1289/ehp.11627","Animals;nonylphenol;Danio rerio;flatfish;California;zebrafish;xenobiotics;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity;Gene Expression/*drug effects;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods;endocrine disruptors;Flatfishes/*genetics;hornyhead turbot;microarray;multispecies array;Pleuronichthys verticalis;xenoestrogens",NA,NA

Hundreds  of spills of FPW have been reported to the Alberta Energy Regulator each year.  Recently, samples of FPW derived from hydraulic fracturing of the Duvernay  Formation, AB, were found to contain a previously unidentified class of aryl  phosphates, including diphenyl phosphate (DPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and  others. Aryl phosphates are also used in a variety of other industries and their  constituents can be found in flame retardants, plasticizers, lubricants,  hydraulic fluids, and oxidizers. Many of these aryl phosphates break down into  DPP. Therefore, it is important to determine the environmental fate and potential  impact of DPP if spilled in the near-surface, as DPP is an emerging contaminant  in soil and groundwater systems. This study was aimed at determining 1) the  sorption behavior of DPP onto various surficial sediments collected within the  Fox Creek, AB region, and 2) the toxicity of DPP toward aquatic ecosystems. We  report that the sorption of DPP onto both clay-rich soils and sandy sediment was  low compared to that of other aryl phosphates, with an average log K(OC) value of  2.30 ± 0.42 (1σ). Therefore, the transport of DPP in groundwater would be rapid  due to its low degree of sorption on surficial materials. We also determined the  acute 96 h-LC(50) of DPP on zebrafish embryos to be 50.0 ± 7.1 mg/L. Su et al.

Screening a library of 13 plant nutraceuticals led to the identification of  acetyl shikonin and ursolic acid, which exhibited synergy with colistin against  extremely drug resistant (XDR) clinical strains of E. coli (U3790) and K.  pneumoniae (BC936). Ursolic acid caused a significant colistin MIC reversal of  16-fold in U3790 and 4-fold in BC936 strains. Ursolic acid also potentiated the  bactericidal effect of colistin against both U3790 and BC936 by causing {\textasciitilde} 4 to  4.5 log fold decline in CFU of both clinical isolates in a time kill assay. At 2×  minimum effective concentration, ursolic acid was non-toxic to zebrafish as  evidenced by brain and liver enzyme profiles and by histopathology studies. In  combination with colistin, ursolic acid reduced bacterial bioburden of  U3790/BC936 by 1-1.58 log fold from the infected muscle tissue of zebrafish.  Mechanistic explorations via studies on real time efflux, membrane potential and  intracellular accumulation of dansyl chloride tagged colistin revealed that  colistin efflux is inhibited by ursolic acid. In addition, ursolic acid also  enhanced outer membrane permeability which probably facilitates colistin's attack  on outer and inner membranes.

The acute toxicity of R-PYD was 10.7-14.7-fold than that of S-PYD  against Danio rerio embryos, larvae, and adults. Meanwhile, R-PYD presented a  stronger effect on embryo hatching and abnormalities, adult tissue damage and  oxidative stress.

This study intends to  explore the efficient detoxification of JCC through multi-strain collaborative  fermentation to accelerate the detoxification process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mucor  circinelloides SCYA25 strain that we previously reported can effectively degrade  the toxicity of JCC, and the newly screened Bacillus megaterium SCYA10 and  Geotrichum candidum SCYA23 strains were used to detoxify JCC. Different  solid-state-fermentation (SSF) parameters were optimized by single-factor tests  and response surface methodology. A detoxification rate established by zebrafish  toxicity of JCC at 96\% was achieved under the following optimized conditions: the  combination ratio of B. megaterium SCYA10, G. candidum SCYA23 and M.  circinelloides SCYA25 at 2:3:1, a total injection amount of 15.25\%, a feed to  water ratio of 1:0.68, a fermentation temperature of 30.3°C and fermentation  duration of 21.5 days. The protein content of fermented JCC (FJCC) increased,  while the concentrations of ether extract, crude fibre and toxins were all  degraded considerably. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the fermentation  increased the contents of neurotransmitter receptor modulator, emulsifier,  aromatic substances and insecticidal compounds, as well as decreasing the  contents of oxidative stress and neurotoxic substances. A rat feeding trial  showed that the growth performance of the rats provided with the FJCC diet was  similar to that of the corn-soybean meal group, and no lesions in the liver and  kidney were observed. CONCLUSION: The co-bio-fermentation process can effectively  detoxify JCC and improve its nutritional value, which means it could be served as  a protein feed in animal husbandry.

Then, the in vivo and  in vitro models were applied to comprehensively estimate the embryo toxicity and  potential endocrine effect of chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil. The  data from zebrafish embryo toxicity showed that the lowest observed effect  concentrations of both chlorothalonil and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil were 50 μg/L  after 96 h of exposure. The mortality rate of the 4-hydroxychlorothalonil was  2.6-fold higher than that of the parent compound at the concentration of 50 μg/L.  Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that both chlorothalonil and  4-hydroxychlorothalonil exerted estrogen receptor α (ERα) agonist activity with  REC(20) values of 2.4 × 10(-8) M and 3.6 × 10(-8) M, respectively.

In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 20 and  40 µg/L DM. The changes of swim bladder morphology were observed and  transcription levels of key genes were compared between DM treatments and the  control. The results showed that DM treatments significantly blocked the  formation of progenitor and tissue layers in swim bladder of zebrafish embryos,  leading to failed inflation of swim bladder. Compared with the control, the key  genes (pbx1, foxA3, mnx1, has2, anxa5b, hprt1l and elovl1a) responsible for swim  bladder development also showed decreased levels in response to DM treatments,  suggesting that DM might specifically affect swim bladder development.

To achieve this, animals  were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0  μg/L (DMSO, 0.001\%), 0.1 μg/L and 10 μg/L, and after the exposure period, the  tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis.

The mRNA expressions of  genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (tshβ, slc5a5 and tpo) were  upregulated significantly with acetochlor treatment, which might be responsible  for the increased thyroxine concentrations. The downregulation of genes related  to thyroid hormone metabolism (dio1 and ugt1ab) and transport (ttr) in zebrafish  larvae exposed to acetochlor might further explain the increased thyroxine levels  and decreased T3 levels. The mRNA expression of the thyroid hormone receptor  (trα) was also upregulated upon acetochlor exposure.

The objective  of this study was to determine the effect of DLD on the hepatic proteome in  zebrafish following dietary treatment as the liver is central to metabolism.  Females were fed a control dose or one of three doses of DLD-contaminated food  pellets over 21 days. Both label-free and iTRAQ proteomics were conducted as two  complementary methods to expand coverage of the proteome. Label-free proteomics  quantified 1563 proteins: 6 proteins showed a linear dose-response with DLD.  iTRAQ quantified {\textgreater}3500 proteins; 5 proteins were decreased and 34 proteins were  increased in abundance within the liver with all three doses. Overall, DLD  reduced the abundance of proteins associated with glucose and cholesterol  metabolism, lipid oxidation, liver function, and immune-related processes. Few  proteins were identified by both methods as being altered ({\textasciitilde}1\%), suggesting that  each method detected different subsets of proteins. Protein responses in the  liver were largely dependent on dose, however proteins related to liver and organ  function, centrosome separation, glucose/energy metabolism, and immune-related  pathways were confirmed by each independent technique and were suppressed with  DLD exposure. This study identifies proteomic responses that are associated with  organochlorine-induced hepatotoxicity. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Environmental  contaminants cause hepatotoxicity because the liver is the major organ for  detoxification. The legacy pesticide dieldrin significantly bioaccumulates in  tissues, and can affect molecular processes that can lead to liver pathology. LC  MS/MS proteomics identified protein networks related to tumors, energy  homeostasis, and chromosomal separation as those affected by dietary exposure to  dieldrin. We applied two orthogonal mass spectrometry-based methods to more  completely survey the liver proteome, strengthening data interpretation.

We have  characterized NaM toxicity during early life stage exposure in zebrafish.  Zebrafish embryos are most sensitive to NaM exposure during gastrulation and  early segmentation (4-14 hours post fertilization, hpf). For mortality, the dose  response curve is steep with an LC(50) estimate of 1.95 microM (248 ppb) at 48  hpf. The most notable malformation among surviving embryos was a severely twisted  notochord, which became evident by 24 hpf.

We have characterized the  notochord malformation using histological and in situ hybridization techniques.  collagen 2a1 mRNA expression is normally localized to the notochord sheath cells  at 24 hpf, whereas in NaM-exposed embryos it is misexpressed in the notochord  cells. Histological staining and myoD expression indicate that the myotomes of  the NaM-exposed embryos are less defined, compacted and block-shaped compared to  controls.

In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity  of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, resmethrin, and  bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and  lambda-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an  appropriate model for studying the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids.  Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in  mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At  doses approaching the LC(50), permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial  abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating  that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower  doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of  the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam  ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS-222  ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced  neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data  suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the  mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid  insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested  in mammalian systems.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfp258","Animals;Female;Reproducibility of Results;Risk Assessment;Biological Assay;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Pyrethrins/*toxicity;Insecticides/*toxicity;Abnormalities;Drug-Induced;Zebrafish/*embryology;Edema/chemically induced;Embryo;Nonmammalian/*drug effects/pathology;Teratogens/toxicity;Spasm/chemically induced;Neurons/*drug effects/pathology;Craniofacial Abnormalities/chemically induced;Aminobenzoates/pharmacology;Diazepam/pharmacology;GABA Antagonists/pharmacology;Neurotoxicity Syndromes/embryology/*etiology;Sodium Channel Blockers/pharmacology;Insecticides",NA,NA

The results indicated that, within the range of test atrazine  concentrations, either P450 content or P450 isozyme activities could be induced  by atrazine. Compared to controls, P450 content was significantly increased at  all atrazine concentrations at days 10, 15, and 20; thereafter, at day 25, all  concentrations decreased to approximately the control levels, both in males and  females. In addition, the strongest induction of P450 content was observed on day  15 in males and day 10 in females at treatment concentrations of 1 mg L(-1).  NADPH-P450 reductase activities showed mild increase in males; however, the  females exhibited significant induction on days 15, 20, and 25; especially, at  concentrations of 0.01 mg L(-1), the induction level was consistently increased  during the experiment. The inducements of APND and ERND in males were mainly  observed on the days 5, 10, and 15, which showed less distinct induction, while  significant induction was observed in cases of treatments during all days in  females. In conclusion, atrazine induces P450 enzymes in zebrafish, and the  effects may function as significant toxicity mechanisms in zebrafish.  Additionally, it also confirms the importance of using a combined multi-time and  multi-index diagnostic method to enhance the sensitivity and effectiveness of the  indices adopted.","Place: England","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.06.052","Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism;Water Pollutants;Chemical/*toxicity;Biomarkers/metabolism;NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/metabolism;Atrazine/*toxicity;Herbicides/*toxicity;Liver/drug effects/enzymology;Zebrafish/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism;Aminopyrine N-Demethylase/metabolism",NA,NA

However, the molecular causes of DDVP toxicity are poorly understood, especially  in cells other than neurons and muscle cells. To obtain a better understanding of  the process of non-neuronal DDVP toxicity, we exposed zebrafish to different  concentrations of DDVP, and investigated the resulting changes in liver histology  and gene transcription. RESULTS: Functional enrichment analysis of genes affected  by DDVP exposure identified a number of processes involved in energy utilization  and stress response in the liver. The abundance of transcripts for proteins  involved in glucose metabolism was profoundly affected, suggesting that carbon  flux might be diverted toward the pentose phosphate pathway to compensate for an  elevated demand for energy and reducing equivalents for detoxification.  Strikingly, many transcripts for molecules involved in β-oxidation and fatty acid  synthesis were down-regulated. We found increases in message levels for molecules  involved in reactive oxygen species responses as well as ubiquitination,  proteasomal degradation, and autophagy. To ensure that the effects of DDVP on  energy metabolism were not simply a consequence of poor feeding because of  neuromuscular impairment, we fasted fish for 29 or 50 h and analyzed liver gene  expression in them. The patterns of gene expression for energy metabolism in  fasted and DDVP-exposed fish were markedly different. CONCLUSION: We observed  coordinated changes in the expression of a large number of genes involved in  energy metabolism and responses to oxidative stress. These results argue that an  appreciable part of the effect of DDVP is on energy metabolism and is regulated  at the message level. Although we observed some evidence of neuromuscular  impairment in exposed fish that may have resulted in reduced feeding, the  alterations in gene expression in exposed fish cannot readily be explained by  nutrient deprivation.","","10.1186/s12864-015-1941-2","Animals;Gene Expression Profiling;Unfolded Protein Response;Cluster Analysis;Insecticides/*toxicity;Models;Biological;Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects;Signal Transduction/drug effects;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Dichlorvos/*toxicity;Zebrafish/genetics/*metabolism;Energy Metabolism/*drug effects/genetics;Cholinesterases/metabolism;Apoptosis/genetics;Carbohydrate Metabolism/genetics;Lipid Metabolism/genetics;Liver/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology;Energy Metabolism;Liver",NA,NA

Phenotypic analysis of  CPO-exposed embryos demonstrated that embryonic growth, as analyzed by gross  morphology, was normal in 85\% of treated embryos. Muscle fiber formation was  similar to control embryos as analyzed by birefringence, and nicotinic  acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) cluster formation was quantitatively similar to  control embryos as analyzed by α-bungarotoxin staining. These results indicate  that partial AChE activity during the early days of zebrafish development is  sufficient for general development, muscle fiber, and nAChR development.  Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons exhibited aberrant peripheral axon extension and  gene expression profiling suggests that several genes responsible for RB  neurogenesis are down-regulated.

Design: Systematic review of in vivo studies. Methods: Studies related to the research question were identified through searches in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov and the gray literature, from inception until November 2021. Rayyan was employed to screen and identify all studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Cochrane's revised Risk of Bias 2.0 and SYRCLE tools evaluated bias in RCTs and animal studies, respectively. An effect direction plot was developed to synthesize the evidence of the RCTs. Results: Twelve studies were identified and included in the qualitative synthesis (4 RCTs and 8 animal trials). Interventions included ketogenic diets (KDs), supplementation with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, caprylic acid administration and ketone ester drinks. The animal research used zebrafish and rodents, and PD was toxin-induced. Based on the available RCTs, ketogenic therapy does not improve motor coordination and functioning, cognitive impairment, anthropometrics, blood lipids and glycemic control, exercise performance or voice disorders in patients with PD. The evidence is scattered and heterogenous, with single trials assessing different outcomes; thus, a synthesis of the evidence cannot be conclusive regarding the efficacy of ketogenic therapy. On the other hand, animal studies tend to demonstrate more promising results, with marked improvements in locomotor activity, dopaminergic activity, redox status, and inflammatory markers. Conclusions: Although animal studies indicate promising results, research on the effect of ketogenic therapy in PD is still in its infancy, with RCTs conducted on humans being heterogeneous and lacking PD-specific outcomes.

Presently, drugs that is commercially available have unwanted side effects. Bacopa monnieri is known to have many positive effects such as strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, nonetheless, there is insufficient details regarding the effects toward this disease. Zebrafish is a reliable model to study neurological disease with the induction of rotenone. Rotenone cause effects toward zebrafish identical to Parkinson’s disease. Thus, the aim of this study is to study the effects of Bacopa monnieri toward rotenone induced zebrafish. 50 adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were separated into three groups. Group 1: Normal group (n=10), Group 2: Negative group (n=20), Group 3: Experimental group (n=20). The adult zebrafish were exposed to 5 μg/L rotenone for 28 days following with the treatment for 28 days using Bacopa monnieri with the concentration of 0.2348 mg/L. Lethal concentration (LC50) has been observed in 0.2348 mg/L treatment. Behaviour finding indicate that the adult zebrafish shows anxious response by measuring the time spent by the fish at the lower region of the tank. The fish also display slow swimming pattern after induced with rotenone, but it showed significant increased after the treatment. The increased swimming activity might be due to the antioxidant and therapeutic effects of Bacopa monnieri that significantly changed the behaviour of zebrafish. In conclusion, we found that Bacopa monnieri extract exhibits strong potential in treating Parkinson’s disease-induced zebrafish. © 2022, Medico Legal Society.

Antioxidant, non-cytotoxic, anti-genotoxic, anti-carcinogenic effects of boric acid, the salt compound of boron has been reported before. Boronic acids have been approved for treatment by FDA and are included in drug discovery studies and pyridine boronic acids are a subclass of heterocyclic boronic acids used in drug design and discovery as substituted pyridines based on crystal engineering principles. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of 3-pyridinylboronic acid in rotenone-exposed zebrafish embryos, focusing on oxidant-antioxidant parameters and gene expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target genes gclm, gclc, hmox1a, nqo1, and PD related genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dj1, and tnfα.

Our study showed for the first time that 3-pyridinylboronic acid, as a novel sub-class of the heterocyclic boronic acid compound, improved locomotor activities, ameliorated oxidant-antioxidant status by decreasing LPO and NO levels, and normalized the expressions of bdnf, dj1, tnf⍺ and Nrf2 target genes hmox1a and nqo1 in rotenone exposed zebrafish embryos. On the other hand, it caused the deterioration of the oxidant-antioxidant balance in the control group through increased lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide levels, and decreased antioxidant enzymes.

As these combined effects present additional dangers to food safety, we have compared individual to combined effects for a variety of pesticides. Carbendazim and chlorpyrifos are the two most commonly detected pesticides in vegetables, and previous studies reported that combined exposure results in synergistic developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos. In this study, individual and combined effects on zebrafish motor activity were examined following individual and combined exposure to assess nervous system toxicity. Further, transcriptomics methods were used to identify potential molecular mechanisms for individual and combined toxicity. Carbendazim alone induced a disorganized swim pattern characterized by increased angular velocity, turn angle, meander, and acceleration during light-dark transition, while chlorpyrifos alone reduced average swim speed and light-dark acceleration. Combined treatment significantly reduced average swim velocity and total distance traveled. Combination indices indicated strong antagonism between compounds for average speed and light-dark acceleration. Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) showed that carbendazim significantly altered the expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism, including ctslb, cyp7a1, hsp70l, and ugt1a1. Alternatively, chlorpyrifos significantly altered genes involved in various nervous system-related pathways, including glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and calcium signaling. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis suggested that chlorpyrifos significantly downregulated genes related to light transduction, resulting in decreased sensitivity to light-dark transitions, while antagonism mainly reflected divergent effects on phototransduction and retinol metabolism. Carbendazim had no significant effects on vision-related genes such as gnat1 and gngt1, while chlorpyrifos downregulated expression, an effect reversed by the combination.

The toxicity of each chemical and concentration was then determined by evaluating developmental abnormalities, behavioral alterations, and transcriptomic changes. We found the most significant outcomes resulted from dieldrin exposures as low as 1 nM at 0-5 dpf, or 0.1 nM at 4−5 dpf, including abnormalities in skeleton, swim bladder, and yolk sec, as well as hyperactive behavioral phenotypes.

To date, two ligands (Kiss1, Kiss2) and three kisspeptin receptors (Kissr1, Kissr2, Kissr3) have been identified in teleosts, likely due to whole-genome duplication and loss of genes that occurred early in teleost evolution. Recent results in zebrafish and medaka mutants have challenged the notion that the kisspeptin system is essential for reproduction in fish, in marked contrast to the situation in mammals. In this context, this review focuses on the role of kisspeptins at three levels of the reproductive, brain-pituitary-gonadal (BPG) axis in fish. In addition, this review compiled information on factors controlling the Kiss/Kissr system, such as photoperiod, temperature, nutritional status, sex steroids, neuropeptides, and others. In this article, we summarize the available information on the molecular diversity and evolution, tissue expression and neuroanatomical distribution, functional significance, signaling pathways, and gene regulation of Kiss and Kissr in teleost fishes. Of particular note are recent advances in understanding flatfish kisspeptin systems, which require further study to reveal their structural and functional diversity.

Calcium is very important for neuronal and glial cells, neurodegenerative disease mechanisms are closely related to disturbed calcium homeostasis. Recent studies strongly support the role of inflammation in nigrostriatal degeneration in PD. In recent years, Rifampicin, a macrocyclic antibiotic has been shown to have a protective effect on neurons. This study aims to evaluate the effects of rifampicin in the experimental PD model induced by rotenone in zebrafish focusing on the relationship between calcium-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Adult zebrafish were exposed to rotenone and rifampicin for 3 weeks. Locomotor activity was determined as the total distance that the zebrafish traveled for 5 min. Neuroinflammation and PD-related gene expressions were determined by RT-PCR. Mitochondrial calcium levels were determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Gamma synuclein, Park 7, Sigma-1 receptor expressions were determined by Western Blot.

However, when it comes to real-life aqueous systems polluted with more than one dissimilarly acting organic substances, the behavior of the materials may vary widely, depending on the nature of each substance. The study herein focuses on evaluating a magnetic Fe–Cu bimetallic nanomaterial in relation to its removal ability, employing a mixture of organic micropollutants from four chemical classes, as model micropollutants: four pesticides, two benzophenones, one nitrophenol, and one pharmaceutical compound. Based on the above, this research investigated (1) the role of synthesis conditions of Fe-Cu on the removal efficiency of the mixture of micropollutants, (2) the influence of several parameters on the removal performance including pH value, ionic strength, sample volume, sorbent mass, stirring rate, and time, and (3) the intrinsic mechanism(s) of removal of the mixtures of micropollutants. The optimal experimental conditions were identified and the involvement of sorption and degradation of the individual pollutants, to a different degree, were demonstrated. The combined action of each single metallic component of the bimetallic material was propitious to remove all substances in the highest yield. Apart from the batch conditions, a simple column elution study was also carried out. The treated mixture of the micropollutants was assessed in terms of its toxicity on zebrafish larvae to appraise its suitability for final discharge. The application of the procedure to a wastewater sample testified that the removal properties of Fe–Cu for the mixture of micropollutants are exploitable. The total removal yields from a treated wastewater and an aqueous standard solution were 88 ± 4% and 92 ± 4%, respectively.

However, the essential requirement for the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex—the molecular target of SDHIs—in energy metabolism for almost all extant eukaryotes and the lack of species specificity of these fungicides raise concerns about their toxicity toward off‐target organisms and, more generally, toward the environment. Herein we review the current knowledge on the toxicity toward zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) of nine commonly used SDHI fungicides: bixafen, boscalid, fluxapyroxad, flutolanil, isoflucypram, isopyrazam, penthiopyrad, sedaxane, and thifluzamide. The results indicate that these SDHIs cause multiple adverse effects in embryos, larvae/juveniles, and/or adults, sometimes at developmentally relevant concentrations. Adverse effects include developmental toxicity, cardiovascular abnormalities, liver and kidney damage, oxidative stress, energy deficits, changes in metabolism, microcephaly, axon growth defects, apoptosis, and transcriptome changes, suggesting that glycometabolism deficit, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are critical in the toxicity of most of these SDHIs. However, other adverse outcome pathways, possibly involving unsuspected molecular targets, are also suggested. Lastly, we note that because of their recent arrival on the market, the number of studies addressing the toxicity of these compounds is still scant, emphasizing the need to further investigate the toxicity of all SDHIs currently used and to identify their adverse effects and associated modes of action, both alone and in combination with other pesticides. © 2021 by the authors.

We investigated the biological effects along an advanced water treatment pilot plant, using zebrafish embryos throughout early development. The study compared phenotypic observations with global transcriptome responses, enabling us to keep an open mind about the chemicals that might influence the biological activity. There was no evidence of acute toxicity at any treatment stage, but skeletal, cardiovascular and pigmentation changes occurred in a small proportion of embryos along the treatment process, and in a tap water; not detected in the aquarium water control. Reverse osmosis (RO) reduced the concentration of measured chemical contaminants in the water the most, while eliminating the occurrence of abnormalities detected in fish embryos. Conversely, advanced oxidation reversed the benefits of RO treatment by increasing the frequency of teratogenic and sub-lethal abnormalities seen. Using the molecular responses of zebrafish embryos to different IPR water, we report the bioactivity within the water at different stages of advanced treatment and associate these to perturbed biological functions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations to the retinoid system, which was consistent with the observed teratogenic effects. Changes to tryptophan metabolism (associated with the production of melatonin required for the control of normal circadian rhythms) and somatolactin-beta (associated with normal pigmentation in fish) were also found. We show that underexplored forms of biological activity occur in treated wastewater effluent, and/or may be created depending on the type of advanced treatment process used.

Pathological processes causing PD were suggested to initiate in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and proceed to the central nervous system (CNS).

Caprylic acid (C8) is the principal fatty acid component of the medium-chain triglycerides in the ketogenic diets. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of caprylic acid, in neurotoxin exposed zebrafish focusing on the relationship between intestinal and brain oxidative stress and inflammation. Methods: Adult zebrafish were exposed to rotenone (5 μg/L) (R group) and caprylic acid (20 and 60 mg/mL) (L + HDCA and R + HDCA groups) for 30 days. At the end of 30 days locomotor activities were determined.

The use of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is the basis of most animal models of PD. MPTP is metabolized by monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) to MPP + and induces the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in mammals. Zebrafish have been commonly used in developmental biology as a model organism, but owing to its perfect mix of properties, it is now emerging as a model for human diseases. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are cheap and easy to sustain, evolve rapidly, breed transparent embryos in large amounts, and are readily manipulated by different methods, particularly genetic ones. Furthermore, zebrafish are vertebrate species and mammalian findings obtained from zebrafish may be more applicable than those derived from genetic models of invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The resemblance cannot be taken for granted, however. The goal of the present review article is to highlight the promise of zebrafish as a PD animal model. As its aminergic structures, MPTP mode of action, and PINK1 roles mimic those of mammalians, zebrafish seems to be a viable model for studying PD.

Recent studies have identified T. purpurea as a source of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. Aim: In this study, we have established the potential of T. purpurea as a potential source of drugs against Parkinsonism using an oxidopamine (6-OHDA) model. Methods: Metabolomics profiling of T. purpurea extract (TPE) was obtained using the HR-LCMS method. Enzymatic activities of Catalase, Glutathione, Superoxide Dismutase and Malondialdehyde were measured in vitro. Reactive Oxygen Species generation capacity and the mitochondrial membrane potential were also determined. The zebrafish embryos were treated with oxidopamine along with varying concentrations of T. purpurea extract and the swimming pattern and total distance travelled was evaluated. The mRNA expression of mitophagy related genes were measured using RT-PCR studies. Results: The metabolite profile of T. purpurea identified the presence of various polyphenols such as Genistein, Esculetin, and Chrysin that have neuroprotective effects. 6-OHDA-induced PD causes an increase in oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species generation, and affects mitochondrial stability. There was a significant increase in the catalase, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels and a decrease in Malondialdehyde and Reactive Oxygen Species levels in cells treated with TPE when compared to 6-OHDA treated cells. We then treated zebrafish embryos with 6-OHDA along with varying concentrations of T. purpurea extract, and the mRNA expression and swimming pattern were evaluated. The embryos cotreated with TPE showed improved swim pattern similar to untreated embryos, whereas those treated with the positive control failed to do so. T. purpurea extract also significantly decreased the expressions of casp3, casp9, lrrk2, and increased pink1 and parkin expression. Conclusion: Our study identifies Tephrosia purpurea extract as a viable candidate against 6-OHDA induced-neurotoxicity, and further studies of its effect in models of neurodegenerative diseases are required. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Historically, vineyards use large quantities of phytosanitary products, such as Bordeaux mixture [Ca(OH)2 + CuSO4], to control plant diseases.

Thus, it is important to evaluate whether the presence of Cu-bearing particles in water is toxic to aquatic fauna. This study conducted chemical, mineralogical, and particle size evaluations on water samples and sediments collected from a watershed predominantly cultivated with old vineyards. The proportion of Cu-rich nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) in the sediment was ~27%. We exposed zebrafish to different dilutions of water and sediment samples that collected directly from the study site (downstream river) under laboratory conditions. Then, we evaluated their exploratory behavior and the stress-related endocrine parameter, whole-body cortisol. We also carried out two experiments in which zebrafish were exposed to Cu. First, we determined the median lethal concentration (LC50–96 h) of Cu and then assessed whether Cu exposure results in effects similar to those associated with exposure to the water and sediment samples collected from the study site. The water and sediment samples directly impacted the exploratory behavior of zebrafish, showing clear anxiety-like behavioral phenotype and stress in terms of cortisol increase (during the second rain event). The Cu exposure did not mimic the same behavioral changes triggered by the water and sediment samples, although it had caused similar stress in the fish.

As a result, the behavior measurement of early stages of zebrafish embryos such as locomotor response, photomotor response and spontaneous tail coiling are considered as a valid alternative to adult animal testing. In this study, we developed a workflow to investigate the spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of zebrafish embryos and to accurately measure the STC effect in the KNIME software. We validated the STC protocol with 3 substances (abamectin, chlorpyrifos-oxon and pyracostrobin) which have different mechanisms of action. The KNIME workflow combined with easy and cost-effective method of video acquisition makes this STC protocol a valuable method for neurotoxicity testing. • Video acquisition duration of 60 s at 25 ± 1 hpf was used • 20 embryos exposed per dish and acclimatized for 30 min before video acquisition • Capability to inspect and correct errors for high accuracy © 2021","","10.1016/j.mex.2021.101330","",NA,NA

The results showed that CMIT/MIT exposure causes bent tail, pericardial edema, altered heart rates, global DNA hypermethylation and significant alterations in the locomotion behavior. Consistent with the morphological and physiological endpoints, proteomics profiling with bioinformatics analysis suggested that the suppression of cardiac muscle contractions and energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) were possible pivotal underlying mechanisms of the CMIT/MIT mediated adverse effects.

Since there are no vaccines against chikungunya and Zika, and vaccines against dengue still have a set of restrictions, the control of Aedes aegypti population represents the main strategy for reducing the spread of these diseases. The chemical control of A. aegypti has used pesticides of organochlorine, organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid classes. However, there are reports that A. aegypti has developed resistance to these compounds and thus more effective agents are urgently necessary. In this scenario, compounds expressed by the multipurpose plant Moringa oleifera have been investigated for effects on A. aegypti. This chapter provides a review on the insecticidal activity of M. oleifera metabolites and their modes-of action. Additionally, insights into the safety of their use are discussed. There are many reports of preparations from M. oleifera seeds or flowers, obtained with different solvents such as water, saline solution, and petroleum ether, able to kill A. aegypti larvae or eggs. The seed oil was also reported to be active against this insect. These effects were attributed to the action of secondary metabolites, lectins (carbohydratebinding proteins) or protease inhibitors, which can impair digestion and absorption of nutrients and damage the structure of larval midgut. Embryocidal activity, ability of arresting or delaying larval development, and interference with the oviposition behavior were described. The investigation of M. oleifera preparations for toxicity on non-target organisms, such as Danio rerio, or genotoxicity showed that their use on natural environments requires caution and must comply with concentration limits. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","Moringa;Moringa oleifera;Aedes",NA,NA

The ZET assay focuses on the early stages of embryo development and is considered a more humane model compared to adult zebrafish testing. A complementary model has been developed that exposes larvae to toxicants at a later time point during development where body patterning has already been established.

Multi-Target-Directed Ligand (MTDL), which is rationally designed to simultaneously hit multiple targets to improve the pharmacological profiles, has been developed as a promising approach for drug discovery against AD. To identify the multifunctional agents for AD, we developed an innovative method to successfully conceal the metal chelator into acetylcholinesterase (AChE)inhibitor. Briefly, the “hidden” agents first cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)to inhibit the function of AChE, and the metal chelator will then be released via the enzymatic hydrolysis by AChE. Therefore, the AChE inhibitor, in this case, is not only a single-target agent against AD, but also a carrier of the metal chelator. In this study a total of 14 quinoline derivatives were synthesized and biologically evaluated. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that compound 9b could cross the BBB efficiently, then release 8a, the metabolite of 9b, into brain. In vitro, 9b had a potent AChE inhibitory activity, while 8a displayed a significant metal ion chelating function, therefore in combination, both 9b and 8a exhibited a considerable inhibition of Aβ aggregation, one of the observations that plays important roles in the pathogenesis of AD.

The model neuroactive compounds were largely behaviorally bioactive (20 of 30) with most effects phenotypic of their known modes of action. Flavonoids rapidly and broadly elicited hyperactive locomotor effects (22 of 24). Multidimensional analyses compared responses over time and identified three distinct bioactive groups of flavonoids based on efficacy and potency. Using GABAergics to modulate hyperactive responses, two flavonoids, (S)-equol and kaempferol were tested for GABAA receptor antagonism, as well as a known GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin. Pharmacological intervention with positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, alfaxalone and chlormethiazole, ameliorated the hyperactive response to picrotoxin, but not for (S)-equol or kaempferol. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that flavonoids are differentially bioactive and that the chemobehavioral effects likely do not involve a GABAA receptor mediated mode of action. Overall, the integrative zebrafish platform provides a useful framework for comparatively evaluating high-content chemobehavioral data for sets of structurally- and mechanistically-related flavonoids and neuroactive compounds. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","","10.1016/j.taap.2018.02.019","Flavonoids",29499247,NA

Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the “environmental obesogens” hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause “transgenerational effects” by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of TBT (0.01, 0.1, 1 nM) to determine how low levels affected development and behavior. Fish exposed to 1 nM TBT hatched earlier when compared to controls. Following a 96-h exposure, total swimming distance, velocity, and activity of zebrafish larvae were reduced compared to controls. To identify putative mechanisms for these altered endpoints, we assessed embryo bioenergetics and gene expression. We reasoned that the accelerated hatch time could be related to ATP production and energy, thus embryos were exposed to TBT for 24 and 48-h exposure prior to hatch. There were no differences among groups for endpoints related to bioenergetics (i.e. basal, ATP-dependent, and maximal respiration). To address mechanisms related to changes in behavioral activity, we measured transcripts associated with muscle function (myf6, myoD, and myoG) and dopamine signaling (th, dat, dopamine receptors) as dopamine regulates behavior. No transcript was altered in expression by TBT in larvae, suggesting that other mechanisms exist that may explain changes in higher level endpoints.

We show that both A6 and an anilinopyrimidine, cyprodinyl, decrease larval survival and affect central neurons at micromolar concentrations. Focusing on a superficial and easily observable sensory system, the lateral line system, we found that defects in axonal and sensory cell regeneration can be observed at much lower doses, in the nanomolar range. We also show that A6 accumulates preferentially in lateral line neurons and hair cells. We examined whether A6 affects the expression of putative target genes, and found that genes involved in apoptosis/cell proliferation are down-regulated, as well as genes reflecting estrogen receptor activation, consistent with previous reports that anilinopyrimidines act as endocrine disruptors. On the other hand, canonical targets of endocrine signaling are not affected, suggesting that the neurotoxic effect of A6 may be due to the binding of this compound to a recently identified, neuron-specific estrogen receptor. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","","10.3390/ijms17122137","",27999363,NA

The main objective of the present study was to assess uptake and elimination kinetics of PFPiAs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) following aqueous exposure. The results showed that PFPiA exposure can result in very high steady-state bioconentration factors (BCFss), compared to perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates.C6/C10 PFPiA exhibited the highest BCFss, ranging between 107 and 1010, orders of magnitude higher than those for long-chain perfluorocarboxylates. Strong positive relationships were observed between BCFss versus the membrane-water distribution coefficient (Dmw) and the protein-water partition coefficient (Kpw) of the studied perfluoroalkyl substances. However, BCFss exhibited a substantial drop for the very hydrophobic PFPiAs (C8/C10 and C6/C12 PFPiAs). The reduced BCFss of these long-chain PFPiAs (perfluoroalkyl chain length = 18; Dmw = 109) is likely the result of reduced bioavailability due to interaction with solute molecules/organic matter present in the water phase and/or reduced gill membrane permeability. While PFPiAs can be metabolized to perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acids, the metabolic transformation rate seems insufficient to counteract the high degree of uptake across gill membranes.

It covers two major areas of zebrafish biology, reproduction and development, with toxicology emphasized in a number of chapters. Historically, reproductive biology of zebrafish has not been given the attention afforded to the more intensively studied aspects of embryonic development in this model species. In part, this may be due to fewer tools available to zebrafish reproductive biologists. However, with the advent of transparent juvenile and adult lines, new areas of reproduction research become visible both figuratively and literally. Two chapters are devoted to presenting these exciting new fish lines and examples of their use in research to the reproductive biology research community. Reproduction and embryonic development are a continuum which is emphasized in a new review on RNA-binding proteins in the zebrafish oocyte. It is increasingly clear that embryonic development is dependent upon factors present in the female gamete known collectively as ""maternal effects"", and these oocyte components are beautifully summarized in this chapter. Other chapters cover normal spawning periodicity and vitellogenic oocyte growth dynamics that should interest ovarian physiologists and those interested in zebrafish husbandry. Further sections of this book describe experiments centered on zebrafish development. One section focuses on experiments involving the protein localization of the Sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (Slc12a2) during zebrafish embryogenesis and has an emphasis on myogenesis. Another section introduces the zebrafish dead elvis (del) mutant. This section highlights experiments involving whole-mount immunohistochemistry experiments describing the muscle defects as well as the positional cloning and complementation analysis indicating that dead elvis carries a mutation of the Titina gene. The advantage of using the zebrafish as a basic model for kidney development research is comprehensively reviewed. This section considers technology available for use in zebrafish including; morpholinos, CRISPR-Cas, and TALENs. These are discussed with regard to better understanding nephrogenesis in zebrafish. Another overarching topic presented in several chapters of this book highlights the zebrafish as a model vertebrate for toxicological screening and understanding exposure rates during reproduction, development and throughout life. Basic procedures for toxicant testing are discussed in relationship to organogenesis and are extended beyond establishing a simple lethal concentration dose for the organism. Another chapter appraised three different assays and their usage to screen for toxicant-induced behavioral defects using zebrafish. Specific sections within this book emphasize research and the current understanding of lead neurotoxicity. Also, a standard test procedure is introduced using zebrafish to better understand gene expression changes in response to pesticide exposures. Overall, these chapters discuss procedures, assays, and different mechanisms that environmental toxicants use to influence development and behavior.

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the ADHD stimulant medication methylphenidate 0-5. days post fertilization (12.5-50. mg/l). They were tested for long-term behavioral effects as adults. Methylphenidate exposure (50. mg/l) caused significant increases in dopamine, norepinepherine and serotonin on day 6 but not day 30 after fertilization.

Biogenic amine transporters regulate neurotransmission by removing neurotransmitters from synapses and extracellular fluid. Despite evolutionary divergence, teleost fish and mammalian transporter proteins appear similar, particularly at active binding sites. However, it is not clear if the similarities extend to functional responses, reuptake-inhibiting drugs, or involvement in delayed neurotoxic responses to pesticide exposures. Under certain exposure conditions, alterations in expression and function of these transporters may be more sensitive biomarkers of pesticide exposure or neurodegenerative disease risk than acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavioral assays targeting associative responses such as anxiety are useful as pharmacological and toxicological screens, or for studying modulation of behavior by central neurotransmitter systems. In novel environments, zebrafish go to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, a stereotypical behavior (attributed to predator anxiety) forming the basis of the novel light/dark aquatic plus maze characterized in this chapter. Such behavioral paradigms are an essential component to establish zebrafish as pharmacological and toxicological research models. Herein adult zebrafish are exposed to reuptake inhibitors and representative organochloride, organophosphate, or pyrethroid pesticides at 1 μg day-1 for 21 days, tested for anxious response in the light/dark plus maze, then assayed for dopamine and serotonin transporter density by radioligand binding. Exposures to these compounds variably affect dopamine and serotonin transporter density and alter behavior in the maze as compared to controls. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","10.1007/978-1-60761-922-2_8","Pesticides;Amines;Amination",NA,NA

Seminal findings have been uncovered in both mammalian and non-mammalian model in large result of the extraordinary conservation of both genetic elements and differentiation processes between mammals and non-mammalians. Emerging model organisms, such as the nematode and zebrafish have made it possible to assess the effects of small molecules rapidly, inexpensively, and on a miniaturized scale. By combining the scale and throughput of in vitro screens with the physiological complexity and traditional animal studies, these models are providing relevant information on molecular events in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. The utility of these models is largely driven by the functional conservation seen between them and higher organisms, including humans so that knowledge obtained using non-mammalian model systems can often provide a better understanding of equivalent processes, pathways, and mechanisms in man. Understanding the molecular events that trigger neurodegeneration has also greatly relied upon the use of tissue culture models. The purpose of this summary is to provide-state-of-the-art review of recent developments of non-mammalian experimental models and their utility in addressing issues pertinent to neurotoxicity (Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio). The synopses by Aschner and Levin summarize how genetic mutants of these species can be used to complement the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with neurobehavioral toxicity and neurodegeneration. Next, studies by Suñol and Olopade detail the predictive value of cultures in assessing neurotoxicity. Suñol and colleagues summarize present novel information strategies based on in vitro toxicity assays that are predictive of cellular effects that can be extrapolated to effects on individuals.

The field of neurobehavioral genetics is becoming mature. Genetic factors contributing to neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have been found and evidence for genetic factors contributing to other diseases such as schizophrenia and autism are likely. This genetic approach can also benefit the field of behavioral neurotoxicology. It is clear that there is substantial heterogeneity of response with behavioral impairments resulting from neurotoxicants. Many factors contribute to differential sensitivity, but it is likely that genetic variability plays a prominent role. Important discoveries concerning genetics and behavioral neurotoxicity are being made on a broad front from work with invertebrate and piscine mutant models to classic mouse knockout models and human epidemiologic studies of polymorphisms.

TCS has been detected in surface water in several countries, and its ecological impact is largely unknown. In this work, the toxicity of TCS in zebrafish (Danio rerio), embryos and adults was studied. Several lethal and sub-lethal endpoints were analysed in organisms exposed to TCS such as mortality, embryo development and behaviour, hatching, micronuclei and biochemical markers (cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)). Materials and methods Embryo/larvae assay followed the OECD guideline on Fish Embryo Toxicity Test. Embryos were exposed at nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mg/l of TCS for 6 days and were inspected daily with the help of a stereomicroscopy for mortality, developmental parameters (otolith formation, eye and body pigmentation, somite formation, heart beat, tail circulation, detachment of the tail-bud from the yolk sac) and hatching. A similar test was run to obtain larvae for ChE, GST and LDH analysis. The adult test followed the OECD Guideline TG 203 in semi-static conditions. Adult zebrafish of similar length and age were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mg/l of TCS for 96 h and were inspected daily for mortality and behaviour alterations. A second test was run to obtain organs for biomarkers analysis: Heads, muscles and gills were isolated and snap-frozen in eppendorfs and used for ChE, LDH and GST determinations, respectively. Adult zebrafish testing also comprised a third test for micronucleus analysis in which the nominal concentrations of 0, 0.175 and 0.350 mg/l were used. Peripheral blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and used for the analysis. Results TCS showed acute toxicity for embryo/larvae (96 h LC50 = 0.42 mg/l) and delayed hatching. Moreover, embryo toxicity was evident: Delay on the otolith formation and eye and body pigmentation were found, and malformations were also evident, including spine malformations, pericardial oedema and undersize. Biomarkers levels were affected: ChE and LDH activity were increased in larvae exposed to 0.25 mg/l, and GST activity was increased in larvae exposed to 0.25 and 0.35 mg/l. TCS also demonstrated acute toxicity to adult zebrafish (96 h LC50 = 0.34 mg/l). However, TCS did not change biomarkers levels and did not elicit a micronucleus in adults. Discussions Despite the fact that similar 96 h LC50 values have been found for D. rerio embryos and adults (0.42 and 0.34 mg/l, respectively), the embryo assay was much more informative, showing important effects at several levels, including teratogenic response, hatching delay and alteration of biomarker levels. TCS does not seem to be genotoxic for adult fish or to interfere with biomarkers levels at the concentrations tested. Conclusions TCS has deleterious effects on zebrafish adults and during early stages, (including embryotoxicity, hatching delay and alterations of biomarkers levels). The range of endpoints used on the embryo test allows an integrated analysis that contributes to a better understanding of the toxicity and mode of action of TCS. Recommendations and perspectives Future works should focus on a deeper investigation of TCS modes of action on zebrafish early-life stages. As embryo testing was revealed to be so informative, a refinement of the test could be made, including other endpoints such as different biochemical markers as well as DNA microarrays to assess a gene expression level for the effect of exposure to TCS. In the perspective of risk assessment, these endpoints should be explored in order to assess their usefulness as early warning signs and links should be sought between these short-term tests and effects of long-term exposures as it is observed in more realistic scenarios. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","","10.1007/s11356-009-0119-3","",19283420,NA

Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms. Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies. Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure. Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes. Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded. At present the ecological consequences of these findings remain obscure. However, a multiple-stress resistance may be acquired which improves the individual fitness in a fluctuating environment. Conclusions. It appears that dissolved HS have to be considered abiotic ecological driving forces, somewhat less obvious than temperature, nutrients, or light. Perspectives. The understanding of the ecological control by dissolved humic substances is still fragmentary and needs to be studied in more details. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","","10.1065/espr2007.07.434","",18380231,NA

Atrazine is linked to endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity, and cancer, with delayed health effects observed after developmental exposure in line with the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that embryonic atrazine exposure induces delayed neurotoxicity in adult female zebrafish (Danio rerio), embryos were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb atrazine during embryogenesis (1–72 h post fertilization (hpf)) and raised to adults with no additional atrazine exposure. Behavioral outcomes were tested through a novel tank test, light-dark box, and open field test and indicated female zebrafish had more anxious phenotypes at 9 months post fertilization (mpf). Female brain transcriptomic analysis at 9 mpf found altered gene expression pathways related to organismal injury and cancer with beta-estradiol and estrogen receptor as top upstream regulators. These results were compared to 9 mpf male and 6 mpf female groups with the same atrazine embryonic exposures and showed differences in specific genes that were altered, but similarities in top molecular pathways. Molecular pathways associated with behavior were observed only in the 6 mpf transcriptomic profiles, suggesting prediction of observed behavioral outcomes at 9 mpf. The expression of genes associated with serotonin neurotransmission was also evaluated at 14 mpf to determine persistence; however, no significant changes were observed. Brain global methylation in 12 mpf zebrafish observed an increased percent 5 mC in females with embryonic 0.3 ppb atrazine exposure. Finally, the body length, body weight, and brain weight were determined at 14 mpf and were altered in all treatment groups.

Under TCS exposure from 62.5 to 250 μg/L, several osteodevelopmental malformations were observed, such as defect of craniofacial cartilage, pharyngeal arch cartilage dysplasia, and impairments on skeletal mineralization. Further, the morphology of mature chondrocytes became swollen and deformed, their number decreased, nucleus displacement occurred, and most immature chondrocytes were crowded at both ends of ceratobranchial. SEM observation of larval caudal fin revealed that, the layer of collagen fibers and the mineralized calcium nodules were significantly decreased, with the collagen fibers becoming shorter upon TCS exposure. The activity of bone-derived alkaline phosphatase significantly reduced, and marker functional genes related to cartilage and osteoblast development were abnormally expressed. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis indicated, that changes in marker genes intimately related to the negative regulation of miR-30c-5p overexpression targeted by TCS, and the up-regulation of miR-30c induced bone developmental defects by inhibiting the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. These findings were confirmed by artificially intervening the expression of miR-30c and using BMP pathway agonists in vivo. In sum, TCS induced osteototoxicity by targeting miR-30c up-regulation and interfering in the BMP signaling pathway.

In this study, the developmental toxicity of these drugs (0.5 μg·L−1–500 μg·L−1) to zebrafish, an aquatic model organism, was investigated; and the epigenetic toxicity of BZB was also explored. For all four drugs, the results showed that the drugs exposure could cause sublethal toxic effects on zebrafish larvae, such as decreases in hatching rate, body length, and heart rate. ATO also induced the swelling of the eyes of larvae by 5 %–15 %. Yolk sac edema, pericardial edema, bent spine, and tail malformation were observed in larvae exposed to the drugs, and yolk sac edema was the most common malformation. In addition, the spontaneous movement and free-swimming activity could be inhibited by the drugs. Combined with RNA-seq results, the adverse development of larvae in exposure groups may be caused by the disruption of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and the development and function of eye and nervous system. After a 30-day uptake period, the accumulation of BZB and the decrease of global DNA methylation level were observed in the liver, kidneys, gut, gills, and brain of adult zebrafish (4-month-old) exposed to 0.5 μg·L−1 to 500 μg·L−1 BZB.

In the present study, we used zebrafish's early stages as a model, given their well-acknowledged predictive value in the risk assessment of chemicals. This study was designed to investigate the morphological and morphometric alterations induced by Pb during zebrafish's early development and disclose the putative effects stage- and/or dose-dependent. We examined injuries induced by two environmentally relevant and extremely low concentrations of Pb (2.5 μg/L and 5 μg/L) during two exposure windows: early (between 1 and 7 dpf) and late (between 2 and 8 dpf). We clearly demonstrated that the incidence and severity of morphological abnormalities increased with increasing Pb dose and exposure time in both early and late-exposed groups. Furthermore, we revealed that malformation severity was significantly higher in the early exposed group than in the late exposure group at all exposure times and for both tested doses, thus highlighting the high sensitivity of zebrafish during the initial stages of development. The information presented in this paper emphasizes the effectiveness of morphological biomarkers in unveiling threatening situations and supports the role of zebrafish embryos and larvae in risk assessment and environmental monitoring. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136095","",35995187,NA

Zebrafish are a popular biological model because they share early development pathways with humans. A dietary exposure paradigm is growing in popularity in the zebrafish model because the outcomes often translate to humans. To create a diet of known composition, it is crucial to understand background PFAS levels present in zebrafish diet. Background PFAS, if present, potentially confounds interpretation of toxicological data. To date, no studies document the PFAS background levels in laboratory fish diet and there is only limited information on some pet foods. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an analytical method for up to 50 target PFAS in high lipid and protein content laboratory fish diets and pet foods. Long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (C9-C13) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were quantified in 11 out of 16 laboratory fish diets and in three out of five pet fish foods. Foods for pet birds, lizards, and dogs were below the limit of detection for all PFAS. In two of the laboratory fish diets, PFOS concentrations were >1.3 ng/g and the total PFAS for the three laboratory fish diets exceeded 1.0 ng/g. Hundreds of biomedical laboratories across the world utilize these commercial laboratory fish diets, and these results indicate that numerous zebrafish colonies may be inadvertently receiving significant dietary PFAS exposures. In light of this new information, it is critical to design PFAS studies with appropriate controls with measured background PFAS concentrations in the diet and to urge caution when interpreting the results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156831","",35750184,NA

The small vertebrate zebrafish is a leading model organism for toxicological studies. The ability to continuously monitor the toxicity of drugs, pollutants, or environmental changes over several days in zebrafish can have high practical application. Although video-recordings can be used to monitor short-term zebrafish behaviour, it is challenging to videorecord prolonged experiments (e.g. circadian behaviour over several days) because of the darkness periods (nights) and the heavy data storage and image processing requirements. Alternatively, infrared-based activity monitors, widely used in invertebrate models such as drosophila, generate simple and low-storage data and could optimize large-scale prolonged behavioural experiments in zebrafish, thus favouring the implementation of high-throughput testing strategies. Here, we validate the use of a Locomotor Activity Monitor (LAM) to study the behaviour of zebrafish larvae, and we characterize the behavioural phenotypes induced by abnormal light conditions and by the Parkinsonian toxin MPP+. When zebrafish were deprived from daily light-cycle synchronization, the LAM detected various circadian disruptions, such as increased activity period, phase shifts, and decreased inter-daily stability. Zebrafish exposed to MPP+ (10, 100, 500 μM) showed a concentration-dependent decrease in activity, sleep disruptions, impaired habituation to repetitive startles (visual-motor responses), and a slower recovery to normal activity after the startle-associated stress. These phenotypes evidence the feasibility of using infrared-based LAM to assess multi-parameter behavioural disruptions in zebrafish.

Previous studies using zebrafish (Danio rerio) have described the effects of acetaminophen on liver development and physiology, and a few have described gross physiological and morphological defects. Using a high but non-embryonic lethal dose of acetaminophen, we probed for defects in zebrafish craniofacial cartilage development. Strikingly, acetaminophen treatment caused severe craniofacial cartilage defects, primarily affecting both the presence and morphology of pharyngeal arch-derived cartilages of the viscerocranium. Delaying acetaminophen treatment restored developing cartilages in an order correlated with their corresponding pharyngeal arches, suggesting that acetaminophen may target pharyngeal arch development. Craniofacial cartilages are derived from cranial neural crest cells; however, many neural crest cells were still seen along their expected migration paths, and most remaining cartilage precursors expressed the neural crest markers sox9a and sox10, then eventually col2a1 (type II collagen). Therefore, the defects are not primarily due to an early breakdown of neural crest or cartilage differentiation. Instead, apoptosis is increased around the developing pharyngeal arches prior to chondrogenesis, further suggesting that acetaminophen may target pharyngeal arch development. Many craniofacial muscles, which develop in close proximity to the affected cartilages, were also absent in treated larvae. Taken together, these results suggest that high amounts of acetaminophen can disrupt multiple aspects of craniofacial development in zebrafish. © 2022 by the authors.","","10.3390/jdb10030030","Acetaminophen;Cartilage",NA,NA

In this study, the behaviors, neurochemicals, and gut microbiota of adult zebrafish were investigated after 2 months of exposure to CP at 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 µg/L. Behavioral assays revealed that CP increased locomotion and anxiety, and decreased the cognition of zebrafish. The alteration of neurotransmitters and related gene expressions in the dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid pathways induced by CP may be responsible for the observed changes in locomotion and cognition of adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, CP increased the anxiety of adult zebrafish through the serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine pathways in the brain. In addition, increased abundances of Fusobacteriales, Reyanellales, Staphylococcales, Rhodobacterals, and Patescibateria in the intestine at the CP-50 treatment were observed.

In this study, we used low-dose Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to disrupt the inflammation homeostasis in the liver of zebrafish and explored the hepatotoxicity of triptolide under an inflammatory state. Compared with the Triptolide group, LPS-Triptolide cotreatment exacerbate the liver injury with a remarkable decrease of liver size and liver-specific fluorescence intensity, accompanied by significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Liver cell damages were further demonstrated by histological staining and scanning electron microscopy observation. Lipid metabolism was severely impaired as indicated by delayed yolk sac absorption, accumulated triglycerides in the liver, and dysregulation of the related genes, such as ppar-α, cpt-1, mgst, srebf1/2, and fasn. Oxidative stress could be involved in the molecular mechanism as the Nrf2/keap1 antioxidant pathways were down-regulated when the zebrafish in an inflammatory state. Moreover, the expression of autophagy-related genes such as beclin, atg5, map1lc3b, and atg3 was also dysregulated. Finally, apoptosis was significantly induced in responses to LPS-Triptolide co-treatment. We speculate that triptolide could exacerbate the immune response and impair lipid metabolism, resulting in enhanced sensitivity of the zebrafish liver to triptolide-induced toxic effects through disruption of the antioxidant system and induction of apoptosis.

The results showed that 100 μg/L BPS exposure increased DNA methylation in F1 testes, and 1 μg/L BPS led to DNA methylation in F2 ovaries. The increased DNA methylation levels led to decreased expression of steroidogenic enzymes, including cyp11a, cyp17 and 3βhsd, which might be a main reason for the elevated plasma 17β-estradiol and decreased testosterone levels. In addition, sex ratio indicated a female dominance trend, and reproductive capacity of male fish was severely impaired.

Besides the well-investigated function of dysfunctional glutamate receptor signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), like autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might also be partly caused by disturbed glutamate signaling during development. However, the underlying mechanism of the type III metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGluR8 or GRM8) involvement in neurodevelopment and disease mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that the expression pattern of the two orthologs of human GRM8, grm8a and grm8b, have evolved partially distinct expression patterns in the brain of zebrafish (Danio rerio), especially at adult stages, suggesting sub-functionalization of these two genes during evolution. Using double in situ hybridization staining in the developing brain we demonstrate that grm8a is expressed in a subset of gad1a-positive cells, pointing towards glutamatergic modulation of GABAergic signaling. Building on this result we generated loss-of-function models of both genes using CRISPR/Cas9. Both mutant lines are viable and display no obvious gross morphological phenotypes making them suitable for further analysis. Initial behavioral characterization revealed distinct phenotypes in larvae. Whereas grm8a mutant animals display reduced swimming velocity, grm8b mutant animals show increased thigmotaxis behavior, suggesting an anxiety-like phenotype. We anticipate that our two novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 zebrafish models may contribute to a deeper understanding of its function in normal development and its role in the pathomechanism of disorders of the central nervous system.

The exponential increase in REEs utilization might elevate the toxicity to aquatic animals if they are released into the water due to uncareful handling. The specific objective of our study is to explore comprehensively the critical factor of a model Lanthanide complex electronic structures for the acute toxicity of REEs based on utilizing zebrafish as a model animal. Based on the 96 h LC50 test, we found that the majority of light REEs display lower LC50 values (4.19–25.17 ppm) than heavy REEs (10.30–41.83 ppm); indicating that they are atomic number dependent. Later, linear regression analyses further show that the average carbon charge on the aromatic ring (aromatic Cavg charge) can be the most significant electronic structural factor responsible for the Lanthanides’ toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Our results confirm a very strong correlation of LC50 to Lanthanide’s atomic numbers (r = 0.72), Milliken charge (r = 0.70), and aromatic Cavg charge (r = −0.85). This most significant correlation suggests a possible toxicity mechanism that the Lanthanide cation’s capability to stably bind to the aromatic ring on the residue of targeted proteins via a covalent chelating bond. Instead, the increasing ionic bond character can reduce REEs’ toxicity.

Currently, there are few reports on the toxicity of PCNB to zebrafish embryo. Here, we evaluated the toxicity of PCNB in aquatic vertebrates using a zebrafish model. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to PCNB at concentrations of 0.25 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, and 0.75 mg/L from 6 hpf to 72 hpf resulted in abnormal embryonic development, including cardiac malformation, pericardial edema, decreased heart rate, decreased blood flow velocity, deposition at yolk sac, shortened body length, and increased distance between venous sinus and arterial bulb (SV-BA). The expression of genes related to cardiac development was disordered. However, due to the unstable embryo status in the 0.75 mg/L exposure concentration group, the effect of PCNB on the expression levels of cardiac-related genes was not concentration-dependent. We found that PCNB increased reactive oxygen species stress levels in zebrafish, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and catalase (CAT) activity, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The increased level of oxidative stress reduced the proliferation ability of zebrafish cardiomyocytes, and the expressions of zebrafish proliferation-related genes such as cdk-2, cdk-6, ccnd1, and ccne1 were significantly down-regulated. Astaxanthin (AST) attenuates PCNB-induced reduction in zebrafish cardiomyocyte proliferation by reducing oxidative stress levels.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the suitability of a contact assay using zebrafish embryo/larvae combined with sub-lethal end-points to evaluate the hazard associated with SS and related HC exposure. A suite of biomarkers was also applied on larvae, related to detoxification and oxidative stress as the activity of Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, glutathione-S-transferase, and catalase, the content of reactive oxygen species and the behavioral assay using the DanioVision™ chamber. Legacy priority pollutants were also measured either in SS and HC tested samples and in contact waters. The exposure to SS caused higher lethality compared to HC. No significant changes in the activity of oxidative stress markers was observed upon exposure to both matrices. The behavioral test showed a hypoactivity condition in larvae exposed to both SS and HC with the effects of SS stronger than HC.

Although several rodent knockout models have demonstrated the importance of SV2A for functional neurotransmission, its precise physiological function and role in epilepsy pathophysiology remains to be elucidated. Here, we present a novel sv2a knockout model in zebrafish, a vertebrate with complementary advantages to rodents. We demonstrated that 6 days post fertilization homozygous sv2a–/– mutant zebrafish larvae, but not sv2a+/– and sv2a+/+ larvae, displayed locomotor hyperactivity and spontaneous epileptiform discharges, however, no major brain malformations could be observed. A partial rescue of this epileptiform brain activity could be observed after treatment with two commonly used anti-epileptic drugs, valproic acid and, surprisingly, levetiracetam. This observation indicated that additional targets, besides Sv2a, maybe are involved in the protective effects of levetiracetam against epileptic seizures. Furthermore, a transcriptome analysis provided insights into the neuropathological processes underlying the observed epileptic phenotype. While gene expression profiling revealed only one differentially expressed gene (DEG) between wildtype and sv2a+/– larvae, there were 4386 and 3535 DEGs between wildtype and sv2a–/–, and sv2a+/– and sv2a–/– larvae, respectively. Pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis between wildtype and sv2a–/– larvae revealed several pathways and GO terms enriched amongst up- and down-regulated genes, including MAPK signaling, synaptic vesicle cycle, and extracellular matrix organization, all known to be involved in epileptogenesis and epilepsy. Importantly, we used the Connectivity map database to identify compounds with opposing gene signatures compared to the one observed in sv2a–/– larvae, to finally rescue the epileptic phenotype. Two out of three selected compounds rescued electrographic discharges in sv2a–/– larvae, while negative controls did not. Taken together, our results demonstrate that sv2a deficiency leads to increased seizure vulnerability and provide valuable insight into the functional importance of sv2a in the brain in general. Furthermore, we provided evidence that the concept of connectivity mapping represents an attractive and powerful approach in the discovery of novel compounds against epilepsy.

The present study aimed to evaluate the harmful consequences due to exposure to antibiotics and NPs, alone and in combination, in the aquatic environment. By exploiting some of their peculiar characteristics, such as small size and ability to bind different types of substances, NPs can carry drugs into the body, showing potential genotoxic effects.

The effects on zebrafish were evaluated in terms of cell viability, DNA fragmentation, and genomic template stability (GTS%) investigated using Trypan blue staining, TUNEL assay, and the random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD PCR) technique, respectively. Our results show that after TiO2 NPs exposure, as well as after TiO2 NPs and lincomycin co-exposure, the percentage of damaged DNA significantly increased and cell viability decreased. On the contrary, exposure to lincomycin alone caused only a GTS% reduction after 14 exposure days.

Despite the increasing use of invertebrates for behavioral phenotyping in toxicological studies and chemical risk assessments, little is known regarding the potential for environmental factors—such as geometry, size, opacity and depth of test chambers—to modulate common behavioral responses. In this work, we demonstrate that test chamber geometry, size, opacity and depth can affect spontaneous, unstimulated behavioral responses of euryhaline crustacean Artemia franciscana first instar larval stages. We found that in the absence of any obvious directional cues, A. franciscana exhibited a strong innate wall preference behavior. Using different test chamber sizes and geometries, we found both increased wall preference and lowered overall distance traveled by the test shrimp in a smaller chamber with sharper-angled vertices. It was also determined through quantifiable changes in the chambers’ color that the A. franciscana early larval stages can perceive, differentiate and react to differences in color or perhaps rather to light transmittance of the test chambers.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neuropathy occur due to kidney failure-induced accumulation of uremic toxins in the body. Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a product of indole metabolism in the liver, is produced from tryptophan by the intestinal flora and is ultimately excreted through the kidneys. Hemodialysis helps renal failure patients eliminate many nephrotoxins, except for IS, which leads to a poor prognosis. Although the impacts of IS on cardiac and renal development have been well documented using mouse and rat models, other model organisms, such as zebrafish, have rarely been studied. The zebrafish genome shares at least 70% similarity with the human genome; therefore, zebrafish are ideal model organisms for studying vertebrate development, including renal development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of IS on the development of zebrafish embryos, especially cardiac and renal development. At 24 h postfertilization (hpf), zebrafish were exposed to IS at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 10 mM. IS reduced survival and the hatching rate, caused cardiac edema, increased mortality, and shortened the body length of zebrafish embryos. In addition, IS decreased heart rates and renal function. IS affected zebrafish development via the ROS and MAPK pathways, which subsequently led to inflammation in the embryos. The results suggest that IS interferes with cardiac and renal development in zebrafish embryos, providing new evidence about the toxicity of IS to aquatic organisms and new insights for the assessment of human health risks. Accordingly, we suggest that zebrafish studies can ideally complement mouse model studies to allow the simultaneous and comprehensive investigation of the physiological impacts of uremic endotheliotoxins, such as IS, on cardiac and renal development. © 2022 by the authors.

Inhibiting NADK is therefore a promising and innovative antibacterial strategy since there is currently no drug on the market targeting this enzyme. Through a fragment-based drug design approach, we have recently developed a NAD+-competitive inhibitor of NADKs, which displayed in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we show that this compound, a di-adenosine derivative, is inactive against the NADK enzyme from the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaNADK). This lack of activity can be explained by the crystal structure of PaNADK, which was determined in complex with NADP+ in this study.

However, the cardiotoxic effects of PFNA and PFBS have not been fully established. We found that PFNA and PFBS exposures repress hatchability while increasing malformation and mortality in zebrafish embryos. Hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as assessment of the transgenic zebrafish line Tg(myl7:nDsRed) revealed that exposure of embryos to PFNA increases the occurrence of severe cardiac malformations relative to exposure to PFBS. Moreover, we evaluated the differential expressions of cardiac development-associated genes in response to PFNA and PFBS, which validated the potential cardiotoxic effects, consistent with cardiac dysfunctions. Overall, our findings reveal novel cardiotoxic effects of PFNA and PFBS in zebrafish, implying that they may exert some cardiotoxic effect in humans.

Results showed that pamiparib can specifically induce cerebral haemorrhage, brain atrophy and movement disorders in fish larvae. In addition, pamiparib exposure leads to downregulation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) activities, and upregulation of oxidative stress which then leads to apoptosis and disrupts the gene expression involved in the neurodevelopment, neurotransmitter pathways and Parkinson’s disease (PD) like symptoms. Meanwhile, astaxanthin can partially rescue neurodevelopmental defects by downregulating oxidative stress. After exposure to pamiparib, the Notch signalling is downregulated, and the use of an activator of Notch signalling can partially rescue neurodevelopmental toxicity.

In this study, caged fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed in situ in a temperate-region effluent-dominated stream (i.e., Muddy Creek) in Coralville, Iowa, USA upstream and downstream of a WWTP effluent outfall. The pharmaceutical composition of Muddy Creek was recently characterized by our team and revealed many compounds there were at a low microgram to high nanogram per liter concentration. Total RNA sequencing analysis on brain tissues revealed 280 gene isoforms that were significantly differentially expressed in male fish and 293 gene isoforms in female fish between the upstream and downstream site. Only 66 (13%) of such gene isoforms overlapped amongst male and female fish, demonstrating sex-dependent impacts on neuronal gene expression. By using a systems biology approach paired with functional enrichment analyses, we identified several potential novel gene biomarkers for treated effluent exposure that could be used to expand monitoring of environmental effects with respect to complex CEC mixtures. Lastly, when comparing the results of this study to those that relied on a single-compound approach, there was relatively little overlap in terms of gene-specific effects.

Understanding the role of phagocytes in killing bacteria is still limited, especially in vivo. In this study, we established a zebrafish model to study the interaction between intravenously administered pneumococci and professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils, to unravel bacterial killing mechanisms employed by these immune cells. Our model confirmed the key role of polysaccharide capsule in promoting pneumococcal virulence through inhibition of phagocytosis. Conversely, we show pneumococci lacking a capsule are rapidly internalised by macrophages. Low doses of encapsulated S. pneumoniae cause near 100% mortality within 48 hours postinfection (hpi), while 50 times higher doses of unencapsulated pneumococci are easily cleared. Time course analysis of in vivo bacterial numbers reveals that while encapsulated pneumococcus proliferates to levels exceeding 105 CFU at the time of host death, unencapsulated bacteria are unable to grow and are cleared within 20 hpi. Using genetically induced macrophage depletion, we confirmed an essential role for macrophages in bacterial clearance. Additionally, we show that upon phagocytosis by macrophages, phagosomes undergo rapid acidification. Genetic and chemical inhibition of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) prevents intracellular bacterial killing and induces host death indicating a key role of phagosomal acidification in immunity to invading pneumococci. We also show that our model can be used to study the efficacy of antimicrobials against pneumococci in vivo. Collectively, our data confirm that larval zebrafish can be used to dissect killing mechanisms during pneumococcal infection in vivo and highlight key roles for phagosomal acidification in macrophages for pathogen clearance. © 2022 Tomasz K.

Its biosafety level is yet to be well established. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the impacts of the nanocarriers on liver cells using the zebra-fish animal model and human liver cell line model (HepG2). Methods: Initially, lethal dose concentration for the norbornene-derived nanocarrier systems in ze-brafish was determined. The toxic effects were analysed at the sub-lethal drug concentration by histopathological study, total GSH level, gene expression, and DNA damage in zebrafish liver cells. Fish erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities were also evaluated. Cell viability and oxidative stress level (ROS generation) after exposure to the nanoconjugates were determined using HepG2 cells in the in vitro study. Results: In vivo studies of both R-CP and RI-CP showed 100% mortality at 96 hours for exposure concentration >100mg/l and showed toxic changes in zebrafish liver histology, GSH, and DNA damage levels. Noticeably upregulated PXR, CYP3A, and cyp2p6 genes were observed in RI-CP exposure than in RIF or R-CP molecules. The in vitro study revealed a dose-dependent effect on cell viability and ROS generation for RIF, R-CP, and RI-CP exposures in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: The current study reports that the rifampicin conjugated (R-CP) and rifampicin-isoni-azid conjugated (RI-CP) norbornene derived nanocarriers exhibit enhanced toxic responses in both adult zebrafish and HepG2 cells. The pH-sensitive norbornene-derived nanocarriers on conjugation with different drugs exhibited varied impacts on hepatic cells.

Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in children. Although intra-arterial chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy have become promising therapeutic approaches for advanced intraocular retinoblastoma, the side effects threaten health and are unavoidable, making the development of targeted therapy an urgent need. Therefore, we intended to find a potential drug for human retinoblastoma by screening an in-house compound library that included 89 purified and well-characterized natural products. METHODS. We screened a panel of 89 natural products in retinoblastoma cell lines to find the inhibitor. The inhibition of the identified inhibitor xanthatin on cell growth was detected through half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), flow cytometry assay, and zebrafish model system. RNA-seq further selected the target gene PLK1. RESULTS. We reported the discovery of xanthatin as an effective inhibitor of retinoblastoma. Mechanistically, xanthatin selectively inhibited the proliferation of retinoblastoma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Interestingly, xanthatin targeted PLK1-mediated cell cycle progression. The efficacy of xanthatin was further confirmed in zebrafish models. CONCLUSIONS.

Finally, E-CBZ and HPPH formation was also assessed in adult zebrafish liver microsomes and compared with those of human, rat, and rabbit. The present study showed teratogenic effects for CBZ and PHE, but not for E-CBZ and HPPH. No HPPH was detected during organogenesis and E-CBZ was only formed at the end of organogenesis. E-CBZ and HPPH formation was also very low-to-negligible in adult zebrafish compared with the mammalian species. As such, other metabolic pathways than those of mammals are involved in the bioactivation of CBZ and PHE, or, these anti-epileptics are teratogens and do not require bioactivation in the zebrafish. © 2021 by the authors.

Following the emergence of a new generation of molecular biological technologies such as reverse and forward genetics, morpholino, transgenesis, and gene knockout, many human neurodegenerative disease models, such as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Alzheimer’s, were con-structed in zebrafish and medaka. These studies proved that zebrafish and medaka genes are func-tionally conserved in relation to their human homologues, so they exhibit similar neurodegenerative phenotypes to human beings.

We then describe two protocols to systematically test how key experimental parameters, including genetic background, culture media, animal density, volume, plate material, and developmental stage in which the embryos are exposed, alter the MTC and LC50. Finally, we provide a step-by-step guide to assess the interaction between two chemicals using this model.

The novelty is also related to its targeted antioxidant potential in vitro and in vivo. The main aims were to: (a) identify and compare VOCs of FrCa and DrCa obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and hydrodistillation (HD); (b) determine fatty acid (FA) composition of freeze-dried sample (FdCa); (c) determine the composition of less polar fractions of FdCa by high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry with electrospray ionisation (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS); and (d) comprehensively evaluate the antioxidant activity of the fractions by four in vitro assays and in vivo zebrafish model (including embryotoxicity). Significant changes of VOCs were found after air drying. ω6 FAs were present in higher content than ω3 FAs indicating C. adhaerens as a good source of dietary polyunsaturated FAs.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of how well the presence or absence of exposure-related findings in the ZET predicts prenatal development toxicity in studies with rats and rabbits. A two-Tiered systematic review of the developmental toxicity literature was performed, a review of the ZET literature was followed by one of the mammalian literature. Data were extracted using DistillerSR, and study validity was assessed with an amended SYRCLE's risk-of-bias tool. Extracted data were analyzed for each species and substance, which provided the basis for comparing the 2 test methods. Although limited by the number of 24 included chemicals, our results suggest that the ZET has potential to identify chemicals that are mammalian prenatal developmental toxicants, with a tendency for overprediction. Furthermore, our analysis confirmed the need for further standardization of the ZET. In addition, we identified contextual and methodological challenges in the application of systematic review approaches to toxicological questions. One key to overcoming these challenges is a transition to more comprehensive and transparent planning, conduct and reporting of toxicological studies.

Several modification methods, including silica coating, core-shell structure development, and organic molecular camouflage were applied to reduce the toxicity of the materials, whereby the polyethylene glycol (PEG) camouflage method exhibited better performance for improving the biocompatibility of CdSe QDs, which could effectively reduce ROS and apoptosis induced by CdSe QDs in the zebrafish model. Meanwhile, we employed a series of genetically modified zebrafish models to assess the CdSe QDs toxicity, and the polyethylene glycol (PEG) camouflage showed protective effects in the heart, nerves, blood vessels, and immune system. CdSe QDs disguised by PEG could effectively alleviate the toxicity of CdSe QDs in multiple organs. In summary, our data revealed that CdSe QDs induced an excessive production of ROS, which would activate the apoptosis pathway mediated by p53 and caspase-3 and resulted in cardiovascular system, nervous system, and immune system toxicity. PEG camouflage could effectively decrease ROS generation and apoptosis to improve the biocompatibility of CdSe QDs.

The therapeutic targeting of IBD has been hampered by the complex causality of the disease, with environmental insults like cholesterol-enriched Western diets playing a critical role. To address this drug development challenge, we report an easy-to-handle dietary cholesterol-based in vivo assay that allows the screening of immune-modulatory therapeutics in transgenic zebrafish models. An improvement in the feeding strategy with high cholesterol diet (HCD) selectively induces a robust and consistent infiltration of myeloid cells in larvae intestines that is highly suitable for compound discovery efforts. Using transgenics with fluorescent reporter expression in neutrophils, we take advantage of the unique zebrafish larvae clarity to monitor an acute inflammatory response in a whole organism context with a fully functional innate immune system. The use of semi-automated image acquisition and processing combined with quantitative image analysis allows categorizing anti- or pro-inflammatory compounds based on a leukocytic inflammation index. Our HCD gut inflammation (HCD-GI) assay is simple, cost- and time-effective as well as highly physiological which makes it unique when compared to chemical-based zebrafish models of IBD. Besides, diet is a highly controlled, selective and targeted trigger of intestinal inflammation that avoids extra-intestinal outcomes and reduces the chances of chemical-induced toxicity during screenings. We show the validity of this assay for a screening platform by testing two dietary phenolic acids, namely gallic acid (GA; 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) and ferulic acid (FA; 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid), with well described anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of IBD. Analysis of common IBD therapeutics (Prednisolone and Mesalamine) proved the fidelity of our IBD-like intestinal inflammation model. In conclusion, the HCD-GI assay can facilitate and accelerate drug discovery efforts on IBD, by identification of novel lead molecules with immune modulatory action on intestinal neutrophilic inflammation. This will serve as a jumping-off point for more profound analyses of drug mechanisms and pathways involved in early IBD immune responses. © Copyright © 2021 Silva, Carregosa, Gonçalves, Vieira, Nunes dos Santos, Jacinto and Crespo.","","10.3389/fcell.2021.674749","Cholesterol, Dietary;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Inflammation",NA,NA

To address this, we tested compounds for neuroprotective effects in multiple zebrafish and mouse RP models, reasoning drugs effective across species and/or independent of disease mutation may translate better clinically. We first performed a large-scale phenotypic drug screen for compounds promoting rod cell survival in a larval zebrafish model of inducible RP. We tested 2,934 compounds, mostly human-approved drugs, across six concentrations, resulting in 113 compounds being identified as hits. Secondary tests of 42 high-priority hits confirmed eleven lead candidates. Leads were then evaluated in a series of mouse RP models in an effort to identify compounds effective across species and RP models, i.e., potential pan-disease therapeutics. Nine of eleven leads exhibited neuroprotective effects in mouse primary photoreceptor cultures, and three promoted photoreceptor survival in mouse rd1 retinal explants. Both shared and complementary mechanisms of action were implicated across leads. Shared target tests implicated parp1-dependent cell death in our zebrafish RP model. Complementation tests revealed enhanced and additive/synergistic neuroprotective effects of paired drug combinations in mouse photoreceptor cultures and zebrafish, respectively. These results highlight the value of cross-species/multi-model phenotypic drug discovery and suggest combinatorial drug therapies may provide enhanced therapeutic benefits for RP patients. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

The vision alteration primarily begins with rod photoreceptor degeneration, then the degenerative process continues with cone photoreceptor death. Variants in 71 genes have been linked to RP. One of these genes, PDE6a is responsible for RP43. To date no treatment is available and patients suffer from pronounced visual impairment in early childhood. We used the novel zebrafish pde6aQ70X mutant, generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea at the European Zebrafish Resource Centre, to better understand how PDE6a loss of function leads to photoreceptor alteration. Interestingly, zebrafish pde6aQ70X mutants exhibited impaired visual function at 5 dpf as evidenced by the decrease in their visual motor response (VMR) compared to pde6aWT larvae. This impaired visual function progressed with time and was more severe at 21 dpf. These modifications were associated with an alteration of rod outer segment length at 5 and 21 dpf. In summary, these findings suggest that rod outer segment shrinkage due to Pde6a deficiency begins very early in zebrafish, progresses with time.

In this study, we tested the minimum safe concentration of gallic acid (GA) in 72 hpf zebrafish larvae in order to evaluate the effects on the central nervous system and the behavioral response. We showed that a short exposure (30 min) induces the depletion of the two main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, Glu and GABA, respectively, in the larval nervous system. The acute impairment of GABAergic-glutamatergic balance was paralleled by an increase of the fosab neuronal activity marker in specific brain areas, such as the forebrain, olfactory bulbs, pallial area, ventral midbrain, tegmentum, and the medulla oblongata ventral area. The neuronal excitation was mirrored by the increased cumulative motor response. The inhibition of the olfactory epithelium with brief cadmium exposition suggests a direct involvement of olfaction in the larvae response to GA. Our results demonstrate that a brief exposure to GA induces motoneuronal hyperexcitability in zebrafish. The behavioral response was probably elicited through the activation of an odorous, or chemical, stimulus. The specificity of the activated neuronal territories suggests the involvement of additional signaling pathways. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated, our data support the hypothesis that GA acts as an excitatory molecule, capable of inducing a specific nerve response.

Due to increased resistance to antibiotics, new therapeutic strategies against P. aeruginosa are urgently needed. In this context, we aimed to develop a simple vertebrate animal model to rapidly assess in vivo drug efficacy against P. aeruginosa. Zebrafish are increasingly considered for modeling human infections caused by bacterial pathogens, which are commonly microinjected in embryos. In the present study, we established a novel protocol for zebrafish infection by P. aeruginosa based on bath immersion in 96-well plates of tail-injured embryos. The immersion method, followed by a 48-hour survey of embryo viability, was first validated to assess the virulence of P. aeruginosa wild-type PAO1 and a known attenuated mutant. We then validated its relevance for antipseudomonal drug testing by first using a clinically used antibiotic, ciprofloxacin. Secondly, we used a novel quorum sensing (QS) inhibitory molecule, N-(2-pyrimidyl)butanamide (C11), the activity of which had been validated in vitro but not previously tested in any animal model. A significant protective effect of C11 was observed on infected embryos, supporting the ability of C11 to attenuate in vivo P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. In conclusion, we present here a new and reliable method to compare the virulence of P. aeruginosa strains in vivo and to rapidly assess the efficacy of clinically relevant drugs against P. aeruginosa, including new antivirulence compounds. © 2021 by the authors.","","10.3390/pathogens10040401","Pseudomonas aeruginosa",NA,NA

Traditionally, 1 cell type is used for TPP studies, with the risk of missing important differentially expressed target proteins. The use of whole organisms would circumvent this problem. Zebrafish embryos are amenable to such an approach. Here, we used TPP on whole zebrafish embryo lysate to identify protein targets of napabucasin, a compound that may affect signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling through an ill-understood mechanism. In zebrafish embryos, napabucasin induced developmental defects consistent with inhibition of Stat3 signaling. TPP profiling showed no distinct shift in Stat3 upon napabucasin treatment, but effects were detected on the oxidoreductase, Pora, which might explain effects on Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, thermal stability of several aldehyde dehydrogenases was affected. Moreover, napabucasin activated aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymatic activity in vitro. Aldehyde dehydrogenases have crucial roles in retinoic acid metabolism, and functionally, we validated napabucasin-mediated activation of the retinoic acid pathway in zebrafish in vivo. We conclude that TPP profiling in whole zebrafish embryo lysate is feasible and facilitates direct correlation of in vivo effects of small molecule drugs with their protein targets. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.","","10.1074/MCP.RA120.002273","Proteomics;Proteome",33594990,NA

Cobalamin deficiency may be especially acute for rapidly divid-ing cells, such as glioblastoma cells. Therefore, cobalamin antagonists offer a medicinal potential for developing anti-glioma agents. In the present study, we developed an in vitro model of cobalamin deficiency in glioblastoma cells. Long-term treatment of cells with the cobalamin analogue, hydroxycobalamin [c-lactam] (HCCL) was applied to induce an increase of hypocobalaminemia biomarker. Cytometric assays demonstrated that vitamin B12 promoted glioblastoma cells proliferation, whereas the treatment of cells with HCCL caused a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation and an induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Vitamin B12 counteracted all the observed effects of HCCL. In the in silico study, we characterized the molecular interactions between HCCL and transcobalamin II (TCII). We have demonstrated that HCCL shares similar interactions with TCII as naturally occurring cobalamins and therefore may act as a competitive inhibitor of this key transporter protein. We assessed the impact of HCCL on the mortality or developmental malformations of zebrafish em-bryos. Collectively, our findings suggest that the use of cobalamin transport antagonists as potential anti-glioma agents would be worth exploring further. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of four PFAAs as a function of chain length and head group (carboxylate versus sulfonate) with in vitro and in vivo zebrafish assessments, which were subsequently compared to other cell and aquatic models. Mortality rate increased with chain length (PFOA > PFHxA ≫ PFBA) in both whole embryo/larvae and embryonic cell models. The sulfonate group enhanced toxicity with perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) showing higher toxicity than PFBA and PFHxA in both larvae and cells. Toxicity trends were similar among different aquatic models, but sensitivities varied. Discrepancies with other zebrafish studies were confirmed to be associated with a lack of neutralization of acidic pH of dosing solutions in these other investigations, demonstrating the need for rigor in reporting pH of exposure solutions in all experiments. The zebrafish embryonic cell line was also found to be similar to most other cell lines regardless of exposure length. Overall, results agree with findings in other cell lines and organisms where longer chain length and sulfonate group increase toxicity, except in investigations not neutralizing the exposure solutions for these acidic compounds. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","","10.1080/15287394.2020.1842272","",33143551,NA

METHODS: Healthy zebrafish embryos 1 d post fertilization (1 dpf) were exposed to different concentrations of psoralen (PS), isopsoralen (IPS), psoralenoside (PSS) and isopsoralenoside (IPSS). Death numbers of the embryos or larvals were counted from 1 to 5 d after dosing(2-6 dpf); embryonic micro-morphology of zebrafish (3 dpf or 3-6 dpf) was observed and pictures were taken; LC50 value of 6 dpf zebrafish was calculated by SPSS16.0. In addition, a relatively safe concentration of each sample was exposed to 1-6 dpf zebrafish as above and sampled every day to analyze the dynamic metabolites changes. RESULTS: Psoralen and isopsoralen original form caused 3 dpf zebrafish poisoning; while psoralenoside and isopsoralenoside were mainly in original form when zebrafish was 3 dpf, and no obvious morphology changes were observed. But they were transformed by 4-6 dpf zebrafish into psoralen and isopsoralen, respectively, and caused zebrafish poisoning. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of psoralenoside and isopsoralenoside to zebrafish is closely related to the transformation in zebrafish. Psoralen and isopsoralen are not only the original components in Psoralea corylifolia L., but also the metabolic components converted in the body. They are components related to toxicity. The zebrafish toxicity-metabolism correlation method can efficiently identify the in vivo toxicity of micro-components and their correlation with metabolic transformation.

It causes severe problems regarding eating and speaking and requires long-term treatment. Effective prenatal treatment would contribute to reducing the risk of cleft palate. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is critically involved in palatogenesis, and genetic or chemical disturbance of this signaling pathway leads to cleft palate. Presently, preventative treatment for cleft palate during prenatal development has limited efficacy, but we expect that zebrafish will provide a useful high-throughput chemical screening model for effective prevention. To achieve this, the zebrafish model should recapitulate cleft palate development and its rescue by chemical modulation of the Wnt pathway. Here, we provide proof of concept for a zebrafish chemical screening model. Zebrafish embryos were treated with 12 chemical reagents known to induce cleft palate in mammals, and all 12 chemicals induced cleft palate characterized by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of palatal cells. The cleft phenotype was enhanced by combinatorial treatment with Wnt inhibitor and teratogens. Furthermore, the expression of tcf7 and lef1 as a readout of the pathway was decreased. Conversely, cleft palate was prevented by Wnt agonist and the cellular defects were also prevented. In conclusion, we provide evidence that chemical-induced cleft palate is caused by inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway. Our results indicate that this zebrafish model is promising for chemical screening for prevention of cleft palate as well as modulation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target. © Copyright © 2020 Narumi, Liu, Ikeda, Morita and Tasaki.","","10.3389/fcell.2020.592967","Signal Transduction;Palate",NA,NA

The zebrafish larva is an attractive disease model in tuberculosis research. To translate pharmacological findings to higher vertebrates, including humans, the internal exposure of drugs needs to be quantified and linked to observed response. Experimental Approach: In zebrafish studies, drugs are usually dissolved in the external water, posing a challenge to quantify internal exposure. We developed experimental methods to quantify internal exposure, including nanoscale blood sampling, and to quantify the bacterial burden, using automated fluorescence imaging analysis, with isoniazid as the test compound. We used pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling to quantify the exposure–response relationship responsible for the antibiotic response. To translate isoniazid response to humans, quantitative exposure–response relationships in zebrafish were linked to simulated concentration–time profiles in humans, and two quantitative translational factors on sensitivity to isoniazid and stage of infection were included. Key Results: Blood concentration was only 20% of the external drug concentration. The bacterial burden increased exponentially, and an isoniazid dose corresponding to 15 mg·L−1internal concentration (minimum inhibitory concentration) leads to bacteriostasis of the mycobacterial infection in the zebrafish. The concentration–effect relationship was quantified, and based on that relationship and the translational factors, the isoniazid response was translated to humans, which correlated well with observed data. Conclusions and Implications: This proof of concept study confirmed the potential of zebrafish larvae as tuberculosis disease models in translational pharmacology and contributes to innovative anti-tuberculosis drug development, which is very clearly needed. © 2020 The Authors.

It has been estimated that 5–10% of the anthropogenic chemicals are developmental neurotoxic (DNT) and exposure to DNT compounds has been linked to several neurological diseases.

Digital film recording with subsequent analysis of video sequences using specialised animal tracking software has become a standard in obtaining behavioral biometric data. At present animal tracking algorithms are largely capable of detecting and tracking small number of animals and extracting quantitative endpoints associated with specific behavioral traits based on reconstruction of movement trajectories and occupancy heatmaps. However, despite recent and significant progress in development of diverse proxy biological models, the software algorithms still lack the ability to track multiple organisms on a large scale, automatically generate behavioral fingerprints and utilize intensive computational approaches to mine rich biometric data.

We first demonstrated that, whatever type of extraction is used, both extracts displayed significant antioxidant properties and acid phenolic and flavonoid contents. By using selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we performed polyphenol identification and quantification.

Following embryonic zebrafish exposure to BPA (0.1, 1 and 4 mg/L) and EE2 (10 ng/L) from 2 to 5 dpf, we assessed the metabolic phenotype in larvae (4–6 dpf) and juveniles (43–49 dpf) which had been divided into regular-fed and overfed groups at 29 dpf. Developmental BPA exposure in larvae dose-dependently reduced food-intake and locomotion and increased energy expenditure. Juveniles (29 dpf) exhibited a transient increase in body weight after developmental BPA exposure and persistent diet-dependent locomotion changes (43–49 dpf). At the molecular level, glucose and lipid metabolism-related transcript abundance clearly separated BPA exposed fish from controls and EE2 exposed fish at the larval stage, in juveniles on a regular diet and, to a lesser extent, in overfed juveniles. In general, the metabolic endpoints affected by BPA exposure were not mimicked by EE2 treatment.

In this study to further investigate the relationship between heavy-metal exposure and de novo copy number alterations (CNAs), zebrafish fibroblast cells were exposed to the neurotoxicant lead (Pb). A crystal violet assay was first used to determine exposure concentrations with >80% cell confluency. Then a zebrafish-specific array comparative genomic hybridization platform was used to detect CNAs following a 72 h Pb exposure (0.24, 2.4, or 24 μM). The Pb exposure resulted in 72 CNA amplifications ranging in size from 5 to 329 kb. No deletions were detected. CNAs resulted in 15 CNA regions (CNARs), leaving 7 singlet CNAs. Two of the singlets were within high repeat genomic locations. The number of CNAs tended to increase in a concentration-dependent manner. Several CNARs encompassed genes previously reported to have altered expression with Pb exposure, suggesting a mechanistic link. In addition, almost all genes are associated within a molecular network with amyloid precursor protein, a key molecular target associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

In the present study, we employed zebrafish embryos to study the developmental toxicity effect of ISL and its underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish embryos upon treatment with either vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) or ISL solutions for 4–96 h post fertilization (hpf) showed that ISL exposure instigated severe developmental toxicity in heart, liver, and nervous system. Mortality and morphological abnormalities were also observed. High concentrations of ISL exposure resulted in abnormal phenotypes and embryonic malformations including pericardial edema, swim bladder defects, yolk retention, curved body shape and shortening of body length. Moreover, ISL exposure led to significant loss of dopaminergic neurons accompanied by reduced locomotor behaviour. Apoptotic cells were predominantly located in the heart area of 96 hpf embryo. Additionally, ISL significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation content and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities.

Pharmaceuticals in the parts-per-billion range can impact fish behavior, survival, and recruitment in the wild. However, the ecological risk posed by whole municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), a complex mixture, is not clear. This knowledge gap is particularly evident for early lifestages (ELS) of fish, and because effluent discharge events are typically short, the effects of short-term MWWE exposures to ELS fish are particularly important from an environmental perspective. Here we tested the effects of rapid 30-min exposures, and short-term 24- and 72-h exposures to MWWE on development, behaviors, and stress response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, larvae, and juveniles. We obtained 24-h composite samples of tertiary-treated MWWE that contained a mixture of chemicals with affinities for serotonergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and ion-channel receptors. Embryos exposed to 5%, 10%, and 50% MWWE experienced developmental delays in somitogenesis and hatching rate, although there was no effect on survival. Embryonic photomotor responses were affected following 30-min and 24-h exposures to 10% and 50% MWWE, and larval visual motor responses were reduced from 24-h exposure to 10% MWWE. Exposure to 10% MWWE dulled the juvenile cortisol and lactate response following an acute air-exposure. Compromised behavioral and stress performances demonstrate the capacity of MWWE to impact phenotypes critical to the survival of fish in the environment. Taken together, we found that zebrafish were sensitive to toxic effects of MWWE at multiple life-stages. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","","10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113757","",31896476,NA

The ability of early Pb2+ exposure to induce epigenetic changes is well-established, suggesting that Pb2+-induced neurobehavioral deficits may be heritable across generations. Understanding the long-term and multigenerational repercussions of lead exposure is crucial for clarifying both the genotypic alterations behind these behavioral outcomes and the potential mechanism of heritability. To study this, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (&lt;2 h post fertilization; EK strain) were exposed for 24 h to waterborne Pb2+ at a concentration of 10 μM. This exposed F0 generation was raised to adulthood and spawned to produce the F1 generation, which was subsequently spawned to produce the F2 generation. Previous avoidance conditioning studies determined that a 10 μM Pb2+ dose resulted in learning impairments persisting through the F2 generation. RNA was extracted from control- and 10 μM Pb2+-lineage F2 brains, (n = 10 for each group), sequenced, and transcript expression was quantified utilizing Quant-Seq. 648 genes were differentially expressed in the brains of F2 lead-lineage fish versus F2 control-lineage fish. Pathway analysis revealed altered genes in processes including synaptic function and plasticity, neurogenesis, endocrine homeostasis, and epigenetic modification, all of which are implicated in lead-induced neurobehavioral deficits and/or their inheritance.

However, there is increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of tissue-resident macrophages, leading to a pressing need for new tools to discriminate mononuclear phagocytic system subsets from other hematopoietic lineages. Macrophage-expressed gene (Mpeg)1.1 is an evolutionary conserved gene encoding perforin-2, a pore-forming protein associated with host defense against pathogens. Zebrafish mpeg1.1:GFP and mpeg1.1:mCherry reporters were originally established to specifically label macrophages. Since then more than 100 peer-reviewed publications have made use of mpeg1.1-driven transgenics for in vivo studies, providing new insights into key aspects of macrophage ontogeny, activation, and function. Whereas the macrophage-specific expression pattern of the mpeg1.1 promoter has been firmly established in the zebrafish embryo, it is currently not known whether this specificity is maintained through adulthood. Here we report direct evidence that beside macrophages, a subpopulation of B-lymphocytes is marked by mpeg1.1 reporters in most adult zebrafish organs. These mpeg1.1+ lymphoid cells endogenously express mpeg1.1 and can be separated from mpeg1.1+ macrophages by virtue of their light-scatter characteristics using FACS. Remarkably, our analyses also revealed that B-lymphocytes, rather than mononuclear phagocytes, constitute the main mpeg1.1-positive population in irf8null myeloid-defective mutants, which were previously reported to recover tissue-resident macrophages in adulthood. One notable exception is skin macrophages, whose development and maintenance appear to be independent from irf8, similar to mammals. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that irf8 functions in myelopoiesis are evolutionary conserved and highlight the need for alternative macrophage-specific markers to study the mononuclear phagocytic system in adult zebrafish. © 2020 The Authors.

Existing therapies for PD are only symptomatic, and their efficacy decreases as disease progresses. Zebrafish, a vertebrate in which parkinsonism has been modelled, offers unique features for the identification of molecules with antiparkinsonian properties. Here, we developed a screening assay for the selection of neuroactive agents with antiparkinsonian potential. First, we performed a pharmacological validation of the phenotypes exhibited by the 6-hydroxydopamine zebrafish model, by testing the effects of known antiparkinsonian agents. These drugs were also tested for disease-modifying properties by whole mount immunohistochemistry to TH+ neurons and confocal microscopy in the dopaminergic diencephalic cluster of zebrafish. Next, we optimized a phenotypic screening using the 6-hydroxydopamine zebrafish model and tested 1600 FDA-approved bioactive drugs. We found that 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned zebrafish larvae exhibit bradykinetic and dyskinetic-like behaviours that are rescued by the administration of levodopa, rasagiline, isradipine or amantadine. The rescue of dopaminergic cell loss by isradipine was also verified, through the observation of a higher number of TH+ neurons in 6-OHDA-lesioned zebrafish larvae treated with this compound as compared to untreated lesioned larvae. The phenotypic screening enabled us to identify several compounds previously positioned for PD, as well as, new molecules with potential antiparkinsonian properties. Among these, we selected stavudine, tapentadol and nabumetone as the most promising candidates.

Nano-toxicology is an innovative area of toxicological study that assesses the toxicological assets of NPs to decide whether they constitute a risk or an ecological problem and to what degree. To assess the different NPs toxicity, numerous nanotoxicological studies were piloted using different methods. The vital mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity were recently studied especially in aquatic wildlife. In recent years, nanoparticle toxicity evaluation amplified exponentially by using zebrafish as an animal prototypical system. Zebrafish has been tested as an established model system for experimental biological study and are evolving as a solid nanotoxicity prototype which is progressively used as an in vivo model. It is principally used as a platform for rapid testing and assortment of molecules in the object or phenotype techniques. It offers a number of advantages over other living prototypes by offering prospects to speedily screen nanoparticulate medicines beneath in-vivo environments, also an economical way to link the present gap among in vitro and vertebrate studies. Many researchers have summarized experimental parameters critically used by zebrafish as an animal model for biomedical tests such as sample size, organ, and type wild against transgenic lines.

However, more than a decade after the first report on MACS, there is a very limited number of groups who have continued to develop the technique, let alone it being widely adopted by practitioners.

Here, using paracetamol as paradigm compound, mathematical modelling is used to quantify absorption and elimination rates from internal exposure over time profiles after waterborne treatment, as well as changes in these parameters in post-hatching larvae of 3, 4, and 5 days post fertilisation (dpf).

Several small-molecule CDK8/19 inhibitors showed in vivo efficacy and two have entered clinical trials, with no significant toxicities reported. However, Clarke et al. (eLife 2016; 5; e20722) found severe systemic toxicity associated with two potent CDK8/19 inhibitors, Cmpd3 (CCT251921) and Cmpd4 (MSC2530818), and suggested that their toxicity was due to on-target effects. Here, we compared five CDK8/19 inhibitors: Cmpd3, Cmpd4, Senexin B, 16-didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) and 15w, in different assays. Only Cmpd4 showed striking toxicity in developing zebrafish. In cell-based assays for CDK8 and CDK19 inhibition, Cmpd3, Cmpd4, dCA and 15w showed similar low-nanomolar potency and efficacy against CDK8 and CDK19, while Senexin B was less potent. Only dCA produced sustained inhibition of CDK8/19-dependent gene expression. While toxicity of different compounds did not correlate with their effects on CDK8 and CDK19, kinome profiling identified several off-target kinases for both Cmpd3 and Cmpd4, which could be responsible for their toxicity. Off-target activities could have been achieved in the study of Clarke et al. due to high in vivo doses of Cmpd3 and Cmpd4, chosen for the ability to inhibit STAT1 S727 phosphorylation in tumor xenografts. We show here that STAT1 S727 phosphorylation is induced by various cytokines and stress stimuli in CDK8/19-independent manner, indicating that it is not a reliable pharmacodynamic marker of CDK8/19 activity. These results illustrate the need for careful off-target analysis and dose selection in the development of CDK8/19 inhibitors. © 2019 by the authors.

Formulation design and optimization are therefore key steps towards successful nanomedicine development. Unfortunately, detailed assessment of nanomedicine formulations, at a macromolecular level, in rodents is severely limited by the restricted imaging possibilities within these animals. Moreover, rodent in vivo studies are time consuming and expensive, limiting the number of formulations that can be practically assessed in any one study. Consequently, screening and optimisation of nanomedicine formulations is most commonly performed in surrogate biological model systems, such as human-derived cell cultures. However, despite the time and cost advantages of classical in vitro models, these artificial systems fail to reflect and mimic the complex biological situation a nanomedicine will encounter in vivo. This has acutely hampered the selection of potentially successful nanomedicines for subsequent rodent in vivo studies. Recently, zebrafish have emerged as a promising in vivo model, within nanomedicine development pipelines, by offering opportunities to quickly screen nanomedicines under in vivo conditions and in a cost-effective manner so as to bridge the current gap between in vitro and rodent studies. In this review, we outline several advantageous features of the zebrafish model, such as biological conservation, imaging modalities, availability of genetic tools and disease models, as well as their various applications in nanomedicine development.

Contrary to conventional views of antimicrobial tolerance, disruption was more pronounced for slow-growing, aggregated bacteria than for fast-growing, planktonic species. Live imaging revealed that antibiotic treatment promoted bacterial aggregation and increased susceptibility to intestinal expulsion. Intestinal mechanics therefore amplify the effects of antibiotics on resident bacteria.

The purified compounds were tested in zebrafish embryos, as well as in vitro for cholinesterase inhibition activities. Compound 12 produced defects in myotome structure (metameric muscle, which is critical for locomotion) in vivo and showed the most potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 191 nM in vitro. The phenotype assay was also used to reveal bioactivities for several previously reported arisugacins, which had failed to show activity in prior cell-based and in vitro testing.

Local TH action is monitored at three distinct levels by different types of regulators: transmembrane transporters (TH influx and efflux), deiodinases (TH activation and inactivation) and nuclear receptors (TH signalling). Since TH regulators are strongly conserved among vertebrate species, the externally and rapidly developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become one of the favourite models to study their role in TH-dependent development. Most regulators are expressed in zebrafish from early stages in development in a dynamic and tissue-specific pattern. Transient or permanent disruption of a given regulator severely perturbs development of multiple organs. These zebrafish deficiency models help to explain why, next to overall hypo-/hyperthyroidism, inactivating mutations in the genes encoding TH regulators such as MCT8 and THRA/B have irreversible adverse effects on human development. Zebrafish are also increasingly used as a high-throughput model to assess the toxicity of various xenobiotics and their impact on development. While adverse effects on TH metabolism and gene expression have been shown, information on direct interaction with TH regulators is scarce, albeit essential to fully understand their mechanism of action. For the future, the combination of novel gene silencing tools, fluorescent reporter lines and (single-cell) transcriptomics holds promise for new zebrafish models to further elucidate the role of each TH regulator in vertebrate development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","","10.1016/j.ygcen.2018.09.011","Thyroid Gland",30244055,NA

Zebrafish assays can be used not only to screen libraries of compounds at the earliest stages but also to evaluate advanced leads for their effects on specific biological pathways or for toxicity. However, when confronted with inactivity of a compound in a zebrafish assay, there are little data that can be used to judge if the compound is truly biologically inert or inactive due to a lack of permeability into the model organism. While medicinal chemistry principles suggest parameters that are predictive of human oral bioavailability, cellular permeability, and even bacterial permeability, there have been no such parameters developed for zebrafish absorption. To address this question, we compiled a set of 700 compounds reported in the literature to be active in zebrafish assays, evaluated their properties, and compared them to properties derived from a set of historical drugs and a set of recently approved oral drugs. While some properties overlap, the averages and 10th and 90th percentiles of molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient (logP), H-bond counts, and polar surface area for zebrafish-active compounds are statistically different from those of known drugs.

Here, we assessed the role of CB2 in selected swimming behaviors in zebrafish larvae and developed an in vivo upscalable whole-organism approach for CB2 ligand screening. Experimental Approach: Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generated a novel null allele (cnr2upr1) and a stable homozygote-viable loss-of-function (CB2-KO) line. We measured in untreated wild-Type and cnr2upr1/upr1 larvae, photo-dependent (swimming) responses (PDR) and center occupancy (CO) to establish quantifiable anxiety-like parameters. Next, we measured PDR alteration and CO variation while exposing wild-Type and mutant animals to an anxiolytic drug (valproic acid [VPA]) or to an anxiogenic drug (pentylenetetrazol [PTZ]). Finally, we treated wild-Type and mutant larvae with two CB2-specific agonists (JWH-133 and HU-308) and two CB2-specific antagonists, inverse agonists (AM-630 and SR-144528). Results: Untreated CB2-KO showed a different PDR than wild-Type larvae as well as a decreased CO. VPA treatments diminished swimming activity in all animals but to a lesser extend in mutants. CO was strongly diminished and even more in mutants. PTZ-induced inverted PDR was significantly stronger in light and weaker in dark periods and the CO lower in PTZ-Treated mutants. Finally, two of four tested CB2 ligands had a detectable activity in the assay. Conclusions: We showed that larvae lacking CB2 behave differently in complex behaviors that can be assimilated to anxiety-like behaviors. Mutant larvae responded differently to VPA and PTZ treatments, providing in vivo evidence of CB2 modulating complex behaviors. We also established an upscalable combined genetic/behavioral approach in a whole organism that could be further developed for high-Throughput drug discovery platforms. © Agnes Acevedo-Canabal et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2019.","","10.1089/can.2018.0025","Cannabinoids;Receptors, Cannabinoid",31236475,NA

The rationale for the use of this model is highlighted and the initial efforts in the fields of disease modeling and high-throughput screening are illustrated. Finally, the advantages and limitations of in vivo zebrafish screening are discussed, highlighting newer approaches, such as genome editing technologies, to accelerate our understanding of disease biology and the development of precise disease models. Expert opinion: Full understanding and faithful modeling of specific cardiovascular disease is a rate-limiting step for cardiovascular drug discovery. The resurgence of in vivo phenotype screening together with the advancement of systems biology approaches allows for the identification of lead compounds which show efficacy on integrative disease biology in the absence of validated targets.

One interaction that has been recently identified occurs between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor (NRF) family. Each transcription factor regulates numerous downstream genes involved in the cellular response to toxicants and oxidative stress; they are also implicated in normal developmental pathways. The zebrafish model was used to explore the role of AHR regulation of nrf genes during development and in response to toxicant exposure. To determine if AHR1b is responsible for transcriptional regulation of 6 nrf genes during development, a loss-of-function experiment using morpholino-modified oligonucleotides was conducted followed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation study at the beginning of the pharyngula period (24 h postfertilization). The expression of nrf1a was AHR1b dependent and its expression was directly regulated through specific XREs in its cis-promoter. However, nrf1a expression was not altered by exposure to 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a toxicant and prototypic AHR agonist. The expression of nrf1b, nrf2a, and nfe2 was induced by TCDD, and AHR1b directly regulated their expression by binding to cis-XRE promoter elements. Last, nrf2b and nrf3 were neither induced by TCDD nor regulated by AHR1b. These results show that AHR1b transcriptionally regulates nrf genes under toxicant modulation via binding to specific XREs. These data provide a better understanding of how combinatorial molecular signaling potentially protects embryos from embryotoxic events following toxicant exposure. © The Author(s) 2018.

We screened 640 FDA-approved compounds currently in clinical use for other conditions to identify those which disrupt development of NCSC-derived skeletal elements that form the zebrafish jaw. In the primary screen, we used heterozygous transgenic sox10:gfp zebrafish to directly visualise NCSC-derived jaw cartilage. We noted partial toxicity of this transgene in relation to jaw patterning, suggesting that our primary screen was sensitised for NCSC defects, and we confirmed 10 novel, 4 previously reported, and 2 functional analogue drug hits in wild-type embryos.

Of the 13 associated genes, mutations in NEBULIN (NEB) accounts for up to 50% of all cases. Currently, the disease is incompletely understood and there are no available therapeutics for patients. To address this urgent need for effective treatments for patients affected by NM, we conducted a large scale chemical screen in a zebrafish model of NEB-related NM and an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based genetic screen in a mouse model of NEB exon 55 deletion, the most common NEB mutation in NM patients.

Many, if not most, neuropsychiatric disorders in humans are either associated with underlying social deficits or are accompanied by social dysfunctions. Traditionally, rodent models have been used to model these behavioral impairments. However, rodent assays are often difficult to scale up and adapt to high-throughput formats, which severely limits their use for systems-level science. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have used zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system to study social behavior. These studies have demonstrated clear potential in overcoming some of the limitations of rodent models.

However, forward chemical screens in zebrafish can be time consuming and usually &gt;99% of test compounds have no significant effect on the desired phenotype. Here, we sought to find bioactive drugs more efficiently and to comply with the 3R principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement of animals in research. We investigated if pooling of drugs to simultaneously test 8-10 compounds in zebrafish larvae can increase the screening efficiency of an established assay that identifies drugs inhibiting developmental angiogenesis in the eye. In a phenotype-based screen, we tested 1,760 small molecule compounds from the ChemBridge DIVERSetTM chemical library for their ability to inhibit the formation of distinct primary hyaloid vessels in the eye. Applying orthogonal pooling of the chemical library, we treated zebrafish embryos from 3 to 5 days post fertilization with pools of 8 or 10 compounds at 10 μM each. This reduced the number of tests from 1,760 to 396. In 63% of cases, treatment showed sub-threshold effects of &lt;40% reduction of primary hyaloid vessels. From 18 pool hits, we identified eight compounds that reduce hyaloid vessels in the larval zebrafish eye by at least 40%. Compound 4-[4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)phenoxy]aniline ranked as the most promising candidate with reproducible and dose-dependent effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a self-deconvoluting matrix strategy applied to drug screening in zebrafish. We conclude that the orthogonal drug pooling strategy is a cost-effective, time-saving, and unbiased approach to discover novel inhibitors of developmental angiogenesis in the eye. Ultimately, this approach may identify new drugs or targets to mitigate disease caused by pathological angiogenesis in the eye, e.g., diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, wherein blood vessel growth and leaky vessels lead to vision impairment or clinical blindness. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

One of the major challenges is lack of harmonization in data analysis approaches, thereby posing difficulty in comparing findings across laboratories. To address this, we sought to establish a unified data analysis strategy for both DT and NT data, by adopting the benchmark concentration (BMC) analysis. There are two critical aspects in the BMC analysis: having a toxicity endpoint amenable for BMC and selecting a proper benchmark response (BMR) for the endpoint. For the former, in addition to the typical endpoints in NT assay (eg, hyper/hypo- response quantified by distance moved), we also used endpoints that assess the differences in movement patterns between chemical-treated embryos and control embryos. For the latter, we standardized the selection of BMR, which is analogous to minimum activity threshold, based on intrinsic response variations in the endpoint. When comparing our BMC results with a traditionally used LOAEL method (lowest-observed-adverse-effect level), we found high active compound concordance (100% for DT vs 74% for NT); generally, the BMC was more sensitive than LOAEL (no. of BMC more sensitive/no. of concordant active compounds, 43/50 for DT vs 16/26 for NT). Using the BMC with standardized toxicity endpoints and an appropriate BMR, we may now have a unified data-analysis approach to comparing results across different zebrafish datasets, for a better understanding of strengths and challenges when using the zebrafish as a screening tool. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology 2018.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfy258","Animals;Animal Shells;Benchmarking",30321397,NA

We tested the prediction by generating genome-wide sequence data for 276 individual zebrafish displaying susceptible (Affected) vs. resistant (Unaffected) phenotypes following identical chemical exposure. RESULTS: We found GxE associated with differential susceptibility in the sox7 promoter region and then confirmed gene expression differences between phenotypic response classes.

Furthermore, zebrafish is a vertebrate model particularly suited for large-scale drug screenings. The relatively small size of zebrafish, optical transparency, and lifecycle, are key characteristics that facilitate the study of multiple compounds at the same time. Several transgenic, knockdown, and mutant zebrafish lines have been generated and characterized. Therefore, it is central to critically analyze these zebrafish lines and understand their suitability as models of movement disorders. Here, we revise the pathogenic mechanisms, phenotypes, and responsiveness to pharmacotherapies of zebrafish lines of the most common movement disorders. A systematic review of the literature was conducted by including all studies reporting the characterization of zebrafish models of the movement disorders selected from five bibliographic databases. A total of 63 studies were analyzed, and the most relevant data within the scope of this review were gathered. The majority (62%) of the studies were focused in the characterization of zebrafish models of PD. Overall, the zebrafish models included display conserved biochemical and neurobehavioral features of the phenomenology in humans. Nevertheless, in light of what is known for all animal models available, the use of zebrafish as a model for drug discovery requires further optimization. Future technological developments alongside with a deeper understanding of the molecular bases of these disorders should enable the development of novel zebrafish lines that can prove useful for drug discovery for movement disorders. © 2018 Vaz, Outeiro and Ferreira.","","10.3389/fneur.2018.00347","Parkinson Disease;Drug Design;Movement Disorders;Animals",NA,NA

Materials and methods: EP/AgNPs were synthesized using methanol/water bark extract of E. polystachya and characterized using various physicochemical techniques. Results: Immersion of adult zebrafish in 111 mM glucose solution resulted in a sustained hyperglycemic, hyperlipidemic state, and serum insulin levels decreased. The synthesized EP/AgNPs showed an absorption peak at 413 nm on ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, revealing the surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that most of the particles were spherical, with a diameter of 10–12 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.197, and a zeta potential of -32.25 mV, suggesting high stability of the nanoparticles. EP/AgNPs promote pancreatic β-cell survival, insulin secretion, enhanced hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia in glucose-induced diabetic zebrafish. EP/AgNPs also showed protection of the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury. Conclusion: The results indicate that EP/AgNPs have good antidiabetic activity and therefore could be used to prevent the development of diabetes. © 2018 Garcia Campoy et al.","","10.2147/IJN.S163714","Hypoglycemic Agents",29750032,NA

Approximately 5% of the drugs screened altered circadian period, including the period-shortening compound dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; also known as prasterone). DHEA is one of the most abundant circulating steroid hormones in humans and is available as a dietary supplement in the USA. Dietary administration of DHEA to mice shortened free-running circadian period and accelerated re-entrainment to advanced light–dark (LD) cycles, thereby reducing jet-lag.

Zebrafish larvae represent a low-cost, high-throughput alternative to traditional mammalian models for the assessment of product efficacy during the initial stages of drug development. In the current study, a novel model of nociception using zebrafish larvae is described. During the recovery from an acute exposure to low levels of acetic acid, larvae display innate changes in behaviour that may be indicative of nociception. To assess the usefulness of this model for testing potential analgesics, three known synthetic pain medications were assessed (ibuprofen, acetaminophen and tramadol) along with three naturally occurring products (honokiol, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol). When the effect of each compound on both the acetic acid recovery and control activity was compared there appeared to be both similarities and differences between the compounds. One of the most interesting effects was found for cannabidiol which appeared to oppose the activity change during the recovery period of AA exposed larvae while having a nominal effect on control activity. This would appear to be in line with current research that has demonstrated the nociceptive properties of cannabidiol. Here we have provided a novel model that will complement existing zebrafish models and will expand on the potential use of zebrafish larvae for studying both nociception and new analgesics. © 2017","","10.1016/j.bbr.2017.09.028","Cannabinoids",28935439,NA

Here a platform for miniaturized high throughput whole-organism screenings is presented. The new platform is based on patterns of hydrophilic spots separated by superhydrophobic borders. The difference in wettability of spots and borders generates the effect of discontinuous dewetting and allows for formation of arrays of microdroplets that incorporate single fish embryos. Due to the flat border-less nature of the platform, the system is compatible with single-step collection of embryos and pipetting-free parallel addition of chemical libraries using the “sandwiching method.” The system is miniaturized and allows for incubation of embryos in volumes as low as 5 µL. Finally, the platform realizes surface tension based immobilization of single embryos inside of each microcompartment and permits high-throughput microscopic analysis directly on the platform.

Discovery of rapid and high-throughput techniques to screen for an effective NHEJ inhibitor drug is imperative for the suppression of NHEJ during tumor treatment. However, traditional screening methods are too cumbersome to meet the current need. Zebrafish is an ideal model for drug screening due to the specificity of its early embryonic development and similarity of tumor cell generation. By exploiting the high frequency of NHEJ in early embryonic development, we established a model that uses a transcriptional terminator signal fragment from the Simian virus 40 (SV40) to cause embryonic lethality. SV40 fragment-induced embryonic lethality was alleviated by 5,6-bis ((E)-benzylideneamino)-2-mercaptopyrimidin-4-ol or C18H14N4OS (SCR7), an NHEJ inhibitor. Materials and methods: A 122 bp SV40 terminator fragment (10 ng/µL) was microinjected into zebrafish zygotes. SV40 fragment integration into the zebrafish embryonic genome was detected by Southern blot using a DNA probe for the SV40 terminator. Embryonic lethality rates were observed 24 and 48 h after microinjection. A nonhomologous recombinant inhibitor, SCR7 (5 µM), was used to alleviate embryonic lethality. Results: Microinjection of zebrafish embryos with the SV40 terminator fragment (10 ng/µL) caused a progressive increase in mortality over time. Using Southern blots, we confirmed that SV40 terminator sequences were integrated into the zebrafish embryonic genome. This phenomenon was effectively alleviated by addition of SCR7. Conclusion: Injection of an SV40 terminator into zebrafish embryos may cause embryonic lethality due to NHEJ during early zebrafish development. The high mortality of zebrafish embryos could be alleviated by using the NHEJ inhibitor, SCR7. The zebrafish model presented here is simpler and more convenient than traditional methods of screening for NHEJ inhibitors and can be utilized in large-scale drug screens for NHEJ inhibitors and for the development of novel anticancer drugs. © 2018 Yang et al.","","10.2147/OTT.S153576","",NA,NA

While the zebrafish has been used for many years in environmental toxicology and the biomedical sciences, it has emerged more recently as an integral model to develop more robust and efficient testing strategies. This article describes major advances in genetic tools and testing approaches that have positioned the zebrafish as a key in vivo model in chemical safety evaluations particularly related to teratogenicity. Many toxic responses to chemicals have been shown to be shared among fish and mammals owing to their generally well-conserved development, cellular networks, and organ systems. These shared responses have been observed for chemicals that impair endocrine functioning, development, and reproduction, as well as those that elicit cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity, among many other diseases. High-throughput screening platforms with embryonic zebrafish now enable the screening of large chemical libraries for bioactivity providing opportunities for biological effects testing early in product development. A compelling attribute of the zebrafish centers on being able to characterize toxicity mechanisms across multiple levels of biological organization from the genome to receptor interactions and cellular processes leading to phenotypic perturbations such as developmental deformities. Along with these predictive approaches, a number of behavioral testing strategies have emerged to further assess perturbed nervous system responses to chemical exposures. Finally, there is a growing recognition of the links between human and wildlife health and the need for approaches that allow for assessment of real world multichemical exposures.

Furthermore, conditioned fish continued to seek the drug despite an adverse consequence and showed signs of stress and anxiety upon withdrawal of the drug. Finally, we validated our assay by confirming that self-administration in zebrafish is dependent on several of the same molecular pathways as in other animal models.

Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are essential for establishing gene expression profiles and likely play an important role in the development of inner ear and in the pathology of hearing-associated diseases. Zebrafish are a valuable and tractable in vivo model organism for monitoring changes in the epigenome and for identifying new epigenetic processes and drug molecules that can influence vertebrate development.

CA IX has been recently introduced as an anticancer target since it is highly overexpressed in numerous human cancers but nearly absent in normal tissues. Morphological changes in zebrafish treated by the compounds were studied by light-field microscopy and histological analysis. Homology models of zebrafish CA II and CA IX were built to identify the conserved amino acid residues in the active site of zebrafish CAs. The toxicity studies here showed that the LC50 values at 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf) were 13 μM for VD12-09, 120 μM for VD11-4-2, and 9 μM for ethoxzolamide (EZA), a non-selective CA inhibitor commonly used as a drug in clinics. Thus, EZA was the most toxic of the three compounds. The zebrafish embryos exposed to LC50 doses of VD12-09 and VD11-4-2 showed fewer phenotypic abnormalities compared with the embryos exposed to the corresponding dose of EZA. Histochemical studies did not show any gross morphological changes in the embryos treated with VD12-09 and VD11-4-2 unlike EZA. The results of our study indicate that the compounds exhibited 10-fold lower toxicity and induced fewer side effects in zebrafish than EZA. Therefore, the exposure to VD11-4-2 and VD12-09 at concentrations below LC50 did not lead to deleterious effects on the zebrafish embryonic development and thus both inhibitors may be further developed as drugs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","10.1080/01480545.2016.1223095","Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors",27600313,NA

However, FDA-approved drugs are not routinely tested for ototoxicity, so their potential to affect hearing often goes unrecognized. This issue is further compounded for natural products, where there is a lack of FDA oversight and the manufacturer is solely responsible for ensuring the safety of their products. Natural products such as herbal supplements are easily accessible and commonly used in the practice of traditional eastern and alternative medicine. Using the zebrafish lateral line, we screened a natural products library to identify potential ototoxins. We found that the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol, both from the Gingko biloba plant, demonstrated significant ototoxicity, killing up to 30 % of lateral line hair cells. We then examined a third Ginkgo flavonoid, isorhamnetin, and found similar levels of ototoxicity. After flavonoid treatment, surviving hair cells demonstrated reduced uptake of the vital dye FM 1-43FX, suggesting that the health of the remaining hair cells was compromised. We then asked if these flavonoids enter hair cells through the mechanotransduction channel, which is the site of entry for many known ototoxins. High extracellular calcium or the quinoline derivative E6 berbamine significantly protected hair cells from flavonoid damage, implicating the transduction channel as a site of flavonoid uptake. Since known ototoxins activate cellular stress responses, we asked if reactive oxygen species were necessary for flavonoid ototoxicity. Co-treatment with the antioxidant D-methionine significantly protected hair cells from each flavonoid, suggesting that antioxidant therapy could prevent hair cell loss. How these products affect mammalian hair cells is still an open question and will be the target of future experiments.

Myelinating glia allow for rapid transmission of nerve impulses and metabolic support of axons, and the absence of or disruption to myelin results in debilitating motor, cognitive, and emotional deficits in humans. Because myelin is a jawed vertebrate innovation, zebrafish are one of the simplest vertebrate model systems to study the genetics and development of myelinating glia. The morphogenetic cellular movements and genetic program that drive myelination are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, and myelin develops rapidly in zebrafish larvae, within 3–5 days postfertilization. Myelin ultrastructure can be visualized in the zebrafish from larval to adult stages via transmission electron microscopy, and the dynamic development of myelinating glial cells may be observed in vivo via transgenic reporter lines in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish are amenable to genetic and pharmacological screens, and screens for myelinating glial phenotypes have revealed both genes and drugs that promote myelin development, many of which are conserved in mammalian glia. Recently, zebrafish have been employed as a model to understand the complex dynamics of myelinating glia during development and regeneration.

We detail the process of establishing and implementing ARQiv-HTS: (i) assay design and optimization, (ii) calculation of sample size and hit criteria, (iii) large-scale egg production, (iv) automated compound titration, (v) dispensing of embryos into microtiter plates, and (vi) reporter quantification. We also outline what we see as best practice strategies for leveraging the power of ARQiv-HTS for zebrafish-based drug discovery, and address technical challenges of applying zebrafish to large-scale chemical screens. Finally, we provide a detailed protocol for a recently completed inaugural ARQiv-HTS effort, which involved the identification of compounds that elevate insulin reporter activity. Compounds that increased the number of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells represent potential new therapeutics for diabetic patients. For this effort, individual screening sessions took 1 week to conclude, and sessions were performed iteratively approximately every other day to increase throughput. At the conclusion of the screen, more than a half million drug-treated larvae had been evaluated.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a widely used vertebrate model in genetics and biologic studies. Although studies in several mammalian species have been performed, the mechanism of lysine acetylation in D. rerio embryos is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the global acetylome in D. rerio embryos by using an MS-based proteomics approach. We identified 351 acetylated peptides and 377 nonredundant acetylation sites on 189 lysine-acetylated proteins in 5-day postfertilization (hpf) embryos of D. rerio. Among lysine-acetylated peptides, 40.2% indicated three motifs: (ac)KxxxK, (ac)KxxxxK, and Lx(ac)K. Of 190 acetylated proteins, 81 (42.6%) were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm.

The effect of YH-304 on cell transformation was assessed by clonogenic assay in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs) A549 and 226B. Proapoptotic activity of YH-304 was determined by TUNEL assay and cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-9, and Bax as markers for apoptosis. The p53-dependency and therapeutic spectrum of YH-304 was assessed by western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and cell viability assays in cells expressing endogenous wild or mutant p53. The effect of YH-304 on angiogenesis in vivo was examined by bFGF-mediated angiogenesis assay in zebrafish. Finally, the effect of YH-304 on AKT and ERK activation (phosphorylation) as a putative mechanism underlying the effect of YH-304 on bFGF-mediated angiogenesis was assessed using western blotting. We found that YH-304 significantly decreases the colony-forming activities of both A549 and 226B cells, inducing cellular apoptosis. Unlike nutlin-3 (p53 pathway activator), YH-304 did not affect the expression levels of p53 and its target gene such as p21 and thus showed p53-independent anticancer activity with broad spectrum. In addition, YH-304 inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo through mediating AKT and ERK signaling pathway, which plays an important role in bFGF activation and angiogenesis. Taken together, our data indicate that YH-304 may represent a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer in a p53-independent manner.","","10.3892/ijo.2016.3726","Antineoplastic Agents",27748805,NA

However, they are also one of the most vulnerable neural cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin abnormalities in the CNS are found in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, and schizophrenia. There is an urgent need to identify small molecular weight compounds that can stimulate myelination. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis to identify pharmacodynamic effects common to miconazole and clobetasol, which have been shown to stimulate myelination by mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Of the genes differentially expressed in both miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mouse OPCs compared with untreated cells, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both drug treatments. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these DEGs are significantly associated with the sterol biosynthetic pathway, and further bioinformatics analysis suggested that sterol regulatory element binding factors (SREBFs) might be key upstream regulators of the DEGs. In silico screening of a public database for chemicals associated with SREBF activation identified fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa) agonist, as a drug that increases the expression of known SREBF targets, raising the possibility that fenofibrate may also stimulate myelination. To test this, we performed in vivo imaging of zebrafish expressing a fluorescent reporter protein under the control of the myelin basic protein (mbp) promoter. Treatment of zebrafish with fenofibrate significantly increased expression of the fluorescent reporter compared with untreated zebrafish. This increase was attenuated by co-treatment with fatostatin, a specific inhibitor of SREBFs, confirming that the fenofibrate effect was mediated via SREBFs. Furthermore, incubation of zebrafish with another PPARa agonist, gemfibrozil, also increased expression of the mbp promoter-driven fluorescent reporter in an SREBF-dependent manner. These results suggest that activation of SREBFs by small molecular weight compounds may be a feasible therapeutic approach to stimulate myelination. © 2016 Ashikawa, Nishimura, Okabe, Sasagawa, Murakami, Yuge, Kawaguchi, Kawase and Tanaka.","","10.3389/fphar.2016.00206","Fenofibrate",NA,NA

A robust and inexpensive in vivo system allowing systematic screening would be critical to exploiting this knowledge. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish a cheap and accurate screening method which can be used for testing psychoactive efficacy of complex mixtures of unknown composition, like plant crude extracts. Methods: We used automated recording of zebrafish larval swimming behavior during light vs. dark periods which we reproducibly altered with an anxiogenic compound, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). First, we reversed this PTZ-altered swimming by co-treatment with a well-defined synthetic anxiolytic drug, valproic acid (VPA). Next, we aimed at reversing it by adding crude root extracts of Valeriana officinalis (Val) from which VPA was originally derived. Finally, we assessed how expression of neural activity-regulated genes (c-fos, npas4a, and bdnf) known to be upregulated by PTZ treatment was affected in the presence of Val. Results: Both VPA and Val significantly reversed the PTZ-altered swimming behaviors. Noticeably, Val at higher doses was affecting swimming independently of the presence of PTZ. A strong regulation of all three neural-activity genes was observed in Val-treated larvae which fully supported the behavioral results.

Zebrafish larvae were screened in multi-well plates for sensitivity to the cholinergic receptor agonist, nicotine, and antagonist, atropine; and to the purinergic receptor antagonists, suramin and A-317491. Nicotine increased ventilation frequency (fV) maximally at 100 μM (EC50 = 24.5 μM). Hypoxia elevated fV from 93.8 to 145.3 breaths min-1. Atropine reduced the hypoxic response only at 100 μM.

We demonstrate a rapid approach for screening neuroactive chemicals in zebrafish with implications for respiratory medicine and carotid body disease in humans; as well as for preservation of aquatic ecosystems. © 2016 Rahbar et al.

Our goal is to better understand the molecular processes controlling retinal angiogenesis and discover novel drugs that inhibit retinal neovascularization. Phenotype-based chemical screens were performed using the ChemBridge DiversetTM library and inhibition of hyaloid vessel angiogenesis in Tg(fli1: EGFP) zebrafish. 2-[(E)-2-(Quinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenol, (quininib) robustly inhibits developmental angiogenesis at 4-10M in zebrafish and significantly inhibits angiogenic tubule formation in HMEC-1 cells, angiogenic sprouting in aortic ring explants, and retinal revascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. Quininib is well tolerated in zebrafish, human cell lines, and murine eyes. Profiling screens of 153 angiogenic and inflammatory targets revealed that quininib does not directly target VEGF receptors but antagonizes cysteinyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2 (CysLT1-2) at micromolar IC50 values. In summary, quininib is a novel anti-angiogenic small-molecule CysLT receptor antagonist. Quininib inhibits angiogenesis in a range of cell and tissue systems, revealing novel physiological roles for CysLT signaling.

If images of greater resolution and detail are required, this system is mounted on an upright microscope, such as a confocal or fluorescence microscope, to utilize their capabilities. The system loads a larvae, positions it in view of the camera, determines orientation using pattern recognition analysis, and then more precisely positions to user-defined orientation for optimal imaging of any desired tissue or organ system. Multiple images of the same larva can be collected. The specific part of each larva and the desired orientation and position is identified by the researcher and an experiment defining the settings and a series of steps can be saved and repeated for imaging of subsequent larvae. The system captures images, then ejects and loads another larva from either a bulk reservoir, a well of a 96 well plate using the LP Sampler, or individually targeted larvae from a Petri dish or other container using the VAST Pipettor.

In addition to its important role in enabling rapid nerve conduction, it has become clear in recent years that myelin plays additional vital roles in CNS function. Myelinating oligodendrocytes provide metabolic support to axons and active myelination is even involved in regulating forms of learning and memory formation. However, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how myelination by oligodendrocytes is regulated. The small tropical zebrafish has become an increasingly popular model organism to investigate many aspects of nervous system formation, function, and regeneration. This is mainly due to two approaches for which the zebrafish is an ideally suited vertebrate model-(1) in vivo live cell imaging using vital dyes and genetically encoded reporters, and (2) gene and target discovery using unbiased screens. This review summarizes how the use of zebrafish has helped understand mechanisms of oligodendrocyte behavior and myelination in vivo and discusses the potential use of zebrafish to shed light on important future questions relating to myelination in the context of CNS development, function and repair.

However, if hepatocyte proliferation is compromised, biliary epithelial cells (BECs) become the source of new hepatocytes. We recently reported on a zebrafish liver regeneration model in which BECs extensively contribute to hepatocytes. Using this model, we performed a targeted chemical screen to identify important factors that regulate BEC-driven liver regeneration, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Methods Using Tg(fabp10a:CFP-NTR) zebrafish, we examined the effects of 44 selected compounds on BEC-driven liver regeneration. Liver size was assessed by fabp10a:DsRed expression; liver marker expression was analyzed by immunostaining, in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. Proliferation and apoptosis were also examined. Moreover, we used a mouse liver injury model, choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Results We identified 10 compounds that affected regenerating liver size. Among them, only bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors, JQ1 and iBET151, blocked both Prox1 and Hnf4a induction in BECs. BET inhibition during hepatocyte ablation blocked BEC dedifferentiation into hepatoblast-like cells (HB-LCs). Intriguingly, after JQ1 washout, liver regeneration resumed, indicating temporal, but not permanent, perturbation of liver regeneration by BET inhibition. BET inhibition after hepatocyte ablation suppressed the proliferation of newly generated hepatocytes and delayed hepatocyte maturation. Importantly, Myca overexpression, in part, rescued the proliferation defect. Furthermore, oval cell numbers in mice fed CDE diet were greatly reduced upon JQ1 administration, supporting the zebrafish findings. Conclusions BET proteins regulate BEC-driven liver regeneration at multiple steps: BEC dedifferentiation, HB-LC proliferation, the proliferation of newly generated hepatocytes, and hepatocyte maturation. © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.","","10.1016/j.jhep.2015.10.017","Liver",26505118,NA

The purpose of the emerging field of phenomics is to systematically determine and measure phenotypes across biology for the sake of understanding. Phenotypes can affect more than one cell type and life stage, so ideal phenotyping would include the state of every cell type within the context of both tissue architecture and the whole organism at each life stage. In medicine, high-resolution anatomic assessment of phenotype is obtained from histology. Histology's interpretative power, codified by Virchow as cellular pathology, is derived from its ability to discern diagnostic and characteristic cellular changes in diseased tissues. Cellular pathology is observed in every major human disease and relies on the ability of histology to detect cellular change in any cell type due to unbiased pan-cellular staining, even in optically opaque tissues. Our laboratory has shown that histology is far more sensitive than stereomicroscopy for detecting phenotypes in zebrafish mutants. Those studies have also shown that more complete sampling, greater consistency in sample orientation, and the inclusion of phenotypes extending over longer length scales would provide greater coverage of common phenotypes. We are developing technical approaches to achieve an ideal detection of cellular pathology using an improved form of X-ray microtomography that retains the strengths and addresses the weaknesses of histology as a screening tool. We are using zebrafish as a vertebrate model based on the overlaps between zebrafish and mammalian tissue architecture, and a body size small enough to allow whole-organism, volumetric imaging at cellular resolution. Automation of whole-organism phenotyping would greatly increase the value of phenomics. Potential societal benefits would include reduction in the cost of drug development, a reduction in the incidence of unexpected severe drug and environmental toxicity, and more rapid elucidation of the contributions of genes and the environment to phenotypes, including the validation of candidate disease alleles identified in population and personal genetics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","","10.1016/bs.adgen.2016.05.003","",27503355,NA

The Bmp-mediated expression of the green fluorescent protein enabled the quantification of dose- and time-dependent effects of valproic acid as well as retinoic acid.

Although the zebrafish is a well-established model vertebrate for genetic and developmental studies, its use for anatomical studies of axon regeneration has been hampered by the paucity of appropriate tools to visualize re-growing axons in the adult CNS. On this account, we used transgenic zebrafish that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a GAP-43 promoter. In adult, naïve retinae, GFP was restricted to young retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Within the optic nerve, these fluorescent axons congregated in a distinct strand at the nerve periphery, indicating age-related order. Upon optic nerve crush, GFP expression was markedly induced in RGC somata and intra-retinal axons at 4 to at least 14 days post injury. Moreover, individual axons were visualized in their natural environment of the optic nerve using wholemount tissue clearing and confocal microscopy. With this novel approach, regenerating axons were clearly detectable beyond the injury site as early as 2 days after injury and grew past the optic chiasm by 4 days. Regenerating axons in the entire optic nerve were labeled from 6 to at least 14 days after injury, thereby allowing detailed visualization of the complete regeneration process. Therefore, this new approach could now be used in combination with expression knockdown or pharmacological manipulations to analyze the relevance of specific proteins and signaling cascades for axonal regeneration in vivo. In addition, the RGC-specific GFP expression facilitated accurate evaluation of neurite growth in dissociated retinal cultures. This fast in vitro assay now enables the screening of compound and expression libraries. Overall, the presented methodologies provide exciting possibilities to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying successful CNS regeneration in zebrafish. © 2015 Diekmann, Kalbhen and Fischer.","","10.3389/fncel.2015.00118","Nerve Regeneration;Regeneration",NA,NA

Impairment of sleep-wake states can be an early condition that exacerbates these disorders. Therefore, treating sleep-wake dysfunction may prevent or slow the development of these diseases.

Therefore, there is a growing demand for developing new hypnotics and psychostimulants with high efficacy and few side effects. Toward this end, animal models are indispensable for use in genetic and chemical screens to identify sleep-wake modifiers. As a proof-of-concept study, we performed behavioral profiling of zebrafish treated with chemical and genetic sleep-wake modifiers. We were able to demonstrate that behavioral profiling of zebrafish treated with hypnotics or psychostimulants from 9 to 10 days post-fertilization was sufficient to identify drugs with specific modes of action. We were also able to identify behavioral endpoints distinguishing GABA-A modulators and hypocretin (hcrt) receptor antagonists and between sympathomimetic and non-sympathomimetic psychostimulants.

However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map.

Mutagenesis rates reached 75-99%, indicating that most cells contained biallelic mutations. Recessive null-like phenotypes were observed in four of the five targeting cases, supporting high rates of biallelic gene disruption.

Time of day results indicated locomotion, tested in darkness (infrared), decreased gradually from early morning to a stable level between 13:00 and 15:30 h. All further studies were conducted in early-to-late afternoon and lasted approximately 1 h. Each study also began with a period of darkness to minimize any unintended stimulation caused by transferring the plates to the recording platform. Locomotion in darkness increased initially to a maximum at 4 min, then decreased steadily to a low level by 20 min. Locomotion during light was initially low and then gradually increased to a stable level after 20 min. When 10-min periods of light and dark were alternated, activity was low in light and high in dark; curiously, activity during alternating dark periods was markedly higher than originally obtained during either extended dark or light. Further experiments explored the variables influencing this alternating pattern of activity. Varying the duration of the initial dark period (10-20 min) did not affect subsequent activity in either light or dark.

METHODS: Zebrafish embryos were dechorionated and then exposed to a test solution from 4-6 hours post-fertilization, and embryos or larvae were assessed up to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) for viability and morphology. In preliminary experiments, the potential time points for assessment of compoundinduced dysmorphology and general toxicity parameters were evaluated, and 5 dpf was found to be the optimum developmental stage for evaluation. Additionally, a morphological scoring system was devised to identify the developmental no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). For assay evaluation, 34 compounds with adequate in vivo developmental toxicity data were chosen. The compound set represented diversity in teratogenic potencies, structural classes, and pharmacologic targets. For 31 test compounds, each was evaluated over a concentration range, while 3 others were insufficiently aqueous-soluble to be fully tested. For each of the 31 tested compounds, the 5 dpf NOAEL was determined, and the concentration resulting in 25% lethality (LC25) was calculated by curve-fitting. Teratogenic potential of each compound was predicted based on the ratio of the LC25 to the NOAEL. LC25/NOAEL ratios of 10 or greater were considered predictive of teratogenicity. RESULTS: The model successfully categorized 87% of the compounds as teratogens or non-teratogens, with only 2 false-positives (dimethyl phthalate and a Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) investigative compound) and 2 false-negatives (valproic acid and a BMS compound).

Here we examined the effect of group-size in the shoaling paradigm (ranging from 2 to 8 fish), and evaluated the ability of novel video-tracking tools to accurately track an entire shoal, compared to traditional manual analysis of shoaling phenotypes. To further validate our approach, the effects of the psychotropic drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 3,4-methlenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), as well as exposure to alarm pheromone, previously shown to affect zebrafish shoaling, were examined.

We have maintained the offspring of these exposed F0 fish to determine whether we could find adverse affects in the next two generations of F1 and F2 offspring. TCDD exposure produced a significantly higher female:male ratio in all three generations. Scoliosis-like axial skeleton abnormalities, not normally observed in controls, were present in the F1 and F2 generations descended from the treated F0 founders. Egg release and fertilization success were reduced in the TCDD lineage F1 and F2 generations. This reduction in fertility in the TCDD lineage F2 generation could be attributed to alterations in the F2 males.

Many hundreds of studies have investigated such toxicity, yet relatively few have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and/or rodent models. While this small body of evidence is largely composed of exploratory in vivo high-dose range studies, it does set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.

Cocaine, eg, acts as stimulant in mammals but no such response has been documented for zebrafish larvae. We hypothesized that differences in exposure routes (inhalation or injection in mammals vs waterborne in fish) may be a reason for differences in behavioral responses. We characterized cocaine toxicokinetics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and found its rapid uptake into larvae. We used Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging for the first time to characterize internal distribution of cocaine in zebrafish larvae. Surprisingly, eyes accumulated the highest amount of cocaine and retained most of it even after 48h depuration. We attribute this to trapping by pigment melanin, a thus far little explored mechanism that may also be relevant for other basic drugs. Cocaine also reached the brain but with levels similar to those in trunk indicating simple passive diffusion as means of distribution which was supported by toxicokinetic models. Although brain levels covered those known to cause hyperactivity in mammals, only hypoactivity (decreased locomotion) was recorded in zebrafish larvae. Our results therefore point to cocaine's anesthetic properties as the dominant mechanism of interaction in the fish: upon entry through the fish skin and gills, it first acts on peripheral nerves rapidly overriding any potential stimulatory response in the brain. © The Author 2016.","","10.1093/toxsci/kfw156","Cocaine;Zebrafish",27521082,NA

We found that exposure during embryogenesis produced few effects on the adults themselves but did affect the offspring of these fish: Malformations and increased mortality were observed in the subsequent generation. Zebrafish exposed during sexual development showed defects in the cranial and axial skeleton as adults. This was most clearly manifested as scoliosis caused by malformation of individual vertebrae.

In aquatic toxicology, behavioural tests are currently an area of controversy since inconsistent findings have been highlighted and attributed to poor quality science. The problem likely relates to limitations to our understanding of basic behavioural patterns, which can influence our ability to design statistically robust experiments yielding ecologically relevant data. The present study takes a first step towards understanding baseline behaviours in fish, including how basic choices in experimental design might influence behavioural outcomes and interpretations in aquatic toxicology. Specifically, we explored how fish acclimate to behavioural arenas and how different lengths of observation time impact estimates of basic swimming parameters (i.e., average, maximum and angular velocity). We performed a semi-quantitative literature review to place our findings in the context of the published literature describing behavioural tests with fish. Our results demonstrate that fish fundamentally change their swimming behaviour over time, and that acclimation and observational timeframes may therefore have implications for influencing both the ecological relevance and statistical robustness of behavioural toxicity tests. Our review identified 165 studies describing behavioural responses in fish exposed to various stressors, and revealed that the majority of publications documenting fish behavioural responses report extremely brief acclimation times and observational durations, which helps explain inconsistencies identified across studies.

In this respect, CRISPR/Cas9 system was employed to generate a frameshift mutation in zebrafish mrp1 causing premature translational stops in Mrp1. Significant reduction on the efflux function of Mrps was found in mutant zebrafish embryos, which correlated well with the significantly enhanced accumulation and toxicity of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and benzo[a]pyrene (BαP), indicating the protective role of the corresponding protein. The different alteration on the accumulation and toxicity of Cd2+ and BαP could be attributed to the fact that Cd2+ and its metabolites were mainly excreted by Mrp1, while BαP was primarily pumped out by Pgp.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early-life exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) could induce neurodegenerative syndromes at later-life stages in zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to BaP at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50nM from early embryogenesis to 96h post-fertilization (hpf), then transferred to clean water and maintained for 365 days. We found that BaP decreased locomotor and cognitive ability, neurotransmitter levels of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and norepinephrine; and induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and resulted in neurodegeneration. Additionally, BaP increased amyloid β protein and cell apoptosis in the adult zebrafish brain. Further, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3a were up-regulated in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. MeDIP-sequencing data of the 96 hpf larvae identified 235 differentially methylated genes in promoter, with the fold change > 1.5. Guanylate cyclase 2F (gucy2f) and dopamine receptor D4 related sequence (drd4-rs) were hypermethylation promoters, whereas zinc finger C4H2 domain (zc4h2) was a hypomethylation promoter in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. The mRNA levels of gucy2f and drd4-rs were down-regulated, and zc4h2 was up-regulated.

Recent studies show that predispositions for NCDs may arise from early-life exposure to low concentrations of environmental contaminants. This developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) paradigm suggests that programming of an embryo can be disrupted, changing the homeostatic set point of biological functions. Epigenetic alterations are a possible underlying mechanism. Here, we investigated the DOHaD paradigm by exposing zebrafish to subtoxic concentrations of the ubiquitous contaminant cadmium during embryogenesis, followed by growth under normal conditions. Prolonged behavioral responses to physical stress and altered antioxidative physiology were observed approximately ten weeks after termination of embryonal exposure, at concentrations that were 50–3200-fold below the direct embryotoxic concentration, and interpreted as altered developmental programming. Literature was explored for possible mechanistic pathways that link embryonic subtoxic cadmium to the observed apical phenotypes, more specifically, the probability of molecular mechanisms induced by cadmium exposure leading to altered DNA methylation and subsequently to the observed apical phenotypes. This was done using the adverse outcome pathway model framework, and assessing key event relationship plausibility by tailored Bradford-Hill analysis. Thus, cadmium interaction with thiols appeared to be the major contributor to late-life effects. Cadmium-thiol interactions may lead to depletion of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine, resulting in methylome alterations, and may, additionally, result in oxidative stress, which may lead to DNA oxidation, and subsequently altered DNA methyltransferase activity. In this way, DNA methylation may be affected at a critical developmental stage, causing the observed apical phenotypes. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","","10.3390/ijms17111830","Program Evaluation;Antioxidants",27827847,NA

Aging-associated diseases are sporadic but mostly inevitable complications arising from senescence. Senescence is often considered the antithesis of early development, but yet there may be factors and mechanisms in common between these two phenomena over the dynamic process of aging. The association between early development and late-onset disease with advancing age is thought to come from a consequence of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of physiologically and/or morphologically adaptive states in response to different environmental or genetic perturbations. On the one hand, we hypothesized that the future aging process can be predictive based on adaptivity during the early developmental period. Modulating the thresholds of adaptive plasticity by chemical genetic approaches, we have been investigating whether any relationship exists between the regulatory mechanisms that function in early development and in senescence using the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a small freshwater fish and a useful model animal for genetic studies. We have successfully conducted experiments to isolate zebrafish mutants expressing apparently altered senescence phenotypes during embryogenesis (""embryonic senescence""), subsequently showing shortened lifespan in adulthoods. We anticipate that previously uncharacterized developmental genes may mediate the aging process and play a pivotal role in senescence. On the other hand, unexpected senescence-related genes might also be involved in the early developmental process and regulation. The ease of manipulation using the zebrafish system allows us to conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel genes and small molecular compounds that can be linked to the senescence phenotype, and thereby facilitates searching for the evolutionary and developmental origins of aging in vertebrates.

Yet, the limited capacity to readily identify contributing PM sources and associated PM constituents in any given ambient air shed impedes risk assessment efforts. The health effects of PM have been attributed in part to its capacity to elicit irritant responses. A variety of chemicals trigger irritant behavior responses in zebrafish that can be easily measured. The purposes of this study were to examine the utility of zebrafish locomotor responses in the toxicity assessment of fine PM and its chemical fractions and uncover mechanisms of action. Locomotor responses were recorded in 6-day-old zebrafish exposed for 60min in the dark at 26 °C to the extractable organic matter of a compressor-generated diesel exhaust PM (C-DEP) and 4 of its fractions (F1-F4) containing varying chemical classes of increasing polarity. The role of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPA1, a chemical sensor in mammals and zebrafish, in locomotor responses to C-DEP, was also examined. Acrolein, an environmental irritant and known activator of TRPA1, and all extracts induced concentration-dependent locomotor responses whose potencies ranked as follows: polar F3 > weakly polar F2 > C-DEP > highly polar F4 > nonpolar F1, indicating that polar and weakly polar fractions that included nitro- and oxy-polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), drove C-DEP responses. Irritant potencies in fish positively correlated with mutagenic potencies of the same extracts in strains of Salmonella sensitive to nitro- and oxy-PAHs, further implicating these chemical classes in the zebrafish responses to CDEP. Pharmacologic inhibition of TRPA1 blocked locomotor responses to acrolein and the extracts. Taken together, these data indicate that the zebrafish locomotor assay may help expedite toxicity screening of fine PM sources, identify causal chemical classes, and uncover plausible biological mechanisms. © The Author 2017.

With a high genetic homology to humans (~75% based on coding regions), it is not surprising that humans and fish are very similar physiologically (and behaviorally). Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that zebrafish can be an excellent model of human neuropsychiatric disorders. While some classical psychiatrists may not too easily be persuaded by this generalization, the current book ""The rights and wrongs of zebrafish: principles of behavioral phenotyping and CNS disease modeling"" explains, in a domain-by-domain manner, how exactly zebrafish models can be used to target a wide range of human brain disorders and aberrant phenotypes.

Here we show that intramuscular expression in the mouse of an inducible transgene encoding constitutively active ALK2 (caALK2), resulting from a glutamine to aspartic acid change at amino acid position 207, leads to ectopic endochondral bone formation, joint fusion and functional impairment, thus phenocopying key aspects of human FOP. A selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-193189 (ref. 6), inhibits activation of the BMP signaling effectors SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in tissues expressing caALK2 induced by adenovirus specifying Cre (Ad.Cre). This treatment resulted in a reduction in ectopic ossification and functional impairment. In contrast to localized induction of caALK2 by Ad.Cre (which entails inflammation), global postnatal expression of caALK2 (induced without the use of Ad.Cre and thus without inflammation) does not lead to ectopic ossification. However, if in this context an inflammatory stimulus was provided with a control adenovirus, ectopic bone formation was induced. Like LDN-193189, corticosteroid inhibits ossification in Ad.Cre-injected mutant mice, suggesting caALK2 expression and an inflammatory milieu are both required for the development of ectopic ossification in this model.

One class of compound, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for example leflunomide, led to an almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft studies. Taken together, these studies highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that have a direct bearing on melanoma formation. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ZFNs are artificial restriction endonucleases consisting of a non-specific nuclease domain fused to a zinc finger array which can be engineered to recognize specific DNA sequences of interest. Recent proof-of-principle experiments have shown that targeted knockout mutations can be efficiently generated in endogenous zebrafish genes via non-homologous end-joining-mediated repair of ZFN-induced DNA double-stranded breaks. The Zinc Finger Consortium, a group of academic laboratories committed to the development of engineered zinc finger technology, recently described the first rapid, highly effective, and publicly available method for engineering zinc finger arrays. The Consortium has previously used this new method (known as OPEN for Oligomerized Pool ENgineering) to generate high quality ZFN pairs that function in human and plant cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that OPEN can also be used to generate ZFNs that function efficiently in zebrafish. Using OPEN, we successfully engineered ZFN pairs for five endogenous zebrafish genes: tfr2, dopamine transporter, telomerase, hif1aa, and gridlock. Each of these ZFN pairs induces targeted insertions and deletions with high efficiency at its endogenous gene target in somatic zebrafish cells. In addition, these mutations are transmitted through the germline with sufficiently high frequency such that only a small number of fish need to be screened to identify founders. Finally, in silico analysis demonstrates that one or more potential OPEN ZFN sites can be found within the first three coding exons of more than 25,000 different endogenous zebrafish gene transcripts. Conclusions and Significance: In summary, our study nearly triples the total number of endogenous zebrafish genes successfully modified using ZFNs (from three to eight) and suggests that OPEN provides a reliable method for introducing targeted mutations in nearly any zebrafish gene of interest. © 2009 Foley et al.","","10.1371/journal.pone.0004348","Mutation;Fingers;Zinc",NA,NA

Here, we constructed homodimeric TALENs to 10 different targets in various endogenous zebrafish genes and found that 7 nuclease pairs induced targeted indel mutations with high efficiencies ranging from 2 to 76%. We also tested obligate heterodimeric TALENs and found that these nucleases induce mutations with comparable or higher frequencies and have better toxicity profiles than their homodimeric counterparts. Importantly, mutations induced by both homodimeric and heterodimeric TALENs are passed efficiently through the germline, in some cases reaching 100% transmission. For one target gene sequence, we observed substantially reduced mutagenesis efficiency for a variant site bearing two mismatched nucleotides, raising the possibility that TALENs might be used to perform allele-specific gene disruption.

We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward MYC-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-ALL cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-ALL cells.

To discover potential drug candidates and dissect signaling pathways that interact with ciliary signals, we performed a chemical modifier screen for the two phenotypes using zebrafish pkd2hi4166 and ift172hi2211 models. pkd2 is a causal gene for autosomal dominant PKD and ift172 is essential for building and maintaining the cilium.

Further analysis verified that TSA inhibited cyst formation in pkd2 knockdown animals. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibiting class I HDACs, either by valproic acid (VPA), a class I specific HDAC inhibitor structurally unrelated to TSA, or by knocking down hdac1, suppressed kidney cyst formation and body curvature caused by pkd2 deficiency. Finally, we show that VPA was able to reduce the progression of cyst formation and slow the decline of kidney function in a mouse ADPKD model. Together, these data suggest body curvature may be used as a surrogate marker for kidney cyst formation in large-scale high-throughput screens in zebrafish.

We report here the development of a zebrafish early life stage fin regeneration model and its use in screening for small molecules that modulate tissue regeneration.

In addition, knockdown of the glucocorticoid receptor restores regenerative capability to nonregenerative, glucocorticoid-exposed zebrafish. To test whether the classical anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids is responsible for blocking regeneration, we prevented acute inflammation following amputation by antisense repression of the Pu.1 gene. Although loss of Pu.1 prevents the inflammatory response, regeneration is not affected. Collectively, these results indicate that signaling from exogenous glucocorticoids impairs blastema formation and limits regenerative capacity through an acute inflammation-independent mechanism.

Despite improvements in standard treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, many patients still progress to advanced stages. Recent clinical trials have shown encouraging results regarding the application of angiogenic inhibitors in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases, paving the way for novel PCa therapies. Objective: To identify new antiangiogenic compounds and examine their therapeutic potential in models of PCa. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a chemical genetic screen in developing zebrafish embryos to identify small molecules inhibiting zebrafish angiogenesis. Transgenic Tg(flk1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos were used in the screening of the Spectrum Collection compound library. Subsequently, the antiangiogenic mechanism of an identified lead compound, rosuvastatin, was studied by conducting endothelial cell function assays and examining antitumor efficacy in a PCa xenograft mouse model. Measurements, results and limitations: Seven lead compounds, including isorotenone, dihydromunduletone, aristolochic acid, simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin, were identified to inhibit the growth of the zebrafish intersegmental vessels. Of these seven leads, rosuvastatin was further evaluated for its antiangiogenic mechanism and anticancer efficacy. Rosuvastatin decreased the viability of the human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) (one-half inhibitory concentration: 5.87 μM) by inducing G1 phase arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, rosuvastatin remarkably inhibited the migration of HUVECs and dose-dependently inhibited the HUVEC capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rosuvastatin suppressed xenografted PPC-1 prostate tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice associated with decreased microvessel density (MVD) and tumor cell apoptosis. Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that rosuvastatin possesses antiangiogenic and antitumor activities and has therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa.

Recent work has demonstrated that a zebrafish model of LQT syndrome faithfully recapitulates several features of human disease, including prolongation of ventricular action potential duration, spontaneous early afterdepolarizations, and 2:1 atrioventricular block in early stages of development. Because of their transparency, small size, and absorption of small molecules from their environment, zebrafish are amenable to high-throughput chemical screens. We describe a small-molecule screen using the zebrafish KCNH2 mutant breakdance to identify compounds that can rescue the LQT type 2 phenotype. Methods and results-: Zebrafish breakdance embryos were exposed to test compounds at 48 hours of development and scored for rescue of 2:1 atrioventricular block at 72 hours in a 96-well format. Only compounds that suppressed the LQT phenotype in 3 of 3 fish were considered hits. Screen compounds were obtained from commercially available small-molecule libraries (Prestwick and Chembridge). Initial hits were confirmed with dose-response testing and time-course studies. Optical mapping with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4 ANEPPS was performed to measure compound effects on cardiac action potential durations. Screening of 1200 small molecules resulted in the identification of flurandrenolide and 2-methoxy-N-(4-methylphenyl) benzamide (2-MMB) as compounds that reproducibly suppressed the LQT phenotype. Optical mapping confirmed that treatment with each compound caused shortening of ventricular action potential durations. Structure activity studies and steroid receptor knockdown suggest that flurandrenolide functions via the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. Conclusions-: Using a zebrafish model of LQT type 2 syndrome in a high-throughput chemical screen, we have identified 2 compounds, flurandrenolide and the novel compound 2-MMB, as small molecules that rescue the zebrafish LQT type 2 syndrome by shortening the ventricular action potential duration. We provide evidence that flurandrenolide functions via the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway. These 2 molecules and future discoveries from this screen should yield novel tools for the study of cardiac electrophysiology and may lead to novel therapeutics for human LQT patients.

However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools.Results: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop 3D printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns.Conclusions: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding 3D models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3D printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users. Finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods. © 2014 Wittbrodt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","10.1186/1472-6750-14-36","",24886511,NA

Within this assay, automated image acquisition procedures and custom image analysis protocols are used to quantify body length, heart rate, circulation, pericardial area, and intersegmental vessel area within individual live embryos exposed from 5 to 72 hours post-fertilization. After ranking developmental toxicity data generated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) zebrafish teratogenesis assay, we screened 26 of the most acutely toxic chemicals within EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library in concentration-response format (0.05-50 μM) using this HCS assay. Based on this screen, we identified butafenacil as a potent inducer of anemia, as exposure from 0.39 to 3.125 μM butafenacil completely abolished arterial circulation in the absence of effects on all other endpoints evaluated. Butafenacil is an herbicide that inhibits protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) - an enzyme necessary for heme production in vertebrates. Using o -dianisidine staining, we then revealed that severe butafenacil-induced anemia in zebrafish was due to a complete loss of hemoglobin following exposure during early development. Therefore, six additional PPO inhibitors within the ToxCast Phase-I library were screened to determine whether anemia represents a common adverse outcome for these herbicides. Embryonic exposure to only one of these PPO inhibitors - flumioxazin - resulted in a similar phenotype as butafenacil, albeit not as severe as butafenacil. Overall, this study highlights the potential utility of this assay for (1) screening chemicals for cardiovascular toxicity and (2) prioritizing chemicals for future hypothesis-driven and mechanism-focused investigations within zebrafish and mammalian models. © 2014 Leet et al.","","10.1371/journal.pone.0104190","Anemia",25090246,NA

However, the isolation of sufficient amounts of these low abundant constituents for structural modification has been a challenge for several decades and subsequently halts research on the utilization of this important source of chemical entities for drug discovery and development. And, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiocerebral vascular diseases and wound healing recently. The present study investigates the pro-angiogenic potential of tanshinone derivatives produced by one-pot synthesis using zebrafish model. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to address the difficulty of chemical modification of low abundant constituents in herb medicines, a novel one-pot combinatorial modification was used to diversify a partially purified tanshinone mixture from Salvia miltiorrhiza. This led to the isolation of ten new imidazole-tanshinones (Compounds 1-10) and one oxazoletanshinone (Compound 11), the structures of which were characterized by spectroscopic methods in combination with single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. The angiogenesis activities of the new tanshinone derivatives were determined in an experimental model of chemical-induced blood vessels damage in zebrafish. Of all the tested new derivatives, compound 10 exhibited the most potent vascular protective and restorative activity with an EC50 value of 0.026 μM. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the pro-angiogenesis effect of 10 probably involved the VEGF/FGF-Src-MAPK and PI3K-P38 signalling pathways by gene expression analysis and a blocking assay with pathways-specific kinase inhibitors.

One of the bioactive plant extracts identified in this screen - Jasminum gilgianum, an Oleaceae species native to Papua New Guinea - induced ectopic tails during zebrafish embryonic development. As ectopic tail formation occurs when BMP or non-canonical Wnt signaling is inhibited during the tail protrusion process, we suspected a constituent of this extract to act as a modulator of these pathways. A bioassay-guided isolation was carried out on the basis of this zebrafish phenotype, identifying para-coumaric acid methyl ester (pCAME) as the active compound. We then performed an in-depth phenotypic analysis of pCAME-treated zebrafish embryos, including a tissue-specific marker analysis of the secondary tails. We found pCAME to synergize with the BMP-inhibitors dorsomorphin and LDN-193189 in inducing ectopic tails, and causing convergence-extension defects in compound-treated embryos. These results indicate that pCAME may interfere with non-canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of Jnk, a downstream target of Wnt/PCP signaling (via morpholino antisense knockdown and pharmacological inhibition with the kinase inhibitor SP600125) phenocopied pCAME-treated embryos. However, immunoblotting experiments revealed pCAME to not directly inhibit Jnk-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun, suggesting additional targets of SP600125, and/or other pathways, as possibly being involved in the ectopic tail formation activity of pCAME.

Accumulation of potentially toxic heavy metals in biota causes a potential health threat to their consumers including humans. This article comprehensively reviews the different aspects of heavy metals as hazardous materials with special focus on their environmental persistence, toxicity for living organisms, and bioaccumulative potential. The bioaccumulation of these elements and its implications for human health are discussed with a special coverage on fish, rice, and tobacco. The article will serve as a valuable educational resource for both undergraduate and graduate students and for researchers in environmental sciences. Environmentally relevant most hazardous heavy metals and metalloids include Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As. The trophic transfer of these elements in aquatic and terrestrial food chains/webs has important implications for wildlife and human health. It is very important to assess and monitor the concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals and metalloids in different environmental segments and in the resident biota. A comprehensive study of the environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology of hazardous heavy metals and metalloids shows that steps should be taken to minimize the impact of these elements on human health and the environment. © 2019 Hazrat Ali et al.","","10.1155/2019/6730305","Metals, Heavy",NA,NA

A multitude of chemicals induce EROD activity in a variety of fish species, the most potent inducers being structural analogs of 2,3,7,8-tetracholordibenzo-p-dioxin. Although certain chemicals may inhibit EROD induction/activity, this interference is generally not a drawback to the use of EROD induction as a biomarker. The various methods of EROD analysis currently in use yield comparable results, particularly when data are expressed as relative rates of EROD activity. EROD induction in fish is well characterized, the most important modifying factors being fish species, reproductive status and age, all of which can be controlled through proper study design. Good candidate species for biomonitoring should have a wide range between basal and induced EROD activity (e.g., common carp, channel catfish, and mummichog). EROD activity has proven value as a biomarker in a number of field investigations of bleached kraft mill and industrial effluents, contaminated sediments, and chemical spills. Research on mechanisms of CYP1A-induced toxicity suggests that EROD activity may not only indicate chemical exposure, but also may also precede effects at various levels of biological organization. A current research need is the development of chemical exposure-response relationships for EROD activity in fish. In addition, routine reporting in the literature of EROD activity in standard positive and negative control material will enhance confidence in comparing results from different studies using this biomarker.","","10.1080/10408440091159239","Biological Markers",NA,NA

The cytochrome P450-linked mixed-function oxygenase (MFO) system has been extensively validated in the environment, not only in association with point sources of pollution, but also in association with contamination over broad geographical areas. However, there is a recognized need for the establishment of biomarkers for assessing a variety of toxicological endpoints. With respect to neuromuscular functions, a recent study in the North Sea has indicated that the 'old' biomarker, acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), which is sensitive to selected organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, may be responding to low levels of contaminants in the environment, putatively by compounds other than, or in addition to, pesticides. We now provide evidence for such a possibility. A distinct depression of ACHE was found in muscle tissues of trout (Salmo trutta) taken from two urban rivers in St. John's (Virginia River and Rennie's Mill River), in comparison with a nearby reference river (South Brook). Most striking was the fact that depression was observed in the 50% range. A similar high level of enzyme depression was observed in muscle tissues of flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) taken in the area of a pulp and paper mill (Birchy Bay in the Bay of Islands), in comparison with a nearby reference site. Depression of ACHE was associated with induction of MFO enzyme activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) in liver tissues of both trout and flounder. We provide evidence and discussion that contaminants other than pesticides, including compounds in complex mixtures of combustion hydrocarbons and natural wood leachate, could be responsible for the depressed ACHE levels observed in our studies (as well as those in the North Sea) and suggest that this old biomarker may have a new future in biological monitoring and assessment programmes.","","10.1016/0025-326X(95)00112-Z","Biological Markers",NA,NA

As an alternative to the conventional acute (96 h) fish test, a modified fish embryo test will be submitted to the OECD for chemical testing in late 2005. For this, a protocol originally designed for zebrafish was adapted to fit also the requirements of other OECD species, namely medaka (Oryzias latipes) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Results document that the transfer of the protocol is possible with only minor modifications. Data obtained from embryo tests with the three species are comparable. Statistical analysis of existing zebrafish embryo toxicity data resulted in the conclusions (1) that there is a reliable correlation between the fish embryo test and the acute fish test, (2) that the confidence belt of the regression line was relatively small, but that the prediction range was relatively wide. The regression thus seems appropriate to describe the relationship between acute fish and embryo LC50 with good confidence, but is less appropriate as a prediction model. Investigations into oxygen requirements of zebrafish embryos reveal that they adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels and survive at concentrations of 2 mg/l without malformations. Zebrafish embryos can thus be exposed in very small toxicant volumes (100 μl), which is of particular interest for the testing of metabolites. Dechorionation studies with 48 h old zebrafish embryos indicate that the barrier function of the chorion increases with the lipophilicity of the test compound. Finally, examples are given as to how additional endpoints can be incorporated into the fish embryo test protocol to extend its scope, e.g. to sediment toxicity assessment or genotoxicity and mutagenicity testing.","","","Toxicity Tests",15953964,NA

This novel CALUX assay had a detection limit of 0.5 fmol of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The sensitivity and linear working range was slightly better than for the ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) assay in H4IIE wild type cells. The primary improvement of the CALUX assay compared to the EROD assay, however, is that the CALUX assay is insensitive to substrate inhibition. The CALUX activity induced by organic extracts from 450-mg aliquots of sediment or 250-μl aliquots of pore water corresponded with the instrumentally analyzed degree of pollution of the sediment. Using pore water, only a simple and rapid extraction procedure was needed, without additional clean-up to prevent cell death. The response from pore water samples in an 8-day early life stage test with zebra fish (Branchydanio rerio) corresponded with the CALUX induction, although the correlation was sometimes disturbed by heavy metals.

Other major anthropogenic sources of PAHs include smelters, the use of fossil fuels in general, and various methods of waste disposal, especially incineration. There are two major sources for PAHs to marine ecosystems in Norway: the inshore smelter industry, and offshore oil and gas production activities. A distinction is generally made between petrogenic (oil-derived) and pyrogenic (combustion-derived) PAHs. Although petrogenic PAHs appear to be bioavailable to a large extent, pyrogenic PAHs are often associated with soot particles and less available for uptake into organisms. There is extensive evidence linking sediment-associated PAHs to induction of phase-I enzymes, development of DNA adducts, and eventually neoplastic lesions in fish. Most studies have focused on high-molecular-weight, carcinogenic PAHs such as benzo[a]pyrene. It is less clear how two- and three-ring PAHs affect fish, and there is even experimental evidence to indicate that these chemicals may inhibit some components of the phase I system rather than produce induction.

NPs tend to form much larger aggregates in water, which are expected to settle down to the bottom of the water column and possibly get mixed with the sediments. However, little is known about the environmental impacts and biological effects of these aggregated NPs in the sediment column. In this study, we examined the sedimentation of nanoscale ZnO particles (nZnO) in zebrafish culture medium, and assessed the toxicity of settled nZnO aggregates on developing zebrafish embryos and larvae. Given the known dissolution of nZnO particles to release Zn2+, we also assessed the toxic effect of soluble Zn2+ in this organism. We demonstrated that within 48 h, micron-sized nZnO aggregates were formed and settled out of the culture medium. These aggregates were found to exert dose-dependent toxicity to zebrafish embryos and larvae, reducing the hatching rate and causing pericardial edema. The observed toxicity of the nZnO aggregates was not likely a result solely of particle dissolution, as soluble Zn2+ alone caused much less toxicity to zebrafish embryos than nZnO. Instead, the combination of both nZnO and Zn2+ may contribute to the embryonic toxicity, possibly by increasing reactive oxidative species (ROS) and/or compromising the cellular oxidative stress response. Interestingly, we demonstrated that one type of formulated sediments could mitigate the toxicity of nZnO aggregates, highlighting a possible countermeasure to reduce the adverse impact of nZnO aggregates on the environment. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","10.1088/0957-4484/20/19/195103","",19420631,NA

Based on a bioassay battery covering only primary producers and consumers as well as degraders, the potential ecological hazard of sediments to vertebrates cannot be estimated comprehensively. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and standardize integrated vertebrate-based test systems for sediment investigation strategies. Whereas vertebrate-based in vitro systems have frequently been used for the investigation of aqueous samples, there is a significant lack of whole sediment assays. Thus, the purpose of the present study was: (1) to develop a rapid and reliable, but comprehensive method to investigate native sediments and particulate matters without preceding extraction procedures; (2) to compare the hazard potential of solid phase sediments to the effects of corresponding pore waters and organic extracts in order to characterize the bioavailability of the particle-bound pollutants; and (3) to relatively evaluate the embryotoxic effects of sediments from the catchment areas of the rivers Rhine, Neckar and Danube. Methods (or Main Features). To investigate the toxicity of sediment samples on vertebrates, the standard embryo toxicity test with the zebrafish (Danio rerio; Hamilton-Buchanan 1922) according to DIN 38415-6 was modified with respect to exposure scheme and toxicological endpoints. Sediments from the catchment area of the Neckar River were assessed using pore waters, acetonic extracts and native sediments in order to get inside into the potential bioavailability of particle-bound pollutants. A comprehensive test protocol for the investigation of native sediments in the embryo toxicity test with the zebrafish is presented. Results and Discussion. The fish embryo assay with Danio rerio can be carried out with both aqueous and organic sediment extracts as well as native (whole, solid phase) sediment samples. Elongation of exposure time from 48 to up to 196 h significantly increased the mortality. Using the fish egg assay with native sediments, a broad range of embryotoxic effects could be elucidated, including clear-cut dose-response curves for the embryotoxic effects of contaminated sediments; in contrast, absence of embryotoxic effects could be demonstrated even for the highest test concentrations of unpolluted sediments. With native sediments, embryotoxicity was clearly higher than with corresponding pore waters, thus corroborating the view that - at least for fish eggs - the bioavailability of particle-bound lipophilic substances in native sediments is higher than generally assumed. The relative ranking of sediment toxicity was identical using both native sediments and sediment extracts, EC20 values of the latter, however, being eight time lower higher than with the native sediments. A comparison of the embryo toxic effects of samples from the Neckar area with locations along the Rhine and Danube rivers elucidated a broad range of results, thus indicating different levels of contamination. Conclusions. A modified protocol of the zebrafish embryo test allows the assessment of sediment toxicity in both aqueous extracts and native sediments. The isolated investigation of pore waters may result in a clear-cut underestimation of the bioavailability of lipophilic particle-bound substances (as determined by native sediments). Recommendations and Perspectives. The zebrafish embryo test with native (whole, solid phase) sediments appears very promising for the evaluation of the bioavailable fraction of lipophilic particle-bound substances and can therefore be recommended for the evaluation of vertebrate toxicity in tiered sediment test strategies and dredging directives such as the HABAB-WSV. Whereas acetone extracts may be tested as a rough estimation of embryotoxicity, native sediment samples will provide a more comprehensive and realistic insight into the bioavailable hazard potential.","","10.1065/jss2003.09.085","",NA,NA

The state when ROS generation exceeds elimination leading to an increased steady-state ROS level has been called “oxidative stress.” Although ROS association with many pathological states in animals is well established, the question of ROS responsibility for the development of these states is still open. Fish represent the largest group of vertebrates and they inhabit a broad range of ecosystems where they are subjected to many different aquatic contaminants. In many cases, the deleterious effects of contaminants have been connected to induction of oxidative stress. Therefore, deciphering of molecular mechanisms leading to such contaminant effects and organisms’ response may let prevent or minimize deleterious impacts of oxidative stress. This review describes general aspects of ROS homeostasis, in particular highlighting its basic aspects, modification of cellular constituents, operation of defense systems and ROS-based signaling with an emphasis on fish systems. A brief introduction to oxidative stress theory is accompanied by the description of a recently developed classification system for oxidative stress based on its intensity and time course. Specific information on contaminant-induced oxidative stress in fish is covered in sections devoted to such pollutants as metal ions (particularly iron, copper, chromium, mercury, arsenic, nickel, etc.), pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) and oil with accompanying pollutants.

Despite an increasing number of reports of species showing altered behaviour, neurotoxicity assessment for species in the environment is not required and therefore mostly not performed. Considering the increasing numbers of environmental contaminants with potential neurotoxic potential, eco-neurotoxicity should be also considered in risk assessment. In order to do so novel test systems are needed that can cope with species differences within ecosystems. In the field, online-biomonitoring systems using behavioural information could be used to detect neurotoxic effects and effect-directed analyses could be applied to identify the neurotoxicants causing the effect. Additionally, toxic pressure calculations in combination with mixture modelling could use environmental chemical monitoring data to predict adverse effects and prioritize pollutants for laboratory testing. Cheminformatics based on computational toxicological data from in vitro and in vivo studies could help to identify potential neurotoxicants. An array of in vitro assays covering different modes of action could be applied to screen compounds for neurotoxicity. The selection of in vitro assays could be guided by AOPs relevant for eco-neurotoxicity. In order to be able to perform risk assessment for eco-neurotoxicity, methods need to focus on the most sensitive species in an ecosystem. A test battery using species from different trophic levels might be the best approach. To implement eco-neurotoxicity assessment into European risk assessment, cheminformatics and in vitro screening tests could be used as first approach to identify eco-neurotoxic pollutants.

Small forms of plastics such as micro- and nanoplastics can interact with other organic contaminants, potentially acting as chemical carriers and modulating their toxicity. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of polystyrene nanoparticles (Nano-PS) and a real-world environmental PAH mixture (Elizabeth River Sediment Extract, ERSE, comprised of 36 detected PAHs) to zebrafish embryos and larvae. Embryos were exposed to Nano-PS (0.1-10 ppm) or ERSE (0.1-5% v/v, equivalent to ςPAH 5.07-25.36 ppb) or coexposed to a combination of both. Larvae exposed to Nano-PS did not exhibit developmental defects, while larvae exposed to ERSE (2-5%) showed classic signs of PAH toxicity such as heart malformation and deformities in the jaw, fin, and tail. ERSE (5%) also impaired vascular development in the brain. When coexposed, Nano-PS decreased the developmental deformities and impaired vascular development caused by ERSE. This was strongly correlated to the lower PAH bioaccumulation detected in the coexposed animals (whole larvae, as well as the yolk sac, brain, and heart). Our data suggest that PAHs are sorbing to the surface of the Nano-PS, decreasing the concentration, uptake, and toxicity of free PAHs during the exposure. Such sorption of PAHs increases the agglomeration rate of Nano-PS during the exposure time, potentially decreasing the uptake of Nano-PS and associated PAHs. Despite that, similar induction of EROD activity was detected in animals exposed to ERSE in the presence or not of Nano-PS, suggesting that enough PAHs were accumulated in the organisms to induce cellular defense mechanisms. Nano-PS exposure (single or combined with ERSE) decreased the mitochondrial coupling efficiency and increased NADH production, suggesting an impairment on ATP production accompanied by a compensatory mechanism. Our data indicate that nanoplastics can sorb contaminants and potentially decrease their uptake due to particle agglomeration. Nanoplastics also target and disrupt mitochondrial energy production and act as vectors for the mitochondrial uptake of sorbed contaminants during embryonic and larval stages. Such negative effects of nanoplastics on energy metabolism and efficiency could be detrimental under multiple-stressors exposures and energy-demanding scenarios, which remains to be validated. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","","10.1021/acs.est.9b02003","",31259535,NA

In equilibrium experiments, 3 ng of oestrone or 3.2 ng of 17β-oestradiol was added in each of the centrifuge tubes. Sorption onto sediment particles was relatively slow, with sorption equilibrium being reached in about 70 and 170 h for oestrone and 17β-oestradiol, respectively. The effects of a variety of environmental parameters on sorption were studied including salinity, sediment concentration (SC), the presence of a third phase, particle size and, also, surfactant concentrations. Results show that although salinity did not induce any statistically significant effect on the sorption of 17β-oestradiol, it did statistically enhance the sorption of oestrone, and a salting constant of 0.3 1 mol-1 was derived. The partition coefficient for both compounds decreased with increasing sediment concentration, a phenomenon that has been widely reported and attributed to the presence of colloids (which could enhance dissolved concentrations).

TCDD induces CYP1A1 gene expression and results of extensive research have delineated the molecular mechanism of this response. In target cells, TCDD initially binds to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor which accumulates in the nucleus as an Ah-receptor:aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein heterodimeric complex. The nuclear Ah receptor complex acts as a ligand-induced transcription factor which binds to transacting genomic dioxin/xenobiotic responsive elements (DREs/XREs) located in the 5'-regulatory region upstream from the initiation start site and this interaction results in transactivation of gene transcription. DREs have been identified in several other genes which are induced by TCDD, including CYP1A2, aldehyde-3-dehydrogenase, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase, and glutathione S transferase Ya and similar induction response pathways have been observed or proposed. However, TCDD and other Ah receptor agonists also inhibit expression of several genes and research in this laboratory has investigated inhibition of estrogen (E2)-induced genes including uterine epidermal growth factor, c-fos protooncogene, and the progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor (ER) and cathepsin D genes in human breast cancer cell lines. In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, E2 induces cathepsin D gene expression and this is associated with formation of an ER/Sp1 complex at the sequence in the promoter region (-199/-165) of this gene. Within 30 min TCDD causes a rapid inhibition of E2-induced cathepsin D gene expression in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides which include the wild-type ER/Sp1 and various mutants, it was shown by gel electromobility shift and transient transfection assays that the nuclear Ah receptor complex binds to an imperfect DRE located between the ER and Sp1 binding sequences.

So far, however, several endpoints including genotoxicity in vertebrate-based systems could be tested only after transfer of particle-bound substances into the aqueous phase. The present study was carried out to develop a protocol for generating a suspension of single cells from sediment-exposed zebrafish embryos that is suitable for detecting particle-bound genotoxicity in the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). In this solid-phase genotoxicity assay, a whole-body cell suspension derived from zebrafish embryos exposed to native (whole) sediments is assayed in the comet assay. Several chemical and mechanical isolation procedures were compared to optimize cell yield and minimize DNA damage by the method itself. If compared to collagenase isolation, mechanical cell dissociation gave less DNA damage; trypsinization resulted in similarly low DNA damage but significantly lower cell yield. In order to test the optimized protocol, effects of well-known genotoxicants (4-nitroquinoline-N- oxide, nitrofurantoin, hydrogen peroxide, benzo[a]pyrene) and of two sediments from the upper Rhine River (Germany) on zebrafish embryos were investigated. Results documented clear-cut genotoxicity for all four substances and for one of the two whole-sediment samples. An ultraviolet (UV) light exposure of whole embryos and primary cultures from embryos elucidated only minor effects for the whole embryos compared to the primary cells. Consequently, UV irradiation cannot be suggested as a positive control in intact zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, the newly developed sediment contact assay can be recommended for the detection of both single substances but also the bioavailable fraction of the total hazard potential of sediments. © 2006 SETAC.","","10.1897/05-460R.1","Mutagenicity Tests",16916029,NA

In this paper, the concentrations of 9 selected pharmaceuticals were determined in water and sediment samples from the River Medway, Kent, UK between December 2009 and December 2010. In the water phase, there was a spatial variation of concentration with the highest concentrations being detected in the sewage outfall, indicating it being an important point source in the river. In terms of seasonal variations, the highest concentrations (13-878ngL-1) were detected in June 2010. In the surface sediment phase, the highest concentrations (5.3-33.6ngg-1 dry weight) were observed at the sewage outfall, although in February 2010 the highest concentrations were detected downstream of the sewage outfall indicating a delayed response in sediment accumulation of pharmaceuticals in relation to the water phase. The partition coefficient of pharmaceuticals between surface sediment and water was variable, reflecting a dynamic process of sediment-water interaction and the varying nature of sediments. Overall the partition coefficient was shown to decrease with an increase in suspended sediment concentration. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficient of the pharmaceuticals was shown to be positively related to their molecular weight (MW), suggesting that sediment-water interactions were partly a partition process favoring large molecules. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","10.1016/j.watres.2013.09.026","",24091188,NA

The thematic areas of its current employment in the evaluation of genetic toxicity are vast, either in vitro or in vivo, both in the laboratory and in the environment, terrestrial or aquatic. It has been applied to a wide range of experimental models: bacteria, fungi, cells culture, arthropods, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and humans. This document is intended to be a comprehensive review of what has been published to date on the field of ecotoxicology, aiming at the following main aspects: (i) to show the most relevant experimental models used as bioindicators both in the laboratory and in the field. Fishes are clearly the most adopted group, reflecting their popularity as bioindicator models, as well as a primary concern over the aquatic environment health. Amphibians are among the most sensitive organisms to environmental changes, mainly due to an early aquatic-dependent development stage and a highly permeable skin. Moreover, in the terrestrial approach, earthworms, plants or mammalians are excellent organisms to be used as experimental models for genotoxic evaluation of pollutants, complex mix of pollutants and chemicals, in both laboratory and natural environment. (ii) To review the development and modifications of the protocols used and the cell types (or tissues) used. The most recent developments concern the adoption of the enzyme linked assay (digestion with lesion-specific repair endonucleases) and prediction of the ability to repair of oxidative DNA damage, which is becoming a widespread approach, albeit challenging. For practical/technical reasons, blood is the most common choice but tissues/cells like gills, sperm cells, early larval stages, coelomocytes, liver or kidney have been also used. (iii) To highlight correlations with other biomarkers. (iv) To build a constructive criticism and summarize the needs for protocol improvements for future test applications within the field of ecotoxicology.

Recent work has shown that uptake of persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the food web is strongly influenced by the nature of contaminant binding, especially to black carbon surfaces in sediments. We demonstrate for the first time in a contaminated river that application of activated carbon to sediments in the field reduces biouptake of PCBs in benthic organisms. After treatment with activated carbon applied at a dose similar to the native organic carbon of sediment, bioaccumulation in freshwater oligochaete worms was reduced compared to preamendment conditions by 69 to 99%, and concentrations of PCBs in water at equilibrium with the sediment were reduced by greater than 93% at all treatment sites for up to three years of monitoring. By comparing measured reductions in bioaccumulation of tetra- and penta-chlorinated PCB congeners resulting from field application of activated carbon to a laboratory study where PCBs were preloaded onto activated carbon, it is evident that equilibrium sorption had not been achieved in the field. Although other remedies may be appropriate for some highly contaminated sites, we show through this pilot study that PCB exposure from moderately contaminated river sediments may be managed effectively through activated carbon amendment in sediments. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","","10.1021/es202218p","Biological Availability",22077959,NA

Given their well-known properties to accumulate organic pollutants, Lake Laguna sediments have been investigated by use of a newly developed sediment-contact assay to determine the bioavailable fraction of the total genotoxic hazard potential. Freshly fertilized zebrafish eggs (2 h after fertilization) were allowed to develop while exposed to different concentrations of freeze-dried sediments (exposure to bioavailable compounds) as well as organic extracts (complete genotoxic hazard potential including bioaccumulation) prepared from sediments collected at five sites within the lake. Following a 96 h exposure, single-cell suspensions were prepared from macerated larvae and analyzed for DNA strand-breaks by use of the comet assay. Genotoxicity could be identified in both solid-phase exposure scenarios as well as after exposure to organic sediment extracts. Only the South Bay (SB) site did not show a significant genotoxic burden relative to controls in tests of both freeze-dried sediment and organic extracts. In contrast, the Northwest Bay site displayed pronounced genotoxicity to the zebrafish embryos in both exposure scenarios. Perylene and copper in the sediments could be identified as potential causes of the genotoxic response. To compare the results (maximum induction coefficients) of zebrafish embryos with an established comet protocol, rainbow trout liver cells (RTL-W1) were exposed to the same extracts. The findings correlated well (Spearman correlation r = 0.90), proving a good reliability of the results from zebrafish primary cells.

This could cause impaired motility, which can ultimately lead to their death. Exposure to zebrafish embryos revealed that TBC had the most significant influence on the larvae at 72-96 h postfertilization, which coincided with the time that the gas bladder first inflates. Critical factors involved in early zebrafish gas bladder development remained at normal levels, which indicated that TBC caused defects in the inflation of the gas bladder without disrupting early organogenesis. However, the ultrastructure of the gas bladder was altered in the TBC-treated groups: the electron density of cytoplasmic vesicles was changed and the mitochondria were damaged. We deduce that TBC causes damage to mitochondria that influences the secretion of mucus-like material, resulting in defects in gas bladder inflation.

Many teleosts therefore possess a gas-filled swimbladder that provides lift, allowing fish to attain neutral buoyancy.

In this study, we have used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate changes in the size and shape of the swimbladder during development and examine whether these changes affect the hydrostatic contribution of the swimbladder during swimming. Our results showed that swim-up behavior is critical for larvae to first inflate their swimbladder, decrease body density, and attain neutral buoyancy. Following inflation, we found a strong linear correlation between fish volume and swimbladder volume over ontogeny. This trend was supported by measures of the density of zebrafish, which was conserved within a narrow range between 1.00±0.001 and 0.996±0.001g/cm3 despite an increase in the swimming depth of zebrafish, which occurred upon transition to a double-chambered organ.

Within the last 15 to 20 years, however, the scientific community has begun noticing deterioration of sediment quality at an alarming rate worldwide. Sediments are now harboring hazardous pollutants that can directly influence water quality, thereby creating very stressful conditions for aquatic life. As a consequence, global efforts were initiated in the early 1970s, to find ways to assess sediment quality. Because of their obvious ecological and economic significance, fish have remained a major taxonomic group for appraising the general quality of aquatic systems. However, for sediment risk assessment, fish have lagged behind invertebrates due to their mobility and generally, pelagic lifestyle. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively presents and reviews the versatile role of fish in assessing the state of health of aquatic sediments. Main features: Through a literature search of the more relevant and/or more recent studies, this review attempted to trace the development of the various approaches as well as to describe the future prospects of using fish as sentinels for sediment quality assessment. Initially, the use of whole fish (juveniles or adults) bioassays contributed immensely to our understanding of sediment contamination and ecotoxicology. But due to economic as well as ethical issues linked to the use of live vertebrates for toxicity testing, the approach has shifted to using fish cell cultures and fish embryos. Much newer approaches involving receptors and gene arrays in fish cells to elucidate the mode of action of sediment-borne contaminants are very promising. The review paper also lists and explores some of the issues associated with the use of juvenile or adult fish, fish cell cultures, fish embryos, and fish gene expression profiles in sediment toxicity evaluations to stimulate further discussions, and hopefully, to serve as benchmark for future handling of similar or related aspects of fish utilization in sediment risk assessment. Conclusions and perspectives: Overall, the present review has comprehensively explored the changing and progressing roles of fish in sediment toxicity evaluation. Indeed the usefulness of this taxon as test organisms has provided a significant contribution to the advancement of sediment toxicology. However, despite the quite optimistic and bright future for these current procedures, a number of issues and problems remain. Therefore, efforts to develop new technologies and to refine current methods and approaches continue to challenge many laboratories worldwide. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","","10.1007/s11368-010-0302-7","",NA,NA

In addition, morphological changes in zebrafish embryos induced by NMs were classified in four reaction models, allowing classification of the mode of action and toxicity of different types of NM. Revised data showed that the interaction and bioaccumulation of NMs on zebrafish embryos were associated to several toxic effects, while the detoxification process was limited. In general, NMs induced delayed hatching, circulatory changes, pigmentation and tegumentary alterations, musculoskeletal disorders and yolk sac alterations on zebrafish embryos.

While water quality strongly improved over decades in the Rhine River, sediments still reflect elapsed contaminations of organic pollutants and heavy metals. In comparing genotoxic effects induced by both sediment extracts and whole sediments, a ratio of bioavailable toxicity and total extractable toxicity is obtained. Since contaminated sites whose contaminants are toxic and as well bioavailable present an elevated risk to the ecosystem, such ratios may be used as a warning signal to identify sites of primary concern. Methods. Accordingly, two different exposure scenarios were compared to reveal the genotoxic potential of 18 sediment samples derived from 9 sample sites along the River Rhine. For assessment of effects on genome integrity, DNA fragmentation was measured using the comet assay with primary cells isolated from zebrafish embryos previously exposed to either organic sediment extracts or freeze-dried sediments at sublethal concentrations. Additionally, chemical data were used to determine responsible pollutants and correlate them with biological effects. Results. Whereas 17 out of 18 sediment extracts caused significant DNA damage to the embryo cells, only 4 native sediments showed a genotoxic potential. Thus, under field-like exposure conditions, a major part of potentially genotoxic compounds seem to remain particle-bound and ineffective, as shown for whole sediment exposure. Conversely, the organic extracts seem to contain enriched concentrations even of hardly soluble substances. Hence, organic extracts may be used as a screening tool to address potentially polluted sites, even though the relevance of these results for the field situation may be questionable. Investigations on native sediments determined few sites with bioavailable and therefore ecologically most relevant genotoxic sediment compounds. Discussion. However, these results may underestimate the total hazard potential of sample sites with hardly bioavailable substances. Chemical data revealed a variety of anthropogenic pollutants, ranging from PAHs to heavy metals. Nevertheless, chemical data on the measured priority pollutants did not fully explain the pollution pattern of the bioassays but clearly determined substances of concern (e.g., HCB, heavy metals) in particular sample sites. Conclusions. There is a striking advantage in assessing the genotoxicity by means of different exposure scenarios that focus on either bioavailable or extractable fractions, as the combination of the results allows obtaining information on specific properties of the genotoxicants and their bioavailability. An additional correlation with chemical data should be required to identify priority pollutants, as long as the responsible contaminant is known a priori. As many studies revealed inherent failures of such a correlation, an effect-driven analysis of pollutants is recommended as a promising tool to identify even non-priority pollutants by means of their ecotoxicological effectiveness. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH), D-86899 Landsberg and Tokyo.","","10.1065/jss2007.11.261","DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Biological Availability;DNA Fragmentation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",NA,NA

Sediment toxicology plays a major role in this intention as sediments can act as a secondary source of pollution. In order to fulfill this legal obligation, there is an urgent need to develop whole-sediment exposure protocols, since sediment contact assays represent the most realistic scenario to simulate in situ exposure conditions. Therefore, in the present study, a vertebrate sediment contact assay to determine aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated activity of particle-bound pollutants was developed. Furthermore, the activity and the expression of the CYP1 family in early life stages of zebrafish after exposure to freeze-dried sediment samples were investigated. In order to validate the developed protocol, effects of β-naphthoflavone and three selected sediment on zebrafish embryos were investigated. Results documented clearly AhR-mediated toxicity after exposure to β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) and to the sediment from the Vering canal. Upregulation of mRNA levels was observed for all investigated sediment samples. The highest levels of all investigated cyp genes (cyp1a, cyp1b1, cyp1c1, and cyp1c2) were recorded after exposure to the sediment sample of the Vering canal. In conclusion, the newly developed sediment contact assay can be recommended for the investigation of dioxin-like activities of single substances and the bioavailable fraction of complex environmental samples. Moreover, the exposure of whole zebrafish embryos to native (freeze-dried) sediment samples represents a highly realistic and ecologically relevant exposure scenario. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","10.1007/s11356-014-3185-0","Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon",24958532,NA

Sediments from the three sites displayed different cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and teratogenicity potencies; however, all three assays yielded similar LOECs (lowest observed effect concentration) for each site, suggesting that the assays were equally sensitive to and suitable for initial screening of the LOECs of marine sediments. The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and teratogenicity for these three sampling sites were in the same order of LC > ZQ > OSC, indicating different degrees of contamination. Interestingly, trials with the three sediment extracts at the doses inducing a similar cytotoxicity as evaluated with MTT reduction did not produce similar genotoxicity and teratogenicity, with the genotoxic and teratogenic activities of LC and ZQ extracts being markedly higher than those of OSC sediments. These findings indicate that cytotoxicity does not form a fully equivalent toxicity index with that of genotoxicity and teratogenicity. Therefore, in order to assess the true toxic potential of marine sediments, all three assays should be performed.

Secondly, we assessed the potential impact on human and environmental health of bioavailable BDE-209 using human in vitro cell assays and zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish were exposed from 4. h to 8. days post-fertilization to sediments spiked with 12.5. mg/kg of BDE-209. Zebrafish larvae accumulated ten fold more BDE-209 than controls in unspiked sediment after 8. days. BDE-209 impacted expression of neurological pathways and altered behavior of larvae, although BDE-209 had no visible affect on thyroid function or motoneuron and neuromast development. Zebrafish data and in silico predictions suggested that BDE-209 would also interact with key human transcription factors and receptors. We therefore tested these predictions using mammalian in vitro assays.

Meanwhile, bioassays with zebrafish, an established model organism in different research areas, are increasingly being utilized in EDA. Aiming to contribute for the optimal application of zebrafish bioassays in EDA, this review provides a critical overview of previous EDA investigations that applied zebrafish bioassays, discusses the potential contribution of such methods for EDA and proposes strategies to improve future studies. Over the last 10 years, zebrafish bioassays have guided EDA of natural products and environmental samples. The great majority of studies performed bioassays with embryos and early larvae, which allowed small-scale and low-volume experimental setups, minimized sample use and reduced workload. Biotesting strategies applied zebrafish bioassays as either the only method guiding EDA or instead integrated into multiple bioassay approaches. Furthermore, tiered biotesting applied zebrafish methods in both screening phase as well as for further investigations. For dosing, most of the studies performed solvent exchange of extracts and fractions to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as carrier. However, high DMSO concentrations were required for the testing of complex matrix extracts, indicating that future studies might benefit from the evaluation of alternative carrier solvents or passive dosing. Surprisingly, only a few studies reported the evaluation of process blanks, indicating a need to improve and standardize methods for blank preparation and biotesting. Regarding evaluated endpoints, while acute toxicity brought limited information, the assessment of specific endpoints was of strong value for bioactivity identification. Therefore, the bioassay specificity and sensitivity to identify the investigated bioactivity are important criteria in EDA. Additionally, it might be necessary to characterize the most adequate exposure windows and assessment setups for bioactivity identification. Finally, a great advantage of zebrafish bioassays in EDA of environmental samples is the availability of mechanism- and endpoint-specific methods for the identification of important classes of contaminants. The evaluation of mechanism-specific endpoints in EDA is considered to be a promising strategy to facilitate the integration of EDA into weight-of-evidence approaches, ultimately contributing for the identification of environmental contaminants causing bioassay and ecological effects. © 2015, Di Paolo et al.; licensee Springer.","","10.1186/s12302-015-0040-y","",NA,NA

AC treatments were mixing with powdered AC (PAC), mixing with granular AC (GAC), and addition-removal of GAC (sediment stripping). The AC treatments resulted in a significant decrease in HOC concentrations in pore water, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, macrophytes, and fish. In 6 months, PAC treatment caused a reduction of accumulation of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) in fish by a factor of 20, bringing pollutant levels below toxic thresholds. All AC treatments supported growth of fish, but growth was inhibited in the PAC treatment, which was likely explained by reduced nutrient concentrations, resulting in lower zooplankton (i.e., food) densities for the fish.

Embryos were exposed to varying concentrations of toxicants from 0–72 h post-fertilization (hpf). Embryotoxicity at 72 hpf showed a dose-dependent increase in mortality upon exposure to extracts from all zones, except Atlas Cove. Similarly, higher levels of teratogenic effects, such as increased oedema, and haemorrhage and developmental abnormalities resulted from exposure to extracts from Ilaje, Iddo and Apapa zones.

The present study characterizes the effects of disruption of TH synthesis on swim bladder inflation during zebrafish early-life stages using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), a thyroid peroxidase (TPO) inhibitor. Zebrafish were exposed to different MBT concentrations until 120/168 h post fertilization (hpf) and 32 days post fertilization (dpf), in two sets of experiments, to investigate the effects of TPO inhibition on posterior and anterior swim bladder inflation respectively, as well as whole body thyroid hormone concentrations (triiodothyronine (T3) and its prohormone, thyroxine (T4)). At 120 hpf, MBT did not directly impair posterior chamber inflation or size, while anterior chamber inflation and size was impaired at 32 dpf. As previously shown in amphibians and mammals, we confirmed that MBT inhibits TPO in fish. Whole-body T4 decreased after MBT exposure at both time points, while T3 levels were unaltered. There was a significant relationship between T4 levels and the anterior chamber surface at 32 dpf. The absence of effects on posterior chamber inflation can possibly be explained by maternal transfer of T4 into the eggs. These maternally derived THs are depleted at 32 dpf and cannot offset TPO inhibition, resulting in impaired anterior chamber inflation. Therefore, we hypothesize that TPO inhibition only inhibits swim bladder inflation during late development, after depletion of maternally derived T4. In a previous study, we showed that iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) knockdown impaired posterior chamber inflation during early development. Our findings, in parallel with similar effects observed in fathead minnow (see part I, this issue) suggest that thyroid disruption impacts swim bladder inflation, and imply an important distinction among specific subtypes of TH disrupting chemicals. However, the existence of another - yet unknown - mode of action of MBT impacting swim bladder inflation cannot be excluded. These results can be helpful for delineating adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) linking TPO inhibition, ID inhibition and other TH related molecular initiating events, to impaired swim bladder inflation in fish during early life stages. Such AOPs can support the use of in vitro enzyme inhibition assays for predicting reduced survival due to impaired posterior and anterior chamber inflation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.12.023","Peroxidases;Peroxidase;Thyroid Gland",26818709,NA

For toxicity assessment, each sediment extract was tested with the standard fish embryo test (FET). Upon completion of a functioning liver after 72 h, the embryos gave a distinct fluorescent signal in the liver, and a corresponding EROD activity could be detected in the fish embryo EROD assay. The exposure time in the live-imaging EROD assay was reduced to 3 h, which resulted in a stronger, less variable and more sensitive EROD response. Overall, the live-imaging and the fish embryo EROD assays showed the same tendencies and gave comparable results, e.g. a concentration-dependent increase in EROD activity at concentrations one order of magnitude below concentrations producing macroscopically visible abnormalities. At higher concentrations, however, a decrease of EROD activity was observed in either test. Both tests ranked the three model sediment extracts in the same order.

Toxic effects of wastewaters within and downstream of the WWTP in City of Virovitica, Croatia, were tested on zebrafish Danio rerio using a set of biomarkers that enabled an insight in wastewaters toxic potential on embryos at the cellular, tissue and the whole organism level during an early ontogenesis (24 and 48 hpf). Exposure of embryos to the wastewater samples from WWTP Virovitica increased mortality and abnormality rate. Heart rate, spontaneous movements and pigmentation formation were also markedly affected. Biochemical markers confirmed the presence of MXR inhibitors in all tested wastewater samples, indicating the increase of pollutant accumulation in the cell/organism. Also, a tendency of DNA damage decrease measured with Comet assay was evident in wastewater samples downstream from WWTP although control levels were not reached in any environmental sample.

The regulatory test procedures are elaborate and the requirement of numerous animals is ethically disputable. Therefore, non-animal alternatives are highly desirable, but appropriate test systems that meet regulatory demands are not yet available. Hence, we have developed a new developmental neurotoxicity assay based on specific whole-mount immunostainings of primary and secondary motor neurons (using the monoclonal antibodies znp1 and zn8) in zebrafish embryos. By classifying the motor neuron defects, we evaluated the severity of the neurotoxic damage to individual primary and secondary motor neurons caused by chemical exposure and determined the corresponding effect concentration values (EC50). In a proof-of-principle study, we investigated the effects of three model compounds thiocyclam, cartap and disulfiram, which show some neurotoxicity-indicating effects in vertebrates, and the positive controls ethanol and nicotine and the negative controls 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and triclosan. As a quantitative measure of the neurotoxic potential of the test compounds, we calculated the ratios of the EC50 values for motor neuron defects and the cumulative malformations, as determined in a zebrafish embryo toxicity test (zFET). Based on this index, disulfiram was classified as the most potent and thiocyclam as the least potent developmental neurotoxin. The index also confirmed the control compounds as positive and negative neurotoxicants. Our findings demonstrate that this index can be used to reliably distinguish between neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic chemicals and provide a sound estimate for the neurodevelopmental hazard potential of a chemical.

Sediment quality criteria, for the assessment of habitat quality and risk for aquatic life, include understanding the fate and effects of PAHs. In the context of European regulation (REACH and Water Framework Directive), the first objective was to assess the influence of sediment composition on the toxicity of two model PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene using 10-day zebrafish embryo-larval assay. This procedure was undertaken with an artificial sediment in order to limit natural sediment variability. A suitable sediment composition might be then validated for zebrafish and proposed in a new OECD guideline for chemicals testing. Second, a comparative study of toxicity responses from this exposure protocol was then performed using another OECD species, the Japanese medaka. The potential toxicity of both PAHs was assessed through lethal (e.g., survival, hatching success) and sublethal endpoints (e.g., abnormalities, PMR, and EROD) measured at different developmental stages, adapted to the embryonic development time of both species. Regarding effects observed for both species, a suitable artificial sediment composition for PAH toxicity testing was set at 92.5 % dry weight (dw) silica of 0.2–0.5-mm grain size, 5 % dw kaolin clay without organic matter for zebrafish, and 2.5 % dw blond peat in more only for Japanese medaka.

Regardless of whether the chironomids had been loaded with Cd via a waterborne exposure or sediment exposure, they had similar subcellular distributions of Cd, with the largest areas of storage being metal rich granules (MRG) > organelles (ORG) > enzymes (ENZ) except that sediment-exposed chironomids had significantly more Cd in the metallothionein-like protein (MTLP) fraction, and significantly less Cd in the cellular debris (CD) fraction. When zebrafish fed sediment-exposed chironomids (153 ± 11 μg Cd/g dry weight) were compared directly to zebrafish fed waterborne exposed chironomids (288 ± 12 μg Cd/g dry weight), identical whole-body Cd levels were observed, despite the difference in the concentration in the food source. Thus trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) of Cd was significantly greater from sediment-exposed chironomids (2.0 ± 0.5%) than from waterborne-exposed chironomids (0.7 ± 0.2%). Subsequent tests with waterborne exposed chironomids loaded to comparable Cd concentrations, as well as with Cd-spiked manufactured pellets, demonstrated that TTEs were concentration-independent. In all treatments, zebrafish exhibited similar subcellular storage of Cd, with the greatest uptake occurring in the ORG fraction followed by the ENZ fraction. However, neither trophically available metal (TAM) nor metabolically available fractions (MAF) were good predictors for the TTEs found in this study. Tissue Cd concentrations were highest in the kidney and gut tissue, then liver, but lower in the gill, and carcass. Overall, the gut and carcass contributed ≥71% to total body burdens on a mass-weighted basis.

Aiming at a more mechanistic understanding of the results of such studies, knowledge about commonalities of transcript regulation in response to chemical stress is needed. Thus, our goal in this study was to identify and interpret genes and gene sets constituting a general response to chemical exposure. Therefore, we aggregated and reanalyzed published toxicogenomics data obtained with the ZFE. We found that overlap of differentially transcribed genes in response to chemical stress across independent studies is generally low and the most commonly differentially transcribed genes appear in less than 50% of all treatments across studies. However, effect size analysis revealed several genes showing a common trend of differential expression, among which genes related to calcium homeostasis emerged as key, especially in exposure settings up to 24h post-fertilization. Additionally, we found that these and other downregulated genes are often linked to anatomical regions developing during the respective exposure period. Genes showing a trend of increased expression were, among others, linked to signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt, Fgf) as well as lysosomal structures and apoptosis. The findings of this study help to increase the understanding of chemical stress responses in the developing zebrafish embryo and provide a starting point to improve experimental designs for this model system. In future, improved time- and concentration-resolved experiments should offer better understanding of stress response patterns and access to mechanistic information. © The Author 2017.

Furthermore, experimental outcomes could be clustered in 13 toxicity endpoints, mainly developmental toxicity, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. Organophosphorus, pyrethroid, azole, and triazine were the most studied classes of pesticides and associated with various toxicity endpoints. Studies frequently opted for early life stages (embryos and larvae). Although there is an evident lack of standardization of nomenclatures and phenotypic alterations, the information gathered here highlights associations between (classes of) pesticides and endpoints, which can be used to relate mechanisms of action specific to certain classes of chemicals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","10.1007/s11356-020-07902-5","Pesticides;Toxicity Tests",32062774,NA

Data obtained from model calculations were in good agreement with those of the experiments. Results of the model calculations showed that 86.50% of all NP input was removed by advective outflow, while 61.99% of the remainder was distributed to the sediment phase, 34.89% to the water phase, 2.50×10-2% to SM and 3.13% to the biotic phase.

To support and extend previous work in that field, this study was conducted to assess the impact of surface water and sediment on fish embryos in the case of a highly anthropogenically influenced river catchment in Central Hesse, Germany. Results: The results of 96 h post fertilisation fish embryo toxicity test with Danio rerio (according to OECD Guideline 236) revealed that river samples comprising both water and sediment exert pivotal effects in embryos, whereas surface water alone did not. The most prominent reactions were developmental delays and, to some extent, malformations of embryos. Developmental delays occurred at rates up to 100% in single runs. Malformation rates ranged mainly below 10% and never exceeded 25%. Conclusion: A clear relationship between anthropogenic point sources and detected effects could not be established. However, the study illustrates the critical condition of the entire river system with respect to embryotoxic potentials present even at the most upstream test sites.

This approach is of high importance as especially the investigation of dispersant toxicity in relevant exposure concentrations is rather scarce. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different WAFs shortly after and up to 120 hour post fertilization (hpf). Besides phenotypic effects including edema and spine deformations, reduced responses to dark stimuli, increased CYP1A activity and marginal AChE inhibition were observed in sublethal effect concentrations. Both oil types had varying strength of toxicity, which did not correlate with corresponding chemical analysis of target PAHs. Chemically dispersed oils induced stronger acute toxicity in zebrafish embryos compared to native (initial) oil exposure, which was further reflected by very low exposure concentrations for biomarker endpoints. Based on a comparison to the dispersant alone, a higher toxicity of dispersed oils was related to a combination of dispersant toxicity and an elevated crude oil compound bioavailability, due to dispersion-related partitioning kinetics. In contrast to LEWAF and CEWAF neither typical morphological effects nor mechanism-specific toxicity were observed for the dispersant alone, indicating narcosis as the responsible cause of effects. © 2019","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136174","Biological Markers",31884285,NA

In contact with contaminated sediment, fish eggs and embryos may be exposed to metals via the water phase as well as via direct contact with contaminated particles. This may result in body burdens that are difficult to predict and may vary according to individual micro scale exposure conditions. The highly sensitive total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) may provide a tool to analyse individual embryos for internal contaminant concentrations and thus helps to develop a better understanding of dose-response relationships. To test this hypothesis, embryos of Danio rerio were exposed to Cd and Zn spiked sediment in different treatments applying an ion exchange resin for modification of bioavailable concentrations. The TXRF analysis indicated individual embryos with dramatically enhanced exposure compared to other individuals despite uniform exposure conditions on a macro scale. Ion exchanger reduced embryo Zn concentrations to values close to control value with a comparably low standard deviation. Cadmium concentrations in embryos were in the range of 4000 to 7000 μg/g with a median of 5740 μg/g. A commercial ion exchanger reduced individual body burdens by a factor 50 to 100. Individual peak body burdens of up to 3160 μg/g were accompanied by reduced weight of the fish eggs due to early death i.e. coagulation. The investigation of exposure and effects on an individual-based scale may significantly help to reduce uncertainty and inconsistencies occurring in conventional analysis of pooled fish embryo samples. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, it is an excellent model for ecotoxicological investigations. The present study aims to assess time and spatial variations of embryo- and proteotoxic effects in surface water and sediment. For this end, embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to Neckar River samples collected in the Tübingen region in different seasons over 2 years. Additionally, quantification of the heat shock (stress) protein Hsp70 was carried out in newly hatched larvae; furthermore, physico-chemical water parameters were measured in order to gain baseline information about the limnologic conditions. Results: Nearly all of the investigated Neckar River sites caused elevated mortality, developmental retardation and failures, modified heart rate and reduced hatching success in zebrafish embryos and larvae. Additionally, exposure to Neckar River water and sediment led to changes in larval Hsp70 level. During the 2 years of investigation, seasonal differences of embryo- and proteotoxic effects occurred. Along these lines, physico-chemical measurements delivered basic information for the interpretation of in vivo test data. Conclusions: Our study suggests a changing toxic burden in the whole investigated study area. Consequently, for ecotoxicological field studies, time and spatial variations on small scale must be dealt with.

For comparison, acetonic extracts were tested using both contact tests and additionally two cell-based biotests for cytotoxicity and Ah receptor-mediated activity (EROD-Assay). The sediment-contact tests were carried out with the dehydrogenase assay with Arthrobacter globiformis and the fish embryo assay with Danio rerio. The results of this study clearly document that native samples may well be significantly more effective than corresponding extracts in the bacteria contact assay or the fish embryo test. These results question the commonly accepted concept that acetonic extracts are likely to overestimate the toxicity of soil and SPM samples. Likewise, the priority organic compounds analyzed failed to fully explain the toxic potential of the samples. The outcomes of this study revealed the insufficient knowledge regarding the relationship between the different exposure pathways.

In the present study, concentration ranges of three PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene, β-naphthoflavone, benzo[k]fluoranthene) as examples of known CYP1A inducers as well as extracts of two well-characterized sediment samples of the lower Neckar river (Southern Germany) were used to determine the suitability of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryo for the in vivo EROD assay. Data for zebrafish embryos were generated for comparison. Fathead minnow embryos were principally suitable to show in vivo EROD induction via live-imaging. Since in fathead minnow embryos both signal area and fluorescence intensities are lower than in zebrafish embryos, the induction potentials of the three model PAHs and the environmental samples proved to be species-dependent. Among the three PAHs tested, benzo[k]fluoranthene lead to the strongest EROD signal followed by β-naphthoflavone and benzo[a]pyrene in comparison to the positive control. Whereas benzo[k]fluoranthene and β-naphthoflavone showed a dose-response relationship for the EROD induction, benzo[a]pyrene failed to induce a significant signal in fathead minnow embryos.

The Fish Embryo Contact Test (FECT) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) was applied and submitted to further development to allow for a comprehensive risk assessment of such complex environmental samples. As particulate pollutants are constructive constituents of sediments, they underlay episodic source-sink dynamics, becoming available to benthic organisms. As bioavailability of xenobiotics is a crucial factor for ecotoxicological hazard, we focused on the direct particle-exposure pathway, evaluating throughput-capable endpoints and considering toxicokinetics. Fish embryo and larvae were exposed toward reconstituted (freeze-dried) sediment samples on a microcosm-scale experimental approach. A range of different developmental embryonic stages were considered to gain knowledge of potential correlations with metabolic competence during the early embryogenesis. Morphological, physiological, and molecular endpoints were investigated to elucidate induced adverse effects, placing particular emphasis on genomic instability, assessed by the in vivo comet assay. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the extent of induced cell death, since cytotoxicity can lead to confounding effects. The implementation of relative toxicity indices further provides inter-comparability between samples and related studies. All of the investigated sediments represent a significant ecotoxicological hazard by disrupting embryogenesis in zebrafish. Beside the induction of acute toxicity, morphological and physiological embryotoxic effects could be identified in a concentration-response manner. Increased DNA strand break frequency was detected after sediment contact in characteristic non-monotonic dose–response behavior due to overlapping cytotoxic effects.

This study used the established zebrafish (Danio rerio) model, its known developmental toxicity endpoints and sensitive molecular analyses to evaluate sediments near and around an industrial effluent site in Bohai Bay. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of rapid biological detection methods as an addition to chemical analyses. Embryos were exposed to various concentrations of sediment extracts as well as a 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) positive control. Exposure to sediment extract nearest the discharge site (P1) resulted in the most severe- and highest rates of change in embryos and larvae, suggesting that DLC contaminated sediment probably did not occur much beyond it. P1 extract resulted in concentration dependent increases in mortality and pericardial edema. Its highest concentration caused up-regulation of P-450 (CYP)-1A1(CYP1A) mRNA expression at 72 h post fertilization (hpf), an increase in its expression in gill arches as observed by whole mount in situ hybridization, and an increased signal in the Tg(cyp1a: mCherry) transgenic line. The pattern and magnitude of response was very similar to that of TCDD and supported the presence of DLCs in these sediment samples. Follow-up chemical analysis confirmed this presence and identified H7CDF, O8CDF and O8CDD as the main components in P1 extract. This study validates the use of biological assays as a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method to evaluate DLCs and their effects in sediment samples. Additionally, it provides support for the conclusion that DLCs have limited remobilization capacity in marine sediments. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.01.116","China",30784797,NA

This study examined the potential of transcriptional endpoints investigated in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to riverbed sediments in ecotoxicity testing. Embryo-larval 10-day tests were conducted on sediment samples collected from five sites (one upstream and four downstream of the city of Milan) along a polluted tributary of the Po River, the Lambro River. Sediment chemistry showed a progressive downstream deterioration in river quality, so that the final sampling site showed up to eight times higher concentrations of, for example, triclosan, galaxolide, PAH, PCB, BPA, Ni, and Pb, compared with the uppermost site. The embryo/larval tests showed widespread toxicity although the middle river sections evidenced worse effects, as evidenced by delayed embryo development, hatching rate, larval survival, and growth. At the mRNA transcript level, the genes encoding biotransformation enzymes (cyp1a, gst, ugt) showed increasing upregulations after exposure to sediment from further downstream sites. The genes involved in antioxidant responses (sod, gpx) suggested that more critical conditions may be present at downstream sites, but even upstream of Milan there seemed to be some level of oxidative stress. Indirect evidences of potential apoptotic activity (bcl2/bax < 1) in turn suggested the possibility of genotoxic effects. The genes encoding for estrogen receptors (erα, erβ1, erβ2) showed exposure to (xeno)estrogens with a progressive increase after exposure to sediments from downstream sites, paralleled by a corresponding downregulation of the ar gene, likely related to antiandrogenic compounds. Multiple levels of thyroid disruption were also evident particularly in downstream zebrafish, as for thyroid growth (nkx2.1), hormone synthesis and transport (tg, ttr, d2), and signal transduction (trα, trβ). The inhibition of the igf2 gene reasonably reflected larval growth inhibitions. Although none of the sediment chemicals could singly explain fish responses, principal component analysis suggested a good correlation between gene transcripts and the overall trend of contamination. Thus, the combined impacts from known and unknown covarying chemicals were proposed as the most probable explanation of fish responses. In summary, transcriptional endpoints applied to zebrafish embryo/larval test can provide sensitive, comprehensive, and timeliness information which may greatly enable the assessment of the hazard potential of sediments to fish, complementing morphological endpoints and being potentially predictive of longer studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","10.1007/s11356-019-07417-8","",31942721,NA

We evaluated if decreased concentrations of sex steroids could work as an in vivo end-point in female zebrafish fed an organic extract of bottom sediments from Molnbyggen. The responsiveness of zebrafish to endocrine alteration was evaluated using a positive control substance, cyproterone acetate (CA), which is known to inhibit steroid biosynthesis.

Sediments in certain areas of the lake are known to be contaminated with high levels of metals and legacy organic chemicals. To improve our understanding of risk to native fish populations, we conducted a study evaluating levels of sediment contamination and potential effects on early life stage fish. Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs were several orders of magnitude higher at two industrial sites (B1 and B2) than at a nearby reference site (IP). Concentrations of 32 metals and metalloids were at least 5-fold higher at B1 and B2 than at IP. Moreover, all available interim sediment quality guidelines (ISQGs) were exceeded at the two contaminated sites, while none were exceeded at the reference site. Biological effects were evaluated using a sediment contact assay. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to clean water (control), or to sediment from IP, B1, and B2 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Mortality was significantly elevated in fish exposed to the B1, but not the B2 sediment. The frequency of deformities increased with increasing contamination, but this trend was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Genes that are implicated in the response to PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and furans (cyp1a, cyp1b1, ahr2) were significantly elevated in the 120 hpf larvae exposed to the B1 and B2 sediments. Global DNA methylation, and mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress (maft, cat, hmox1, sod2), embryonic development (bmp2b, baf60c), metal exposure (mt2), and DNA repair (gadd45b) were unaffected.

Previous studies investigating mass mortalities of crocodile and fish in the river system, revealed the presence of organic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in their tissues. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from nine sites within the dam in winter and summer. Liquid-liquid and microwave-assisted extraction was used for preconcentrating PAHs from water and sediment samples, respectively. Extracts were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode to determine the presence and levels of the 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)-priority PAHs. Results and discussion: Significant levels of PAHs were found in both water and sediment samples. Concentrations were higher in sediments than in water, as well as in samples collected in winter. Levels of PAHs in sediments were generally higher than those reported by many researchers for other water bodies in industrialised areas. Zebrafish embryos were used to assess potential risks associated with the water and sediment, and to determine the effects of PAHs on aquatic life. Embryos, exposed to intact water and sediment samples, as well as to diluted sediment extracts, were monitored for 120 h post fertilisation. Sediment proved more toxic to zebrafish embryos than water, causing delayed embryo development and malformations. Conclusions: These findings are alarming as they indicate that this water system is under stress.

This study was designed to investigate the concentration of DLPCBs in the Zhanjiang coastal sediment and histopathological changes in zebrafish (Diano rerio) embryos exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of DLPCBs. Of the five sites selected, two sites TS and JSW contained DLPCBs at concentrations of 0.08 and 22.54 ng/g dry sediment, respectively. Two groups of zebrafish embryos were used.

The results of this pilot study showed that the presence of tubificids promoted the migration of the trace metals from sediment to overlying water, especially when there were more worms and especially for Cu which is not easily released from the sediment. During the experiment, Cu in overlying water was mainly in particulate fraction. While for Zn, it was mainly in dissolved form in the early stage of the experiment, and then the dominant fraction gradually changed to particulate fraction. The bioturbation of tubificids also promoted the accumulation of both Cu and Zn in the aquatic organisms. In one system, different types of aquatic organisms showed different features for the accumulation of Cu and Zn. Meanwhile, with the presence of different intensity of bioturbation, the concentration of Cu or Zn in the same kind of organism was different. After a 30-day experiment, trace metal concentration in the aquatic organisms generally decreased in the order of floating plants (lesser duckweed) > submerged plants (Amazon sword) > small fish (zebrafish), and the concentration of Zn in the organisms was usually significantly higher than that of Cu in the same organism, especially in duckweed and zebrafish.

Even the most sensitive fish survived days of continuous exposure to suspensions of relatively uncontaminated sediment on the order of grams per litre, and the invertebrates generally survived similar exposures to tens of grams per litre of relatively uncontaminated sediment. Exposure to suspensions of contaminated sediment decreased survival substantially, but, even so, mortality occurred only after exposure to higher concentrations for longer time periods than are created in the water column by the typical dredging operation. Only fingerling striped bass Moronesaxatilis showed a sensitivity great enough to indicate a potential cause for concern from continuous pipeline discharge of highly contaminated dredged material. While water column impacts generally appeared to warrant little concern, the data indicate the potential for impact of contaminated fluid mud on benthic infauna and relatively immobile epifauna. Fluid muds with suspended sediment concentrations of tens of grams per litre can be created on the bottom by pipeline, and perhaps hopper, disposal of hydraulically dredged fine grained sediment. These can persist for sufficient periods to have a potential for impact on relatively immobile bottom dwellers, particularly if highly contaminated sediments are involved.

PFRs can be divided in three main groups, inorganic, organic and halogen containing PFRs. Most of the PFRs have a mechanism of action in the solid phase of burning materials (char formation), but some may also be active in the gas phase. Some PFRs are reactive FRs, which means they are chemically bound to a polymer, whereas others are additive and mixed into the polymer. The focus of this report is limited to the PFRs mentioned in the literature as potential substitutes for BFRs. The physico-chemical properties, applications and production volumes of PFRs are given. Non-halogenated PFRs are often used as plasticisers as well. Limited information is available on the occurrence of PFRs in the environment. For triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), tricresylphosphate (TCP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(chloropropyl)phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), and tetrekis(2-chlorethyl)dichloroisopentyldiphosphate (V6) a number of studies have been performed on their occurrence in air, water and sediment, but limited data were found on their occurrence in biota. Concentrations found for these PFRs in air were up to 47μgm-3, in sediment levels up to 24mgkg-1 were found, and in surface water concentrations up to 379ngL-1. In all these matrices TCPP was dominant. Concentrations found in dust were up to 67mgkg-1, with TDCPP being the dominant PFR. PFR concentrations reported were often higher than polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) concentrations, and the human exposure due to PFR concentrations in indoor air appears to be higher than exposure due to PBDE concentrations in indoor air.Only the Cl-containing PFRs are carcinogenic. Other negative human health effects were found for Cl-containing PFRs as well as for TCP, which suggest that those PFRs would not be suitable alternatives for BFRs. TPhP, diphenylcresylphosphate (DCP) and TCP would not be suitable alternatives either, because they are considered to be toxic to (aquatic) organisms. Diethylphosphinic acid is, just like TCEP, considered to be very persistent. From an environmental perspective, resorcinol-bis(diphenylphosphate) (RDP), bisphenol-A diphenyl phosphate (BADP) and melamine polyphosphate, may be suitable good substitutes for BFRs.Information on PFR analysis in air, water and sediment is limited to TCEP, TCPP, TPhP, TCP and some other organophosphate esters. For air sampling passive samplers have been used as well as solid phase extraction (SPE) membranes, SPE cartridges, and solid phase micro-extraction (SPME).For extraction of PFRs from water SPE is recommended, because this method gives good recoveries (67-105%) and acceptable relative standard deviations (RSDs) (&lt;20%), and offers the option of on-line coupling with a detection system. For the extraction of PFRs from sediment microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is recommended. The recoveries (78-105%) and RSDs (3-8%) are good and the method is faster and requires less solvent compared to other methods.For the final instrumental analysis of PFRs, gas chromatography-flame photometric detection (GC-FPD), GC-nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD), GC-atomic emission detection (AED), GC-mass spectrometry (MS) as well as liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS and GC-Inductively-coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS) are used.

The enzyme inactivation, induced by various inhibitors, leads to acetylcholine accumulation, hyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and disrupted neurotransmission. Hence, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, interacting with the enzyme as their primary target, are applied as relevant drugs and toxins. This review presents an overview of toxicology and pharmacology of reversible and irreversible acetylcholinesterase inactivating compounds. In the case of reversible inhibitors being commonly applied in neurodegenerative disorders treatment, special attention is paid to currently approved drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease, and toxic carbamates used as pesticides. Subsequently, mechanism of irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition induced by organophosphorus compounds (insecticides and nerve agents), and their specific and nonspecific toxic effects are described, as well as irreversible inhibitors having pharmacological implementation. In addition, the pharmacological treatment of intoxication caused by organophosphates is presented, with emphasis on oxime reactivators of the inhibited enzyme activity administering as causal drugs after the poisoning. Besides, organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides can be detoxified in mammals through enzymatic hydrolysis before they reach targets in the nervous system. Carboxylesterases most effectively decompose carbamates, whereas the most successful route of organophosphates detoxification is their degradation by corresponding phosphotriesterases. ©2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","","10.2174/1570159X11311030006","Cholinesterase Inhibitors",NA,NA

Although the five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) share a high degree of sequence homology, they show pronounced differences in G-protein coupling preference and the physiological responses they mediate. Unfortunately, despite decades of effort, no therapeutic agents endowed with clear mAChR subtype selectivity have been developed to exploit these differences. We describe here the structure of the G q/11-coupled M3 mAChR ( M3 receptor', from rat) bound to the bronchodilator drug tiotropium and identify the binding mode for this clinically important drug. This structure, together with that of the G i/o-coupled M2 receptor, offers possibilities for the design of mAChR subtype-selective ligands. Importantly, the M3 receptor structure allows a structural comparison between two members of a mammalian GPCR subfamily displaying different G-protein coupling selectivities. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tiotropium binds transiently to an allosteric site en route to the binding pocket of both receptors. These simulations offer a structural view of an allosteric binding mode for an orthosteric GPCR ligand and provide additional opportunities for the design of ligands with different affinities or binding kinetics for different mAChR subtypes. Our findings not only offer insights into the structure and function of one of the most important GPCR families, but may also facilitate the design of improved therapeutics targeting these critical receptors. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) produce toxicity by inhibiting the cholinesterase enzymes in the nervous system. Monitoring of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been widely used in terrestrial and freshwater aquatic systems as an indicator of OP exposure and effects. This review describes the use of AChE inhibition as a biomarker in the estuarine environment, discusses the relationship between AChE inhibition and other manifestations of OP toxicity, and highlights areas where additional research is needed. A variety of studies with estuarine fish have suggested that brain AChE inhibition levels of >70% are associated with mortality in most species. Selected species, however, appear capable of tolerating much higher levels (>90%) of brain inhibition. Sublethal effects on stamina have been reported for some estuarine fish in association with brain AChE inhibition levels as low as 50%. Most studies suggest, however, that these effects are observed only when brain AChE inhibition is at near-lethal levels. A number of field studies have successfully used AChE inhibition in fish as a biomarker in the estuarine environment. The use of AChE inhibition as a biomarker in estuarine invertebrates has been less well studied. Although AChE inhibition has been measured in the tissues of a variety of invertebrate species following OP exposure, the relationship between AChE inhibition and lethality is less distinct. Additional work is needed in both fish and invertebrates to better explain species-specific differences in the relationship between AChE inhibition and mortality and to investigate other physiological perturbations associated with AChE inhibition.","","10.1002/etc.5620200104","Insecticides",11351414,NA

Therefore, oxidative stress-induced damage to the brain has a strong potential to negatively impact normal CNS functions. Although oxidative stress has historically been considered to be involved mainly in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease, its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression, is beginning to be recognized.

Understanding the neural basis of nicotine-induced anxiolysis can help both with developing better aids for smoking cessation as well as with the potential development of novel nicotinic ligands for treating anxiety. Complementary non-mammalian models may be useful for determining the molecular bases of nicotine effects on neurobehavioral function. The current project examined whether a zebrafish model of anxiety would be sensitive to nicotine. When zebrafish are placed in a novel environment, they dive to the bottom of the tank. In the wild, diving could help to escape predation. We tested the anxiolytic effect of nicotine on the novelty-elicited diving response and subsequent habituation. Zebrafish placed in a novel tank spent the majority of time at the bottom third of the tank during the first minute of a 5-min session and then show a gradual decrease in time spent at the tank bottom. Nicotine treatment at 100 mg/l for 3 min by immersion before testing caused a significant decrease in diving throughout the session, while 50 mg/l was effective during the first minute when the greatest bottom dwelling was seen in controls. Nicotine effects were reversed by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine given together with nicotine, but not when administered shortly before the test session after prior nicotine dosing. This implies that the effect of nicotine on diving was due to net stimulation at nicotinic receptors, an effect that is blocked by mecamylamine; and that once invoked, this effect is no longer dependent on continuing activation of nicotinic receptors. The effect of nicotine on diving did not seem to be the result of a general disorientation of the fish. The 100 mg/ml nicotine dose was shown in our earlier study to significantly improve spatial-discrimination learning in zebrafish. Nicotine-induced anxiolytic effects can be modeled in the zebrafish.

Suppressing Ca2+ transients by photorelease of a Ca2+ chelator accelerates axon extension, whereas mimicking transients with photorelease of Ca2+ slows otherwise rapid axonal growth. The frequency of Ca2+ transients is cell-type specific and depends on the position of growth cones along their pathway. Furthermore, growth-cone stalling and axon retraction, which are two important aspects of pathfinding, are associated with high frequencies of Ca2+ transients.

We previously found that nicotine, which has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans, significantly lessens the novel tank diving response in zebrafish. The specificity of the diving effect was validated with a novel vs. non-novel test tank. The novel tank diving response of zebrafish was tested when given three anxiolytic drugs from two different chemical and pharmacological classes: buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. When the test tank was novel the diving response was clearly seen whereas it was significantly reduced when the test tank was not novel.

Zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been used as a model system for developmental biology for decades. We propose here that it is also an excellent model for studying social behavior. Adult male zebrafish were separated for 5 days and then pairs were formed and allowed to interact for 5 days. Under these conditions, aggression is prevalent and dominant-subordinate relationships are quickly established. Dominant behavior is characterized by a repeated pattern of chasing and biting, whereas subordinates engage in retreats. By day 5, the dominant-subordinate relationship was firmly established and there were differences in behavior over time. Chases, bites and retreats were all less frequent on day 5 of the social interaction than on day 1. Arginine vasotocin is the teleostean homologue of arginine vasopressin, a neuropeptide whose expression has been linked to aggression and social position in mammals.

Dominant individuals express vasotocin in one to three pairs of large cells in the magnocellular preoptic area whereas subordinate individuals express vasotocin in 7-11 pairs of small cells in the parvocellular preoptic area.

Thigmotaxis was significantly attenuated by anxiolytic (diazepam) and significantly enhanced by anxiogenic (caffeine) drugs, thus representing the first validated thigmotaxis assay for larval zebrafish. We also show that exposure to sudden darkness per se may represent an anxiogenic situation for larval zebrafish since less contrasting light-to-darkness transitions (achieved by lowering darkness degrees) significantly decreased thigmotaxis levels in a manner similar to what was achieved with diazepam. These findings suggest that stimuli such as exposure to sudden darkness could be used proficiently to trigger the expression of anxiety-like behaviors in laboratory settings. In sum, this is a versatile protocol allowing testing of both anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs in a cost-effective manner (only 10. min). This assay is also amenable to medium to high-throughput capacity while constituting a valuable tool for stress and central nervous system research as well as for preclinical drug screening and discovery. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","","10.1016/j.bbr.2011.12.016","",22197677,NA

Methods: This study enrolled 667 children at nine elementary schools in five South Korean cities. A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on neuropsychological tests were obtained from both the children and their mothers. Results: We measured mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), both metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), in urine samples. The geometric mean (ln) concentrations of MEHP, MEOHP, and MBP were 21.3 μg/L [geometric SD (GSD) = 2.2 μg/L; range, 0.5-445.4], 18.0 μg/L (GSD = 2.4; range, 0.07-291.1), and 48.9 μg/L (GSD = 2.2; range, 2.1-1645.5), respectively. After adjusting for demographic and developmental covariates, the Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ scores were negatively associated with DEHP metabolites but not with DBP metabolites. We also found a significant negative relationship between the urine concentrations of the metabolites of DEHP and DBP and children's vocabulary subscores. After controlling for maternal IQ, a significant inverse relationship between DEHP metabolites and vocabulary subscale score remained. Among boys, we found a negative association between increasing MEHP phthalate concentrations and the sum of DEHP metabolite concentrations and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children vocabulary score; however, among girls, we found no significant association between these variables. Conclusion: Controlling for maternal IQ and other covariates, the results show an inverse relationship between phthalate metabolites and IQ scores; however, given the limitations in cross-sectional epidemiology, prospective studies are needed to fully explore these associations.","","10.1289/ehp.0901376","Only Child;Child;Intelligence",20194078,NA

PFOS induced cell death at 24hpf was consistently found in the brain, eye, and tail region of embryos. PFOS exposure induced lesions in the muscle fibers with histological examination. Behavior assessment of PFOS in zebrafish embryos elevated the basal rate of swimming after 4 days of exposure, and larvae exposed to PFOS (0.25-4mg/L) for only 1h at 6dpf swam faster with increasing PFOS concentration.

In this study, a fast and high throughput LC-MS/MS method was developed. For the first time, all the twelve OPEs that have been studied in literature, ranging from the very polar and volatile trimethyl phosphate to the very hydrophobic and non-volatile tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, were separated within 11. min. Different from previous studies, we found that the blank contamination was mainly from organic mobile phase rather than the enrichment process, and it can be efficiently eliminated by using acetonitrile rather than methanol as the organic phase of the mobile phase. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) was significantly improved by using 0.1% formic acid as an organic modifier. The method exhibited high throughput and sensitivity and can baseline separate 11 of the 12 OPEs studied within 11. min with LOQs ranging from 2 to 6. ng/L. The relative standard deviations were in the range of 2-10%. For both reagent water and river water, the spiked recoveries of OPEs ranged from 70 to 110%, except for the very polar and volatile trimethyl phosphate that has recovery below 10%.

To assess the onset of these behaviours, we first manipulated the early social environment of larval zebrafish subjects, giving them three model shoaling partners of the same pigment phenotype. We then assayed the subjects' preferences using binary preference tests in which we presented subjects with two shoals, one shoal of fish showing the same pigment pattern phenotype as their models and another shoal with a radically different pigment pattern. To determine whether the visually mediated preference could be altered once it was established, we further manipulated the social environment of a number of subjects, rearing them with one model shoal and testing them, then changing their social consorts and retesting them. Our results show that larval zebrafish shoal early in their development, but do not show a shoaling preference until they are juveniles. Moreover, we found that the shoaling preference was stable, as changing the social environment of fish after they had acquired a preference did not change their preference.

The long-term consequences of exposure have become a major human health concern as research has indicated strong associations between neurotoxicants and a variety of dopamine-related neurological disorders. Developmental exposure to pesticides including paraquat, organochlorines, and rotenone produce alterations in the dopaminergic system and has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Endocrine disrupters such as Bisphenol A, mimic estrogenic activity and impact various dopaminergic processes to enhance mesolimbic dopamine activity resulting in hyperactivity, attention deficits, and a heightened sensitivity to drugs of abuse. A second class of endocrine disrupters, the polychlorinated biphenyls, may act directly on dopaminergic processes to disrupt the dopamine system and produce Parkinson-like symptoms. Exposure to the heavy metal lead enhances dopaminergic activity and has been associated with attention deficits, Alzheimer's disease, and increased drug sensitivity. Manganese exposure, in contrast, results in dopamine deficiencies and Parkinson-like symptoms. Therefore, this commentary will discuss the effects and consequences that exposure to these three classes of environmental neurotoxicants have on the dopamine system and related behaviors and disorders.

Hardly any data on its chemical pollution by polar organic pollutants are available in literature. This study focused on the presence and sources of a series of phenolic endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in this area, including parabens, alkylphenolic compounds and bisphenol-A (BPA). A number of possible sources of pollution are present in the area, including the large harbours present in the lagoon, the city of Aveiro and the rivers discharging into the area. A recently constructed submarine wastewater outfall, located a few kilometres from the lagoon inlet has also been suggested as a possible source of pollution to Ria de Aveiro in several publications. The aim of the current field study was to investigate the occurrence and main sources of phenolic endocrine disruptors in Ria de Aveiro. Materials and methods: An extensive sampling campaign was performed, with surface water and wastewater grab samples taken at over 50 locations, in duplicate on different days. Samples were treated using solid phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results and discussion: Concentrations in lagoon water were generally low: not exceeding 20 ng/L for most analytes. Levels in river water exceeded those in the lagoon by a factor 3 to 500 (o-phenylphenol (PhP) and nonylphenoxy ethoxy acetic acids (A9PEC), respectively), with concentrations up to 700 ng/L for BPA and 7,300 ng/L for A9PEC. Samples from the harbours showed EDC levels similar to those in the rest of the lagoon, but in the city of Aveiro, elevated concentrations were observed for alkylphenol ethoxylates (A9PEO), A9PEC, PhP and BPA. Wastewater effluents showed low levels for parabens, whilst alkylphenolic compounds reached several micrograms per litre. The effluents are discharged into the ocean via a submarine outfall, but as marine water near the outfall showed slightly elevated concentrations only for A9PEO, it does not seem to be a significant source of these EDCs for the area. Conclusions: All the studied phenolic EDCs were detected in the study area, with high levels found in some of the rivers discharging into the lagoon, and generally low concentrations in the lagoon itself. The main sources for all investigated EDCs were the rivers Caster and Antuã which discharge into the lagoon. The city of Aveiro was identified as a secondary source. As the tidal water exchange volume is much larger than the freshwater input from the rivers, concentrations of phenolic EDCs remained low in the lagoon. © 2009 The Author(s).","","10.1007/s11356-009-0275-5","Portugal;Phenols;Phenol",20017000,NA

Human FAS has been modeled in laboratory animals including the zebrafish. Recently, embryonic exposure to low doses of ethanol has been shown to impair behavior without any gross morphological alterations in zebrafish. The exposed zebrafish showed reduced responses to animated conspecific images. The effect of embryonic ethanol exposure, however, has not been investigated in a real shoal and the potential mechanisms underlying the behavioral impairment are also unknown. Here we show that a 2. h long immersion in 0.25% and 0.50% (vol/vol) alcohol at 24. h post fertilization significantly increases the distance among members of freely swimming groups of zebrafish when measured at 70. days post fertilization. We also show that this impaired behavior is accompanied by reduced levels of dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin and 5HIAA as quantified by HPLC from whole brain extracts. Our results demonstrate that even very low concentrations of alcohol applied for a short period of time during the development of zebrafish can impair behavior and brain function. We argue that the observed behavioral impairment is not likely to be due to altered performance capabilities, e.g. motor function or perception, but possibly to social behavior itself. We also argue that our neurochemical data represent the first step towards understanding the mechanisms of this abnormality in zebrafish, which may lead to better modeling of, and ultimately perhaps better therapies for human FAS. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2011.05.009","Ethanol",21658445,NA

However, the number of behavioral test paradigms specifically designed for zebrafish, and in general the amount of information available on the behavior of this species, is relatively small when compared with classical laboratory model organisms such as the mouse, the rat, and the fruit fly. A particularly typical behavioral feature of zebrafish is shoaling, i.e., group formation. Given the importance of social behavior in our own species and the fact that zebrafish possess several characteristics similar to those of other vertebrates, including humans, at many levels of biological organization (e.g., neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, biochemical processes, and amino acid sequence of proteins or nucleotide sequence of genes), the zebrafish is expected to be an excellent tool not only for basic research but perhaps also for translational research. Briefly, we propose that once social behavior of the zebrafish is better characterized and once appropriate behavioral methods have been developed, this species can be utilized for the analysis of the mechanisms of social behavior of other vertebrates including our own. In this review, we discuss general principles of shoaling and highlight what we know and what we do not know about this behavior as it pertains to zebrafish.

Asan Lake is one of the largest artificial lakes in Korea, and is surrounded by industrial complex and farmlands. The PEs were found to be present throughout the study area. The mean concentration of total PEs (∑14 PEs) was 3.92–33.09 ng/m3 in air, not detected (n.d.)-2.29 μg/L in water, 3.6–8973 μg/kg dry weight (dw) in sediment, and n.d.-1081 μg/kg dw in fish, respectively. The most frequently detected phthalate in the samples was di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and followed by di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). The concentrations of PEs in water and sediment samples tended to decrease moving downstream of Asan Lake. Bioaccumulation of PEs showed that benthic feeding fish such as crucian carp or skygager contained higher levels of DEHP. Partitioning of DEHP and DBP between water and sediment was calculated using paired sediment/water samples and fugacity fraction (ff). High ff value (ff = 0.89 ± 0.1) of DBP and low ff value of DEHP (ff = 0.24 ± 0.1) confirmed that DEHP is the most abundant PEs in the sediment, and DBP is the second most abundant PEs except DEHP in water.

In Japan, the amount of organophosphate flame retardants used in 2001 was about five times more than in 2000. Recently, several studies have shown the health concerns for some organophosphate flame retardants. Little research has been performed on the emission of organophosphate flame retardants, especially the relationship between content and emissions. In this study, a new type of passive sampler was developed to measure emissions of organophosphate flame retardants from plastic materials. With this sampler, emissions from polyvinyl chloride wallpaper samples with different content of tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCPP) at different temperatures were examined. The observed maximum emissions of TCPP from 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 w/w% content wallpaper materials were 262.3, 452.6, 644.8, 1119.1 and 2166.8 μg m-2 h-1, respectively. Emissions from 5% TCPP content materials at 40 and 60 °C were 1135.7 and 2841.2 μg m-2 h-1, respectively. A significantly positive correlation between the flux of TCPP and the TCPP content of the wallpaper samples was observed. A linear relationship was found between the inverse of temperature and the logarithm of TCPP emission. The results imply that the use of materials with a high organophosphate flame retardant content can lead to high emission rates in high-temperature indoor environments. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we use strain differences among zebrafish, Danio rerio, as an experimental tool to test the effects of social experience on behavior. By manipulating the strain composition of groups in which the subject fish are housed at different ages, we tested (1) whether mixing with dissimilar individuals influenced subsequent behavior, (2) whether prolonged mixing during the juvenile stage had a more pronounced effect than a shorter period of mixing during adulthood and (3) whether mixing had a lasting effect after animals were resorted into groups of same strain animals. We found that social experience had a profound impact on social behavior. Both Nadia and TM1 individuals engaged in more frequent biting after having been in mixed strain groups compared to pure strain groups. This was true of groups mixed as juveniles, as well as adults, indicating that this response was not dependent on exposure during a critical developmental period. Also, TM1 fish (but not Nadia) having recently been housed in mixed-strain groups were more willing to leave the immediate vicinity of a shoal than were TM1 fish raised in pure strain groups. This change was more pronounced in groups mixed as juveniles than as adults. In addition, the observed changes persisted after mixed groups were separated into pure strain groups for a month.

In the present study, the biochemical exposure biomarker acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) inhibition was related to locomotor behavior, representing a general effect biomarker at the organismal level. Both sexes of the carabid beetle Pterostichus cupreus were intoxicated with three doses of the organophosphorous insecticide dimethoate. Five elements of their locomotor behavior were measured for 4 h employing computer-aided video tracking, whereupon the whole body AChE activity was measured in the individual beetle. AChE inhibition was strongly correlated with dimethoate dose in both sexes. Alterations in the locomotor behavior were directly correlated with AChE inhibition in male beetles, which responded by reducing the time in locomotion, average velocity, and path length and by increasing the turning rate and frequency of stops. Females responded similarly at the two highest doses, whereas their locomotor behavior was not significantly different from the control group at the lowest dimethoate dose, suggesting a sex-dependent difference in behavioral sensitivity to minor AChE depressions. The results demonstrate that automated measurements of locomotor behavior is at least as sensitive an endpoint to organophosphate poisoning as the AChE assay. Further, the correlation between the molecular and behavioral responses in individual beetles indicates a mechanistic relationship between the two biomarkers.","","10.1897/1551-5028(1997)016<1727:AIAALB>2.3.CO;2","Biological Markers",NA,NA

AChE first appeared in the nervous system in the primary motoneurons of the rostral spinal cord when the embryo had nine somites, approximately 14 hours postfertilization. Subsequent expression of AChE activity in the spinal cord proceeded in a rostral‐to‐caudal sequence. Cranial neurons expressed AChE activity shortly after it appeared in the rostral spinal cord. Several hours later, near the end of the first day, primary neurons in the hindbrain and spinal cord all contained AChE, including sensory neurons, reticulospinal interneurons, and primary motoneurons. AChE activity was also detected in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Presumptive cranial ganglia transiently expressed AChE activity between 14 and 24 hours of development. These results, combined with previous observations that examined the time of origin and axogenesis of primary neurons, suggest that primary neurons in the embryonic zebrafish contain AChE before they sprout axons. The primary neurons appear to follow a common sequence of development consisting of a withdrawal from the cell division cycle, the expression of AChE, and axogenesis. Although this sequence is followed by all primary neurons, lack of a rostral‐to‐caudal sequence in the time of birth and variability in the time of axon outgrowth demonstrate that the relative timing of these three events is not rigidly programmed in individual neurons. Moreover, the very early expression of AChE in such diverse cell types suggests that it may have a developmental role in addition to its function in transmitter metabolism. Copyright © 1989 Alan R.

However, little information is so far available regarding the joint toxicity of type I and type II pyrethroids to fish. Zebrafish is a well-accepted aquatic vertebrate model for toxicity assessment due to small size, easy husbandry, high fecundity and transparent embryos. In this study, we utilized embryo-larval zebrafish to elucidate the combined effects of sublethal concentrations of permethrin (PM) and cypermethrin (CP), which are the most frequently used type I and type II pyrethroids, respectively. Fish were exposed from 3h postfertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf to binary mixtures of nominal concentrations of 100, 200, 300μgL-1 PM (PM100, PM200, PM300) and 10, 20, 30μgL-1 CP (CP10, CP20, CP30). Analytical data of the real concentrations of the chemicals showed a significant degradation of the pyrethroids but an obvious recovery after the renewal of the exposure solution. Defect rates of embryos exposed to these low concentrations of single PM or CP exhibited no statistically significant difference from the control, while the application of combination of PM and CP resulted in deleterious effects on zebrafish embryonic development. In all PM200 and PM300 exposure groups, increasing CP concentrations acted additively to the action of PM in terms of all sublethal endpoints. Co-treatment of embryos with the specific sodium channel blocker MS-222 and pyrethroids (individuals or the mixture) caused a decline in the incidences of body axis curvature and spasms compared to treatment of animals with pyrethroids alone, suggesting that the developmental toxicity of PM and CP to zebrafish was related to disruption of ion channels. We further revealed that mixture of the two pyrethroids caused greater down-regulation in the mRNA levels of proneural genes. The individual pesticides had no effect on the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), while the mixture exposure caused significant induction. Treatment with CP or the mixture increased the activity of catalase (CAT). Taken together, our data indicated that the mixture of PM and CP caused higher incidence of morphological defects, greater inhibition in proneural gene expression and more oxidative stress, compared to the single chemical at the corresponding doses. Our findings suggest that the combination of type I and type II pyrethroids poses a greater risk to fish in the water column. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.10.014","",24184047,NA

The goal of new insecticide development is to more effectively kill target species with fewer toxic side effects on non-target species. From the experience with the developmental neurotoxicity caused by the generations of insecticides developed in the past advice is offered how to proceed with future insecticide development to decrease neurotoxic risk. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","","10.1016/j.envint.2016.11.019","Insecticides",27908457,NA

Growing research has also shown that dopamine acts as an important regulator of immune function. Many immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopamine related proteins, enabling them to actively respond to dopamine and suggesting that dopaminergic immunoregulation is an important part of proper immune function. A detailed understanding of the physiological concentrations of dopamine in specific regions of the human body, particularly in peripheral systems, is critical to the development of hypotheses and experiments examining the effects of physiologically relevant dopamine concentrations on immune cells. Unfortunately, the dopamine concentrations to which these immune cells would be exposed in different anatomical regions are not clear. To address this issue, this comprehensive review details the current information regarding concentrations of dopamine found in both the central nervous system and in many regions of the periphery. In addition, we discuss the immune cells present in each region, and how these could interact with dopamine in each compartment described. Finally, the review briefly addresses how changes in these dopamine concentrations could influence immune cell dysfunction in several disease states including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as the collection of pathologies, cognitive and motor symptoms associated with HIV infection in the central nervous system, known as NeuroHIV. These data will improve our understanding of the interactions between the dopaminergic and immune systems during both homeostatic function and in disease, clarify the effects of existing dopaminergic drugs and promote the creation of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulating immune function through dopaminergic signaling.

The behavior of the exposed fish is compared to controls in a large (91. cm diameter) circular tank in which shoals of 8 subjects under the same treatment are allowed to swim freely. Several measures of shoaling are quantified including the nearest neighbour distance (NND), inter-individual distance (IID), swimming speed, polarization (a measure of the directional synchronization of the shoal), and the number and duration of excursions (departures from the shoal). Alcohol and nicotine were both found to exert significant effects on shoaling but impaired the behavior in different ways. For example, alcohol strongly disrupted polarization and only modestly reduced shoal cohesion, while nicotine had only a modest effect on polarization but robustly decreased shoal cohesion. Neither drug affected the number or the duration of excursions, but both reduced swimming speed.

It has recognized activity as an endocrine-disrupting chemical and has suspected roles as a neurological and reproductive toxicant. It interferes in steroid signaling, induces oxidative stress, and affects gene expression epigenetically. Gestational, perinatal and neonatal exposures to BPA affect developmental processes, including brain development and gametogenesis, with consequences on brain functions, behavior, and fertility. Methods: This review critically analyzes recent findings on the neuro-toxic and reproductive effects of BPA (and its analogues), with focus on neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, glia and microglia activity, cognitive functions, and the central and local control of reproduction. Results: BPA has potential human health hazard associated with gestational, peri- and neonatal exposure. Beginning with BPA’s disposition, this review summarizes recent findings on the neurotoxicity of BPA and its analogues, on neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, neuro-degeneration, and impairment of cognitive abilities. Furthermore, it reports the recent findings on the activity of BPA along the HPG axis, effects on the hypothalamic Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), and the associated effects on reproduction in both sexes and successful pregnancy. Conclusion: BPA and its analogues impair neuronal activity, HPG axis function, reproduction, and fertility. Contrasting results have emerged in animal models and human. Thus, further studies are needed to better define their safety levels. This review offers new insights on these issues with the aim to find the “fil rouge”, if any, that characterize BPA’s mechanism of action with outcomes on neuronal function and reproduction. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","","10.2174/1570159X17666190726112101","",31362658,NA

BPA-induced neurotoxicity occurs with the generation of oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and cognitive dysfunctions. However, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of the effects of BPA on autophagy and association with oxidative stress and apoptosis are still elusive. We observed that BPA exposure during the early postnatal period enhanced the expression and the levels of autophagy genes/proteins. BPA treatment in the presence of bafilomycin A1 increased the levels of LC3-II and SQSTM1 and also potentiated GFP-LC3 puncta index in GFP-LC3-transfected hippocampal neural stem cell-derived neurons. BPA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were mitigated by a pharmacological activator of autophagy (rapamycin). Pharmacological (wortmannin and bafilomycin A1) and genetic (beclin siRNA) inhibition of autophagy aggravated BPA neurotoxicity. Activation of autophagy against BPA resulted in intracellular energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) activation, increased phosphorylation of raptor and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and decreased phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser-757), and silencing of AMPK exacerbated BPA neurotoxicity. Conversely, BPA exposure down-regulated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by phosphorylation of raptor as a transient cell's compensatory mechanism to preserve cellular energy pool. Moreover, silencing of mTOR enhanced autophagy, which further alleviated BPA-induced reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis. BPA-mediated neurotoxicity also resulted in mitochondrial loss, bioenergetic deficits, and increased PARKIN mitochondrial translocation, suggesting enhanced mitophagy. These results suggest implication of autophagy against BPA-mediated neurodegeneration through involvement of AMPK and mTOR pathways.

The adult zebrafish is a suitable model organism to examine anxiety-like behaviors since it presents neurotransmitter systems and behavioral functions evolutionary conserved. Anxiety in zebrafish can be measured by different tasks, analyzing the habituation to novelty, as well as the response to brightly lit environments.

Among these factors, both polydopamine (PDA) and dopamine (DA) monomer have recently been reported to increase osteoblast proliferation and mineralization in vitro. Although a well-characterized neurotransmitter, DA’s role in the bone is unknown. We hypothesize that DA can directly act on osteoblasts, and examined whether osteoblasts express DA receptors that respond to exogenous DA. mRNAs and protein cell lysates were obtained from MC3T3-E1 cells during osteogenic differentiation phase. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of DA receptors, D1–D5. Dose-response effect and time course of DA treatment on cell proliferation, mineralization, and osteogenic differentiation were investigated at pre-determined days. Real-time PCR was performed to investigate whether DA affects osteogenic gene expression (ALP, BSP, OC, OSX, RUNX2, and Collagen1a2) with or without receptor antagonists (SCH233390 and GR103691). Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. All five DA receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) mRNAs and proteins were expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. DA treatment increased cell proliferation for up to 7 days (P < 0.05). Osteogenic mineralization was significantly greater in the DA-treated group than control group (P < 0.05). Finally, expression of all the osteogenic genes was inhibited by DA receptor antagonists for D1, D3, and D5. Our findings suggest that MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts express functional DA receptors that enhance proliferation and mineralization.

Dyes are of particular concern as contaminants of the aquatic environment, since their toxicity remain poorly understood. Thus, the current study was designed to assess the effects induced by the synthetic azo dye Basic Red 51 (BR51) and by the natural naphthoquinone dye erythrostominone (ERY) on zebrafish early life stages (Danio rerio) at different biological organization levels, i.e., studying how changes in biochemical parameters of important physiological functions (neurotransmission and cellular energy allocation) may be associated with behavior alterations (swimming activity). This approach was also used to assess the effects of ERY after its photodegradation resulting in a colorless product(s) (DERY). Results showed that after 96 h exposure to BR51 and Ery, zebrafish embryos consumed less energy (LOEC = 7.5 mg/L), despite the unaltered levels of available energy (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins). Hence, cellular energy allocation (CEA) was significantly increased. On the other hand, only ERY decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity (LOEC = 15 mg/L). Despite that, zebrafish larvae exposed to both dyes until 144 h were less active. In contrast, DERY did not affect any parameter measured. These results indicate an association between a decrease consumption of energy and decrease swimming activity resulting from an environmental stress condition, independently of the neurotoxicity of the dyes. Degradation of ERY by light prevented all toxic effects previously observed, suggesting a cheap, fast and easy alternative treatment of effluents containing this natural dye. All tools assessed in our current study were sensitive as early-warning endpoints of dyes toxicity on zebrafish early life stages, and suggest that the CEA assay might be useful to predict effects on locomotor activity when cholinergic damage is absent. Energy balance is associated with locomotor activity of zebrafish early life stages: dyes decreased the energy consumption, compromising energy allocation to swimming activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","","10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.020","",29291525,NA

Impairment of the cognitive performances such as learning and memory is frequently observed in epileptic patients. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are efficient to the majority of patients. However, 30% of this population seems to be refractory to the drug treatment. These patients are not seizure-free and frequently they show impaired cognitive functions. Unfortunately, as a side effect, some AEDs could contribute to such impairment. The major problem associated with conducting studies on epilepsy-related cognitive function is the lack of easy, rapid, specific and sensitive in vivo testing models. However, by using a number of different techniques and parameters in the zebrafish, we can incorporate the unique feature of specific disorder to study the molecular and behavior basis of this disease. In the view of current literature, the goal of the study was to develop a zebrafish model of epilepsy induced cognitive dysfunction. In this study, the effect of AEDs on locomotor activity and seizure-like behavior was tested against the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced seizures in zebrafish and epilepsy associated cognitive dysfunction was determined using T-maze test followed by neurotransmitter estimation and gene expression analysis. It was observed that all the AEDs significantly reversed PTZ induced seizure in zebrafish, but had a negative impact on cognitive functions of zebrafish. AEDs were found to modulate neurotransmitter levels, especially GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine and gene expression in the drug treated zebrafish brains. Therefore, combination of behavioral, neurochemical and genenetic information, makes this model a useful tool for future research and discovery of newer and safer AEDs. © 2017 Kundap, Kumari, Othman and Shaikh.","","10.3389/fphar.2017.00515","Epilepsy;Cognition",NA,NA

Member states are required to identify chemical pollutants of significance in the water bodies, to establish emission control measures, and to achieve quality standards. A specific category of pollutants are the compounds that may possess endocrine-related functions known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). This means that member states have the obligation to take action in order to prevent human exposure to these compounds via aquatic environment. The objective of this research was to study the occurrence and distribution of phenolic and steroid EDCs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged in the area of Thermaikos Gulf, Thessaloniki, Northern Greece. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from three rivers, four streams, and four municipal and industrial wastewaters from the area of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece, during the period 2005-2006. The samples were analyzed for 14 EDCs (nonylphenol, octylphenol, their mono- and di-ethoxylate oligomers, bisphenol A, estrone, 17α-estradiol, 17β-estradiol, estriol, mestranol, and 17α-ethynylestradiol). The compounds were recovered by solid phase extraction and ultrasonic extraction from the dissolved phase and particulate phase, respectively, and determined by employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Results revealed the presence of phenolic EDCs (NP, NP1EO, NP2EO, tOP, OP1EO, OP2EO, and BPA) in all water and wastewater samples. Steroid EDCs were not found at detectable concentrations. The relationships between field partition coefficients of EDCs and concentration of total suspended solids, dissolved, and particulate organic carbon were investigated. Discussion: Rivers exhibited concentrations of EDCs similar to minimally impacted surface waters worldwide. The concentrations of NP and OP occasionally exceeded the environmental quality criteria proposed for inland waters. The concentrations of EDCs in streams exhibited wide variations due to low flow rate in these systems and the impact of wastewaters from various pollution sources. Wastewater from tannery activities showed extremely high concentrations of NP, whereas relatively high concentrations of EDCs were determined in effluents from the industrial wastewater treatment plant. Field partition coefficients of EDCs are negatively correlated with concentrations of total suspended solids and dissolved organic carbon and positively correlated with particulate organic carbon. Conclusions: The examined rivers (Aliakmon, Axios, and Loudias) exhibited concentrations of EDCs similar to minimally impacted surface waters worldwide. However, special attention should be paid to these systems since the concentrations for NP and OP occasionally were above the proposed quality standards, revealing the impact of urban, industrial, and agricultural activities. High concentrations of EDCs were determined in streams, urban, and industrial wastewater posing significant risk to the aquatic environment they discharged. Recommendations and perspectives: The occurrence of EDCs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged to Thermaikos Gulf results in an increased risk to the marine environment. Thus, these systems should be regularly monitored, especially for NP, OP, and BPA that are considered as priority hazardous compounds in the Water Framework Directive. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","","10.1007/s11356-009-0172-y","Greece",19495820,NA

By using automatic behaviour tracking technology, locomotion of developing zebrafish (ZF) larvae can be accurately recorded and potentially used in an ecotoxicological context to detect toxicant-induced behavioural alterations. In this study, we explored if and how quantitative locomotion data can be used for sub-lethal toxicity testing within the FET framework. We exposed ZF embryos to silver ions and nanoparticles, which previously have been reported to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity and behavioural retardation in early-life stages of ZF. Exposure to a broad range of silver (Ag+ and AgNPs) concentrations was conducted, and developmental toxicity was assessed using FET criteria. For behavioural toxicity assessment, locomotion of exposed ZF eleutheroembryos (120 hpf) was quantified according to a customised behavioural assay in an automatic video tracking system. A set of repeated episodes of dark/light stimulation were used to artificially stress ZF and evoke photo-motor responses, which were consequently utilized for locomotion profiling. Our locomotion-based behaviour profiling approach consisted of (1) dose-response ranking for multiple and single locomotion variables; (2) quantitative assessment of locomotion structure; and (3) analysis of ZF responsiveness to darkness stimulation. We documented that both silver forms caused adverse effects on development and inhibited hatchability and, most importantly, altered locomotion. High Ag+ and AgNPs exposures significantly suppressed locomotion and a clear shift in locomotion towards inactivity was reported. Additionally, we noted that low, environmentally relevant Ag+ concentrations may cause subordinate locomotive changes (hyperactivity) in developing fish. Overall, it was concluded that our locomotion-based behaviour-testing scheme can be used jointly with FET and can provide endpoints for sub-lethal toxicity. When combined with multivariate data analysis, this approach facilitated new insights for handling and analysis of data generated by automatized behavioural tracking systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.01.013","Locomotion",26867187,NA

The original results were inconclusive as the control group showed a directional and color preference. To assess directional preference further, a three-chambered testing apparatus was constructed and rotated in several directions. The directional preference observed in males was alleviated by rotating the arms pointing west and east. In addition, color preference was investigated using all combinations of five different colors (orange, yellow, green, blue and purple). With directional preference alleviated results showed that both male and female zebrafish preferred colors of shorter wavelengths. An additional experiment tested changes in color preference due to developmental exposure to Pb in adult male zebrafish. Results revealed that Pb-exposed males gained and lost certain color preferences compared to control males and the preference for short wavelengths was decreased. Overall, these results show that consideration and pretesting should be completed before applying behavioral and learning assays involving adult zebrafish to avoid innate preferences and confounding changes in neurotoxicology studies and that developmental Pb exposure alters color preferences in adult male zebrafish. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","10.1002/jat.3169","Color",25993913,NA

This study reports that toxicologic effects of combined DKA (FQs-TCs) exposure on zebrafish were comparable with or slightly less than those of TCs alone, showing that TCs played a major toxicologic role in the mixtures. The effects of FQs, TCs, and DKAs on malformation rates of zebrafish were dose dependent, with EC50 values of 481.3, 16.4, and 135.1 mg/L, respectively. According to the combined effects of DKAs on zebrafish hatching, mortality, and malformation rates, the interaction between FQs and TCs was shown to be antagonistic based on three assessment methods: Toxic Unit, Additional Index, and Mixture Toxic Index. The 1.56 mg/L TC and 9.38 mg/L DKA treatments resulted in higher zebrafish basal swimming rate compared with the control group at 120 hours postfertilization (hpf). in both light and light-to-dark photoperiod experiments. Under conditions of no obvious abnormality in cardiac development, the heart beats were decreased significantly because of DKA exposure, such as decreasing by ∼20% at 150 mg/L DKAs. Transmission electron microscopy observation of myocytes from DKA-exposed hearts displayed prominent interruptions and myofibrillar disorganization of the normal parallel alignment of thick and thin filaments, and partial edematous and dissolved membranes of cell nuclear tissues. At 90 mg/L DKAs, the transcriptional levels of the acta1a, myl7, and gle1b genes, related to heart development and skeletal muscle formation, were significantly changed. This is consistent with the swimming behavior and histopathologic results obtained by transmission electron microscopy.

Quercetin up to 10 μg/L did not induce significant mortality in developing fish, but did increase prevalence of an upward-curved dorsal plane in hatched larvae. To determine whether this developmental defect was potentially related to mitochondrial bioenergetics during development, we measured oxygen consumption rate in whole embryos following a 24-hour exposure to quercetin. Basal mitochondrial and ATP-linked respiration were decreased at 1 and 10 μg/L quercetin, and maximal respiration was decreased at 10 μg/L quercetin, suggesting that quercetin impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics. This is proposed to be related to the deformities observed during development. Due to the fact that ATP production was affected by quercetin, larval behaviors related to locomotion were investigated, as well as transcriptional responses of six myogenesis transcripts. Quercetin at 10 μg/L significantly reduced the swimming velocity of zebrafish larvae. The expression levels of both myostatin A (mstna) and myogenic differentiation (myoD) were also altered by quercetin. Mstna, an inhibitory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 1 μg/L quercetin exposure, while myoD, a stimulatory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 10 μg/L quercetin exposure. There were no changes in transcripts related to apoptosis (bcl2, bax, casp3, casp7), but we did observe a decrease in mRNA levels for catalase (cat) in fish exposed to each dose, supporting an oxidative stress response.

Considering that zebrafish is a suitable vertebrate to assess agonistic behaviors using noninvasive protocols, we investigate whether TAU modulates EtOH-induced aggression in zebrafish using the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test. Since body color can be altered by pharmacological agents and may be indicative of emotional state, we also evaluated the actions of EtOH and TAU on pigment response. Fish were acutely exposed to TAU (42, 150, and 400 mg/L), EtOH (0.25%), or cotreated with both molecules for 1 h and then placed in the test apparatus for 6 min. EtOH, TAU 42, TAU 400, TAU 42/EtOH and TAU 400/EtOH showed increased aggression, while 150 mg/L TAU only increased the latency to attack the mirror. This same concentration also prevented EtOH-induced aggression, suggesting that it antagonizes the effects of acute alcohol exposure. Representative ethograms revealed the existence of different aggressive patterns and our results were confirmed by an index used to estimate aggression in the MIA test. TAU did not alter pigment intensity, while EtOH and all cotreated groups presented a substantial increase in body color. Overall, these data show a biphasic effect of TAU on EtOH-induced aggression of zebrafish, which is not necessarily associated with changes in body color. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.All rights reserved.","","10.1016/j.pbb.2015.11.011","Ethanol;Taurine;Aggression",26631619,NA

The risks of the pesticides in surface water and sediment were assessed using a first-tier risk quotient (RQ) approach. The higher-tier PERPEST model was used to refine the ecological risks of pesticides when RQ indicated a potential risk. Results showed the most frequently detected pesticides that appeared in high concentrations were chlorpyrifos, diazinon and quinalphos in surface water and sediment. The highest concentration of OPPs measured in water was 9.1 μg chlorpyrifos/L (median of 1.95 μg/L), while this was 51 μg diazinon/kg dw (median of 11 μg/kg dw) for sediment. Furthermore, results showed high acute and/or chronic RQs (RQ > 1) in surface water and sediment for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, quinalphos, malathion and fenitrothion.

We then tested aggression and avoidance (i.e., hiding) levels of fish from each developmental treatment in both environments. Developmental environment was a significant source of variation in avoidance behavior while the stimulus environment did not influence avoidance. Without a period of acclimation we found that EBEHAV and an EDEV X EBEHAV interaction were both significant sources of variation.

The toxicity of styrene is potentiated by treatment with phenobarbital, β-naphthoflavone, or pyridine. Since the toxicity of styrene is generally associated with its metabolism to styrene oxide (SO), the formation of SO by hepatic and pulmonary microsomes of NSA and CD-I mice was measured to examine correlations with toxicity. Both enantiomers of SO were quantified since the R-SO enantiomer is more toxic than the S-SO enantiomer. No strain differences in rates of styrene metabolism or enantiomeric ratio were observed in control mice or mice treated with inducers. Pyridine, an inducer of CYP2E I, increased S-SO but not R-SO formation in liver. Phenobarbital, an inducer of CYP2B, increased the production of both enantiomers. β-Naphthoflavone, an inducer of CYP1A, had no effect. None of the inducers had any effect in lung. Addition of the CYP2E1 inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate decreased the formation of both enantiomers in both tissues from control mice, whereas 5-phenyl-l-pen-tyne (an inhibitor of CYP2F2) inhibited metabolism primarily in lung. In both control and phenobarbital-treated mice, SKF525A inhibited both R-SO and S-SO in liver but only S-SO in lung.

Studies on mammals indicate that exposures to some chemicals during embryonic development at concentrations that do not produce anatomical malformations may nevertheless produce behavioral deficits later in life, an example of delayed effects. There have been reports of delayed effects in aquatic organisms. Delayed behavioral effects of mercury, chlorinated and other pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some synthetic hormones in the environment have been reported in fishes and invertebrates; in some cases behavioral effects are manifested years after the exposure. Another type of delayed behavioral effect results from exposure of mature females before fertilization (maternal exposure). Even when embryos and larvae are reared in clean water, offspring may manifest abnormal behaviors following maternal exposure. The reported behavioral changes are generally deleterious and compromise the fitness of the animal in its natural environment. Delayed effects and their impacts on fitness are not considered in standard short-term embryo bioassays, which will therefore underestimate neurotoxicity.

Behavioral and biochemical alterations after Cu exposure have also been described at concentrations close to the allowed limits. Aiming to search for the effects of Cu in the range of the allowed limits, larvae and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations of dissolved Cu (nominally: 0, 5, 9, 20 and 60 μg/L; measured: 0.4, 5.7, 7.2 16.6 and 42.3 μg/L, respectively) for 96 h. Larvae swimming and body length, and adult behavior and biochemical biomarkers (activity of glutathione-related enzymes in gills, muscle, and brain) were assessed after Cu exposure. Several effects were observed in fish exposed to 9 μg/L nominal Cu, including increased larvae swimming distance and velocity, abolishment of adult inhibitory avoidance memory, and decreased glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in gills of adult fish. At the highest Cu concentration tested (nominally: 60 μg/L), body length of larvae, spatial memory of adults, and gill GST activity were decreased. Social behavior (aggressiveness and conspecific interaction), and glutathione reductase (GR) activity were not affected in adult zebrafish. Exposure to Cu, at concentrations close to the water quality criteria for this metal in fresh water, was able to alter larvae swimming performance and to induce detrimental effects on the behavior of adult zebrafish, thus indicating the need for further studies to reevaluate the currently allowed limits for Cu in fresh water. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10. mg. dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227 transcripts (p<0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin. Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell processes and diseases affected by dieldrin.

The larvae were harvested at 120h postfertilization, and the impact on dopaminergic signaling was investigated. The results revealed significant reductions in content of whole-body dopamine and its metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, in DE-71-exposed larvae. The transcription of genes involved in the development of dopaminergic neurons (e.g., manf, bdnf, and nr4a2b) was significantly downregulated upon exposure to DE-71. Also, DE-71 resulted in a significant decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels in dopaminergic neurons. The expression level of tyrosine hydroxylase in forebrain neurons was assessed by whole-mount immunofluorescence, and the results further demonstrated that the tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression level was reduced in dopaminergic neurons. In addition to these molecular changes, the authors observed reduced locomotor activity in DE-71-exposed larvae. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that acute exposure to PBDEs can affect dopaminergic signaling by disrupting the synthesis and transportation of dopamine in zebrafish, thereby disrupting normal neurodevelopment.

It is well established that 4-NP can affect the development of aquatic animals by disrupting the endocrine signals. Here we show for the first time in zebrafish that 4-NP does not only target the neuroendocrine system but also the notochord and the muscle. The notochord malformation was first evident as distortions at 24hourspostfertilization (hpf) which within 24h appeared as kinks and herniations. The notochord phenotype was accompanied by reduced motility and impaired swimming behavior. Whole-mount in situ hybridization using chordamesoderm markers and electron microscopic analysis showed failure in the notochord differentiation and disruption of the perinotochordal basement membrane. Late larval stages of 4-NP treated embryos displayed abnormal mineralization, vertebral curvature, fusion of vertebral bodies and abnormal extension of haemal arches. The muscle structure and the maximal active force in isolated muscle preparations were similar between 4-NP exposed and of control embryos, suggesting that 4-NP did not induce major changes in striated muscle function. However, repeated electrical stimulation (&gt;40Hz) of the 4-NP exposed larvae revealed an impaired relaxation between stimuli, possibly reflecting an alteration in the relaxant mechanisms (e.g. in cellular Ca 2+ removal) which could explain the abnormal swimming pattern exhibited by 4-NP exposed larvae. Additionally, we demonstrate that the expression levels of the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing hormonewere elevated in the brain following 4-NP treatment. We also observed a significant decrease in the transcript levels of luteinizing hormone b at early larval stages. Collectively, our results show that 4-NP is able to disrupt the notochord morphogenesis, muscle function and the neuroendocrine system. These data suggest that 4-NP enduringly affects the embryonic development in zebrafish and that this compound might exert these deleterious effects through diverse signaling pathways. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","","10.1016/j.ntt.2011.09.009","",22002180,NA

The exact CNS action of TCAs remains poorly understood, necessitating new screening approaches and novel model organisms. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a promising tool for pharmacological research of antidepressants, including amitriptyline. Here, we examine the effects of chronic 2-week exposure to 10 and 50 μg/L amitriptyline on zebrafish behavior and monoamine neurotransmitters. Overall, the drug at 50 μg/L evoked pronounced anxiolytic-like effects in the novel tank test (assessed by more time in top, fewer transition and shorter latency to enter the top). Like other TCAs, amitriptyline reduced serotonin turnover, but also significantly elevated whole-brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels. The latter effect was not reported in this model previously, and accompanied higher brain expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis), but unaltered expression of dopamine-β-hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase (the enzymes of dopamine metabolism). This response may underlie chronic amitriptyline action on dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission, and contribute to the complex CNS profile of this drug observed both clinically and in animal models.

In the first part of this study, synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX) (2-200. mg/L for 24. h) was used to induce stress effects in the zebrafish larvae from 4 to 5. days post-fertilisation (dpf) and the effect of DEX administration on zebrafish larvae on anxiety-like behaviour during adulthood in novel tank test was investigated. Next, the possible protective effect of caffeine pre-treatment (5-50. mg/L for 24. h from 3 to 4. dpf) before DEX administration was studied. DEX-treated adult male zebrafish showed higher anxiety levels in behavioural tests, as seen in longer latency to enter the top part of the tank, lower transition numbers between the top and bottom parts with more time spent at the bottom and lesser time spent at the top and lower distance travelled at top part. The effect of DEX on anxiety-like behaviour was dose-dependent. Importantly, adult male zebrafish pre-treated with caffeine before DEX treatment did not show any anxiety-like behaviour.

Hence, we have investigated these EDCs in water samples from Ganga and Sundarban wetland of India. Since these compounds exhibit estrogenic potential, we have further measured steroids and evaluated the estrogenic activity (estradiol equivalents, BioE2Eqs) using an in-vitro bioassay (E-Screen). Further BioE2Eqs were compared with the sum of predicted estradiol equivalents based on the chemical concentrations of PAEs and BPA by E-Screen (ChemE2Eq) and YES factors (ChemYES). Caffeine was measured as a marker for anthropogenic wastewater discharge. Results showed that the highest BioE2Eq (below the lowest observable effect of E2 on fish) was associated with sites having sewer outfalls in the middle stretch of the river, and concomitantly coinciding with the elevated concentrations of caffeine. Neither ChemE2Eq nor ChemYES correlated with measured BioE2Eqs.

Triclosan exposed group showed significantly reduced locomotion concomitant with increased freezing duration. They also showed erratic movements suggesting that triclosan induced anxiety-like behavior in adult zebrafish. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the anxiety-like behavior is linked to altered acetylcholinesterase activity. We found that the triclosan exposure decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain and skeletal muscle but acetylcholinesterase (ache) gene was significantly down-regulated only in the skeletal muscle of the adult zebrafish exposed to triclosan.

This hypothesis article investigates the role of estrogen (and also EDCs) in the brain and how it influences the Ca2+ pathway. Ca2+ and its movement in and out of the cell is an extremely important ion controlling normal cell physiology. Any dysfunction in the movement from outside to inside the cell or between organelles may have fundamentally negative effects and the disturbance may even lead to apoptosis and/or necrosis. Therefore we consider whether estrogen and EDCs may alter the Ca2+ physiology and whether these changes may be one of the main causes of interference in physiology that is seen when humans and animals are exposed to EDCs. We come to the conclusion that on a molecular level Ca2+ and Ca2+ fluxes ([Ca2+]i, endocrine disrupting chemicals, redox modulation, mitochondria and cytochrome c followed by apoptosis, necrosis or most likely aponecrosis may contribute to chemical-mediated developmental toxicity.

In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/L nano-TiO2 and 1.0 mg/L micro-TiO2 for up to 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Exposure to 1.0 mg/L nano-TiO2 significantly decreased the body length and weight of zebrafish larvae; however, the hatching and mortality rate of zebrafish embryos did not change. Behavioral tests showed that nano-TiO2 exposure significantly reduced the swimming speed and clockwise rotation times of the larvae. The results revealed that nano-TiO2 treatment adversely affected motor neuron axon length in Tg (hb9-GFP) zebrafish and decreased central nervous system (CNS) neurogenesis in Tg (HuC-GFP) zebrafish. Additionally, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that genes associated with neurogenesis (nrd and elavl3) and axonal growth (α1-tubulin, mbp, and gap43) were significantly affected by nano-TiO2 exposure. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that early-life stage exposure of zebrafish to nano-TiO2 causes adverse neural outcomes through the inhibition of neurodevelopment and motor neuron axonal growth. © 2020","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142315","Titanium;Axons",33254858,NA

Zebrafish were treated with Rho (1, 3, and 5 µg/L) for nine consecutive days and were subsequently subjected to Sco (100 µM) 30 min before behavioral tests (novel tank diving test, Y-maze, and novel object recognition tests). Rho was isolated from Chorisia crispiflora (Malvaceae) leaves and identified by different spectroscopic techniques. To further assess the possible mechanisms of Rho in enhancing the memory capacities in zebrafish, the in vivo antioxidant status and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also evaluated. Rho from Chorisia crispiflora leaves was identified. Rho could alleviate anxiety, memory deficits, and brain oxidative stress in Sco-treated zebrafish and could regulate the cholinergic function by inhibiting the AChE activity. Our results demonstrated that Rho could be a promising candidate compound against anxiety and amnesia by restoring the cholinergic activity and the amelioration of brain oxidative stress. © 2020 by the authors.

In humans and animals, KYNA regulates affective and cognitive responses, acting mainly as an antagonist of glutamatergic receptors. However, the complete psychopharmacological profile of KYNA (which includes the activity of several neurotransmitter receptors) is poorly understood, and merit further studies. Aquatic models are rapidly emerging as useful tools in translational psychopharmacology research. Here, we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to exogenous KYNA for 20 min, and assessed their behavior in the novel tank test. Exposure to KYNA (20 mg/L) in this paradigm evoked overt effects in fish, including decreased latency to enter the top half of the tank, increased number of top entries and longer top duration. In contrast, locomotor activity indices (swimming distance and velocity) were not affected by KYNA in this study. Overall, our results show KYNA has an anxiolytic-like pharmacological effect in zebrafish, and therefore strongly support the utility of zebrafish models in neurotropic drug screening, including drugs acting at central glutamatergic system. Robust phenotypic differences evoked by KYNA, revealed here using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion in X, Y and time (Z) coordinates, confirm this notion, also demonstrating the value of 3D-based phenotyping approaches for high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish models. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the developmental toxicity of monoHAcAms was evaluated in embryo-larval stage of zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to one concentration of 2.50, 5.00, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0 and 80.0 mg/L monoHAcAms from 4 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. Multiple endpoints, including hatching rate, morphological abnormalities, mortality as well as locomotor behavior were assessed at specified stages (24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hpf). Results showed that 80 mg/L CAcAm and 40 mg/L BAcAm significantly decreased the hatching rate, IAcAm decreased the hatching rate and delayed the hatching process in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 16.37 mg/L at 72 hpf. The frequency and severity order of morphological abnormalities increased with the raised exposure concentrations and prolonged exposure time, and the corresponding EC50 at 96 hpf were 21.10, 9.77 and 16.60 mg/L for CAcAm, BAcAm and IAcAm, respectively. MonoHAcAms exposure resulted in a time- and dose-dependent response in mortality and the calculated LC50 at 72 hpf were 38.44, 17.74 and 28.82 mg/L for CAcAm, BAcAm and IAcAm, respectively.

Here we provide evidence that mutation of the scg2a and scg2b genes using TALENs in zebrafish reduces sexual behavior, ovulation, oviposition, and fertility. Large-scale spawning within-line crossings (n = 82 to 101) were conducted. Wild-type (WT) males paired with WT females successfully spawned in 62% of the breeding trials. Spawning success was reduced to 37% (P = 0.006), 44% (P = 0.0169), and 6% (P &lt; 0.0001) for scg2a−/−, scg2b−/−, and scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− mutants, respectively. Comprehensive video analysis indicates that scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− mutation reduces all male courtship behaviors. Spawning success was 47% in saline-injected WT controls compared to 11% in saline-injected scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− double mutants. For these mutants, spawning success increased 3-fold following a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of synthetic secretoneurin-a (P = 0.0403) and increased 3.5-fold with injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Embryonic survival at 24 h remained on average lower in scg2a−/−;scg2b−/− fish compared to WT injected with secretoneurin-a (P &lt; 0.001). Significant reductions in the expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 3 in the hypothalamus, and luteinizing hormone beta and glycoprotein alpha subunits in the pituitary provide evidence for disrupted hypothalamo-pituitary function in scg2a and scg2b mutant fish.

The 'gene editing revolution' has offered unprecedented opportunities to investigate candidate genes responsible for critical behaviors. Here, we edited the androgen receptor gene (AR), which is associated with male reproductive behavior in zebrafish, using TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), and tested whether modifications at the AR impacted courtship during mating trials. We reveal that males lacking AR courted females significantly less, showing reduced levels of stereotypic behaviors.

The primary drive upon this system comes from hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurosecretory cells, which receive afferent inputs from other neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system to result in the proper coordination of reproduction and the environment. Here, we hypothesized that the recreational drug (±)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy'), which acts through several of the neurotransmitter systems that affect GnRH neurons, suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal reproductive axis of male rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered saline or MDMA either once (acute) or for 20 days (chronic) and were euthanized 7 days following the last administration. We quantified hypothalamic GnRH mRNA, serum luteinizing hormone concentrations, and serum testosterone levels as indices of hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal functions, respectively. The results indicate that the hypothalamic and gonadal levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are significantly altered by MDMA, with GnRH mRNA and serum testosterone levels suppressed in rats administered MDMA compared to saline. Furthermore, our finding that hypothalamic GnRH mRNA levels are suppressed in the context of low testosterone concentrations suggests that the central GnRH neurosecretory system may be a primary target of inhibitory regulation by MDMA usage.

Furthermore, exposure to the highest concentration of BPS and E2 induced a significant decrease in fear-related responses. The impaired anxiety and reduced fear-related responses were associated with a down-regulation in the transcription of genes involved in enzymatic antioxidant defense.

Analyzed SOCs include compounds of current and past use with different sources (i.e., current and historic-use pesticides, industrial and urban-use compounds, and combustion by-products) and chemical properties (i.e., volatility, water solubility, and persistence in the environment). Most banned chemicals such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroetanes (DDTs), aldrins, most polybromodiphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, endosulfans, triazine, and simazine were detected in consistently low concentrations. In contrast, chemicals still in use such as BDE-209, terbutilazine, diuron, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos were found in higher and more variable amounts. Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were high as compared to previous studies in other Pyrenean and European lakes suggesting airborne pollution from nearby anthropogenic sources. Overall, levels of hexacyclohexanes (HCHs) during most of the sampling period were low according to other studies in similar environments. However, the Sabocos water mass recorded a concentration peak of some HCH isomers in summer 2014 related with the HCH residues transfer operation at the nearby (20 km) Bailín landfill site (Sabiñánigo, Spain). © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","10.1007/s11270-015-2648-3","",NA,NA

The few behavioral studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on fish behavior have yielded highly inconsistent results, likely relating to chronic vs. acute treatment. A few studies report lethargy and decreased exploratory behavior, while others indicate increased anxiety and greater exploratory behavior with PAH exposure.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of moderate ELS by exposing young animals (6-weeks postfertilization), for 3 consecutive days, to three stressors, and analyzing the impact of this on adult zebrafish behavior (16-week postfertilization). The ELS impact in adults was assessed through analysis of performance on tests of unconditioned memory (free movement pattern Y-maze test), exploratory and anxiety-related task (novel tank diving test), and social cohesion (shoaling test). Here, we show for the first time that moderate ELS increases the number of alternations in turn-direction compared to repetitions in the unconditioned Y-maze task, suggesting increased working memory, but has no effect on shoal cohesion, locomotor profile, or anxiety-like behavior.

One of the most common is Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disease associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons, among other neuropathological characteristics. In this review, the development of the zebrafish’s dopaminergic system, focusing on genetic control of the dopaminergic system, is detailed.

The circadian rhythms of behavioural processes in zebrafish are known to enable effective utilization of energy and resources, therefore attracting interest in zebrafish as a research model. This review covers a variety of circadian behaviours in this species, including diurnal rhythms of spawning, feeding, locomotor activity, shoaling, light/dark preference, and vertical position preference. Changes in circadian activity during zebrafish ontogeny are reviewed, including ageing-related alterations and chemically induced variations in rhythmicity patterns. Both exogenous and endogenous sources of inter-individual variability in zebrafish circadian behaviour are detailed. Additionally, we focus on different environmental factors with the potential to entrain circadian processes in zebrafish. This review describes two principal ways whereby diurnal behavioural rhythms can be entrained: (i) modulation of organismal physiological state, which can have masking or enhancing effects on behavioural endpoints related to endogenous circadian rhythms, and (ii) modulation of period and amplitude of the endogenous circadian rhythm due to competitive relationships between the primary and secondary zeitgebers. In addition, different peripheral oscillators in zebrafish can be entrained by diverse zeitgebers. This complicated orchestra of divergent influences may cause variability in zebrafish circadian behaviours, which should be given attention when planning behavioural studies. © 2020 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","10.1111/brv.12678","Circadian Rhythm",NA,NA

The studies also showed that lincomycin hydrochloride increased oxidative stress level, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, ATPase activity and apoptosis in zebrafish larvae. In addition, the swimming behavior of zebrafish larvae decreased with the increase of lincomycin hydrochloride concentration, but the angular velocity and meandering degree increased, which might be due to the decreased activity of AChE and ATPase, as well as the decreased expression of genes related to neurodevelopment and neurotransmitter system, leading to the change of their motor behaviors.

Urban and industrial regions are of special concern due to their high population density and their increased exposure to chemical pollution, many times enhanced by chemical production, application or irregular dumping. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of OCPs in outdoor air of urban sites from two major regions of southeast Brazil. Some of these sites have been affected by OCP production and their irregular dumping. Deterministic and probabilistic inhalation cancer risk (CR) assessments were conducted for the human populations exposed to OCPs in ambient air. Ambient air was mainly affected by Ʃ-HCH (median = 340 pg m−3) and Ʃ-DDT (median = 233 pg m−3), the only two OCPs registered for domissanitary purposes in Brazil. OCP concentrations tended to be higher in summer than in winter. Dumping sites resulted in the highest OCP atmospheric concentrations and, thus, in the highest CR estimations.

TBT has been also reported to enhance anxiety in several fish species, whereas the mechanism underlying remains largely unknown. To investigate the disruption of TBT on fish anxiety and the mechanisms possibly involved, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with TBT (100 and 500 ng/L) for 28 days and anxiety behavior was further investigated using a novel tank dive test. Result showed that TBT treatment significantly enhanced the total time of the fish spent in the lower half, delayed the onset time to the higher half of the tank and increased the total duration of freezing of the fish, indicating an enhanced anxiety in TBT-treated fish. Accordingly, TBT sharply elevated the cortisol levels in plasma in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated cortisol level might be involved in the enhanced anxiety. Although the expression of crha was significantly increased and crhbp was significantly decreased in the brain of TBT-treated fish which is consistent to the elevated cortisol level, the expressions of actha and acthb were sharply down-regulated. In contrast, the expressions of genes responsible for the synthesis and action of serotonin (5-HT) (pet1, thp2 and htr1aa), dopamine (DA) (th1, slc6a3, drd2a and drd2b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (gad2 and gabrg2) were all significantly inhibited.

Plastic pollution is globally distributed across the world due to its properties of buoyancy and durability. A big health hazard is the sorption of toxicants to plastic while traveling through the environment. Two broad classes of plastic-related chemicals are of critical concern for human health—bisphenols and phthalates. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disruptor compound (EDC) with estrogenic activity. It is used in the production of materials that are used daily. The endocrine modulating activity of BPA and its effects on reproductive health has been widely studied. BPA also has effects on the immune system; however, they are poorly investigated and the available data are inconclusive. Phthalates are also EDCs used as plasticizers in a wide array of daily-use products. Since these compounds are not covalently bound to the plastic matrix, they easily leach out from it, leading to high human exposure. These compounds exert several cell effects through modulating different endocrine pathways, such as estrogen, androgen, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and arylhydrocarbon receptor pathways. The exposure to both classes of plastic derivatives during critical periods has detrimental effects on human health. Methods: In this review, we have compiled the most important of their perinatal effects on the function of the immune system and their relationship to the development of different types of cancer. Results/Conclusion: The administration of bisphenols and phthalates during critical stages of development affects important immune system components, and the immune function; which might be related to the development of different diseases including cancer. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","10.1002/bdr2.1779","Only Child;Child;Immune System",32767490,NA

Teflubenzuron is an in-feed pharmaceutical applied to control lice outbreaks; the standard medication is 10 mg per kg fish per day for seven days.

To date, there is no information on sub-lethal effects of teflubenzuron on, for example, behavior. We conducted an experiment to assess possible difference in the shelter seeking behavior of teflubenzuron-exposed (N = 19) vs. not exposed (N = 19) H. gammarus juveniles. The teflubenzuron-exposed juveniles had been given very low concentrations, 1.7 µg per pellet twice per week for 113 days prior to this experiment. The concentration of teflubenzuron was estimated to be less than 1 ng/g lobster when they were tested in the behavior experiment. Animals were placed in a lane with a shelter at one end. Once a lobster had found and entered the shelter, they were repeatedly displaced back to the opposite end of the lane, for a total of 3 repeated runs per animal. Three of the exposed juveniles failed to settle in the shelter, and the remaining teflubenzuron-exposed animals took significantly more time to explore the environment and to find and recognize shelter. Furthermore, exposed lobsters also exhibited slower walking speed compared to the controls. These results demonstrate that teflubenzuron significantly reduces exploratory behavior, learning and activity of juvenile H. gammarus.

The objective of our study is to elucidate the impact of OC stress on behavioral alterations and neurodegenerative phenotypes on exposure to B[a]P in zebrafish. We demonstrate the effects of OC stress (12 fish/L) on acute waterborne exposure to B[a]P (0.2 mg L−1) in adult wild zebrafish. Anxiety-like behavior, learning, and memory impairment were assayed by novel tank diving test, light/dark preference test, and T-maze test. Oxidative stress bio-markers were assayed along with histopathological changes in zebrafish brain. OC stress significantly impaired the learning ability and mood behavior by increasing the number of transition and time spent in the alter zones. Increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation with significant decreased catalase activity and reduced glutathione level showed oxidative stress on exposure to OC stress and B[a]P.

A T-maze test was tentatively adopted to assess the effects of BMAA on the learning and memory ability of zebrafish. Interestingly, N. awatschensis was testified to be capable of accumulating free soluble BMAA from bathing seawater through a biological filtration pathway (max. 110.6 μg g−1 wet weight). BMAA was transferred quickly from viscus to muscle and head tissues of zebrafish after intraperitoneal administration of 16.3 μg BMAA per individual twice in two weeks. BMAA accumulated mainly as the total soluble form in both experimental organisms. Results do not support the hypothesis that free BMAA molecules can be largely incorporated into protein in aquatic animals. Behavior of zebrafish in the T-maze test demonstrated that the short-term learning and memory ability was negatively impacted to some degree after three-days exposure to BMAA.

The Guinea pig is considered to have inherently hyperresponsive airways, thus, cross-species validation is needed to confirm relevance to humans. Additionally, sex differences in asthma incidence have been demonstrated in the human population, but whether OP-induced AHR is sexdependent has not been systematically studied in a preclinical model. In this study, 8-week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered CPF at doses causing comparable AChE inhibition in whole lung homogenate (30 mg/kg in males, 7 mg/kg in females, sc) prior to assessing pulmonary mechanics in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d or 14 d post-exposure in males, and 24h or 7 d post-exposure in females. CPF significantly potentiated vagally induced airway resistance and tissue elastance at 7 d post-exposure in males, and at 24h and 7 d postexposure in females. These effects occurred independent of significant AChE inhibition in cerebellum, blood, trachealis, or isolated airway, suggesting that AChE independent OP-induced airway hyperreactivity is a cross-species phenomenon.

Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations (2 mM, 4 mM, 8 mM, 16 mM, 32 mM) INH for 120 hpf. During the exposure period, the percentage of embryo/larva mortality, hatching, and morphological malformation were checked every 24 h until 120 hpf. The development of blood vessels in the brain was observed at 72 hpf and 120 hpf, and behavioral capacity and acridine orange (AO) staining were measured at 120 hpf. Alterations in the mRNA expression of apoptosis and dopamine signaling pathway related genes were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: INH considerably inhibited zebrafish embryo hatching and caused zebrafish larval malformation (such as brain malformation, delayed yolk sac absorption, spinal curvature, pericardial edema, and swim bladder defects). High concentration of INH (16 mM, 32 mM) even induced death of zebrafish. In addition, INH exposure markedly restrained the ability of the zebrafish autonomous movement, shortened the length of dopamine neurons and inhibited vascular development in the brain. No obvious apoptotic cells were observed in the control group, whereas considerable numbers of apoptotic cells appeared in the head of INH-treated larvae at 120 hpf. PCR results indicated that INH significantly raised the transcription levels of caspase-3, -8, -9, and bax and significantly decreased bcl-2 and bcl-2/bax in the zebrafish apoptotic signaling pathway.

In this study, we firstly explored the possible predominant pathway underlying the neuronal apoptotic induced by the BDE-153 treatment in rat cerebral cortex, by measuring expression levels (mRNA and protein) of p53, caspase-3, 8, 9, calpain-1, and calpain-2, detected the levels (protein contents and mRNA) of neurotrophins including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), and measured acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChaT) activities in rat cerebral cortex and primary neurons following BDE-153 treatment with or without pretreatment with inhibitors. Results showed that the neuronal apoptosis induced by BDE-153 was dependent on p53, and dependent on more calpain-2 than caspase-3 in the cerebral cortex of rats. Following the BDE-153 treatment, the protein contents and mRNA levels of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-4, as well as the AchE and ChaT activities were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex and primary neurons when compared to the untreated group. When pretreated primary neurons with calpain inhibitor PD150606 or cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk5, the downstream complex of calpain) inhibitor Roscovitine, the neurotrophins contents and activities of ChaT and AchE were reverted, along with the improvement of neuron survival compared with BDE-153 treatment alone. We conclude that neurotrophins and cholinergic enzymes were regulated by the calpain-2 activation and its downstream cdk5 pathway, and which was involved in the neuronal apoptosis induced by the BDE-153 treatment. © 2018","","10.1016/j.toxlet.2018.03.033","Ethers;Nerve Growth Factors",29621559,NA

BSP patients and matched controls had comparable age at menopause, and there was no correlation between age at menopause and age at BSP onset. Thus, menopause probably exerts no significant influence on the age-dependent development of BSP. BSP cases tended to have a later menarche than either group of controls. The association was independent of age, disease duration and education level. Because the higher the age at menarche, the higher the age at BSP onset, later menarche was unlikely to be a risk factor for BSP. Rather, the two conditions may share pathophysiologic mechanisms, for example minor abnormality of neurotransmitter systems controlling both the motor system and the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis responsible for the onset of puberty.

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were used for 32 days exposure and 32 days depuration. The concentration ratios of syn-DP to total DP (fsyn values) in fish examined were lower than that in commercial products. Rate constants of uptake (kS) and elimination (ke) for the syn- and anti-DP were calculated using a first-order kinetic model. The uptake rate constants of syn- and anti-DP were 0.63 and 0.89 day−1, respectively. The depuration rate constants of syn-DP (0.11 day−1) were similar to anti-DP (0.096 day−1), suggesting that anti-DP is absorbed faster than syn-DP by common carp.

Major part of my thesis is focused on investigating toxic effects and mechanisms of action of one such environmental pollutant, glyphosate, a non-selective herbicide. In this thesis, mechanistic toxicology of sodium benzoate (SB), a common food preservative, has also been investigated. I have used zebrafish vertebrate animal model for toxicity studies included in my thesis and therefore I have also established a zebrafish research lab at IITH. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide. Results included in my thesis indicate significant acute toxicity in zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate concentrations 50 {\textmu}g/mL and above. LD50 for glyphosate was calculated to be 66.04 {\textpm} 4.6 {\textmu}g/mL after 48 hours of exposure. Developmental toxicity due to glyphosate was also observed as physical malformations in zebrafish embryos such as yolk sac edema, pericardial edema, body bending and eye defects. Glyphosate induced cardiotoxicity above 50 {\textmu}g/mL concentrations as indicated by reduced heartbeat of zebrafish embryos in a dose and time dependent manner. To analyze heartbeat, we developed a simple yet powerful method of heartbeat analysis from the untethered, unanesthetized and unlabeled zebrafish larva using ImageJ (open-source) software. We named our semi-automatic method as ZebraPace for Zebrafish Precise Algorithm for Cardiac-rhythm Estimation. Our method is truly cost-effective, uses algorithm which involves fewer steps without the requirement of cumbersome image processing and programming steps. It is also highly reproducible across researchers. The decrease in the heartbeat of zebrafish embryos upon exposure to glyphosate was accompanied by a reduction in the gene expression of cacna1c (L-type calcium channel) and ryr2a (Ryanodine receptor) indicating alterations in the proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and calcium signaling. A change in calcium signaling upon glyphosate exposure was also evident by the upregulation of hspb11 gene (heat shock protein) in our experiments. Of note, hspb11 has been used as a marker to detect changes in cytosolic calcium. Therefore, taken together our results indicate that glyphosate may be inducing cardiotoxicity by changes in calcium signaling. In addition, in our experiments, glyphosate reduced the generation of nitric oxide (NO). NO signaling and calcium signaling are tightly linked and any alteration in one will lead to changes in the other. Glyphosate exposure to adult zebrafish resulted in a reduced reproduction potential indicated by less number of successful mating between treated zebrafish. We observed developmental defects and cardiotoxicity in the progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to glyphosate at a concentration of 10 {\textmu}g/mL. It is important to note that, the obtained progeny was not exposed to glyphosate. Taken together, these results indicate that glyphosate induced toxicity can be carried to the next generation. Swimming behaviour was also affected in adult zebrafish exposed to glyphosate at a concentration of 10 {\textmu}g/mL. The speed of swimming was increased which was interrupted with long durations of freezing in between as compared to control adult fishes. Treated adult zebrafish also showed anxiety-like behaviour as indicated by reduced exploration of the center of the open field test tank. I have also investigated mechanistic toxicology of SB. Results included in my thesis indicate that SB induced biochemical (oxidative stress) and behavioural (anxiety-like behaviour) abnormalities in developing zebrafish larva. LD50 of SB induced toxicity was approximately 400 ppm after 48 hours of SB exposure. Our data strongly supports harmful effects of SB at increasing doses and suggests caution in the excessive use of this preservative in processed and convenience foods. Overall, results in my thesis indicate that both glyphosate and SB can cause significant toxicity and we suggest caution in the excessive use of chemicals which have the potential to cause toxicity.}","","{Biotechnology};Animals;Animal Shells",NA,NA

However, occupational exposure to rotenone has been implicated in the development of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. To explore the mechanism of dopamine neuron death secondary to rotenone exposure, the zebrafish was used as a live animal screening tool for environmentally-induced Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. After testing a variety of small molecule compounds on embryonic zebrafish for their potential to cause dopamine neuron loss, we identified that rotenone exposure induces a bradykinetic dopamine neuron loss phenotype. This phenotype was characterized by decreased locomotion, sensory insensitivity, and a transient but marked decrease in the number of dopamine neurons in embryos exposed to 100nM rotenone, with a concomitant decrease in dopamine transporter mRNA levels. The dopamine neuron deficits were observed in the subpallium, pretectum, olfactory bulb, but these losses were most pronounced in the ventral diencephalon after rotenone exposure. Rotenone damages the mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequently induces ROS-mediated apoptosis in these dopamine neurons. The rotenone-induced dopamine neuron loss and locomotion phenotypes could be partially rescued in zebrafish larvae with ascorbic acid co-treatment during rotenone exposure. Adults raised from zebrafish embryos exposed to rotenone did not show any deficits to their dopamine neuron distribution, but did show anxiety-like behaviors and upregulation of dopamine receptor D1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that rotenone exposure can cause dopamine neuron death through ROS- mediated apoptosis, and supports an environmental cause of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. ￼La roténone est un pesticide disponible dans le commerce et utilisé pour une variété d{\textquoteright}usages industriels.

Chemical similarities between OP pesticides and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), a class of compounds growing in use and environmental relevance, have produced concern regarding whether developmental exposures to OPFRs and OP pesticides may share behavioral outcomes, impacts on dopaminergic systems, or both. Methods: Using the zebrafish animal model, we exposed developing fish to two OPFRs, TDCIPP and TPHP, as well as the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos, during the first 5 days following fertilization. From there, the exposed fish were assayed for behavioral abnormalities and effects on monoamine neurochemistry as both larvae and adults. An experiment conducted in parallel examined how antagonism of the dopamine system during an identical window of development could alter later life behavior in the same assays. Finally, we investigated the interaction between developmental exposure to an OPFR and acute dopamine antagonism in larval behavior. Results: Developmental exposure to all three OP compounds altered zebrafish behavior, with effects persisting into adulthood. Additionally, exposure to an OPFR decreased the behavioral response to acute D2 receptor antagonism in larvae. However, the pattern of behavioral effects diverged substantially from those seen following developmental dopamine antagonism, and the investigations into dopamine neurochemistry were too variable to be conclusive. Thus, although the results support the hypothesis that OPFRs, as with OP pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, may present a risk to normal behavioral development, we were unable to directly link these effects to any dopaminergic dysfunction.}","","{Zebrafish};Organophosphates",NA,NA

Epidemiological studies have suggested that environmental causes may exist, as evidenced by the association between the onset of these disorders and risk factors like exposures to pesticides and lead, both of which can target the dopaminergic nervous system. In light of these suspected associations, a need exists for the development of a screen for dopaminergic toxicity so that potential hazardous chemicals can be identified. This work describes a model of dopaminergic dysfunction using larval zebrafish. Specifically, behavioral analyses following acute exposure to dopaminergic drugs and toxicants are detailed, in addition to the effects of developmental lesioning on behavior and dopaminergic pathway structure. In general, larval zebrafish appear to be good predictors of dopaminergic dysfunction, and may serve as an efficient model system in identifying environmental agents that may contribute to the onset of dopamine-related movement disorders.}","","Phenotype",NA,NA

While several of these chemicals were shown to adversely affect nervous system development, the estimated number of potential neurotoxicants is likely to be much higher. Such developmental perturbations cost society billions of dollars and result in IQ loss in children and several other neurological disorders. As there is currently no cure for such disorders, prevention is essential. Yet, the mechanisms leading to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) are poorly understood, making prevention difficult. Consequently, methods and strategies are required that allow for a fast and reliable screening of potentially neurotoxic or -active substances. With regards to this the zebrafish ($Danio$ $rerio$) embryo has emerged as a model organism. The embryos provide multiple advantageous features, promoting its use in DNT investigations as a non-mammal in vivo test system.In the work at hand, it was hypothesised that zebrafish embryos can be used to generate comprehensive insights into the mechanisms underlying DNT. To reveal these mechanisms, this thesis defined several objectives. First, to assess the applicability of zebrafish embryo behaviour for DNT screens. Therefore, six different insecticides and four endocrine disruptors (EDs) were used. Subsequently, observed behavioural deficits were to be investigated on multiple molecular levels to clarify underlying mechanisms, thus presenting the second goal. Thirdly the applicability of the embryos to lipidome investigations and their relevance for DNT-testing was to be assessed.To accomplish the first goal, it was aimed to increase the information output of one of the most commonly used behaviour assays, the light/ dark transition (LDT) test.

Especially small fragments of plastic debris measuring 1 <= 1000 {\textmu}m in size - so-called microplastics (MPs) - can pose a risk to biota by physical or chemical hazards due to ingestion, sorption and transfer of anthropogenic environmental pollutants (e.g., pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals). In recent years, there has been extensive research on the impact of streams and rivers as main entry routes for MPs into the marine environment. However, the evidence of adverse effects caused by the intake of MPs and the transfer of contaminants sorbed to MPs into freshwater ecosystems is still not conclusively documented. Therefore, this thesis addressed the impact of microplastic particles in limnic ecosystems by investigating the biological fate and effects of MPs and associated anthropogenic pollutants on different life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). To this end, effects of two common environmental pollutants (benzo(k)fluoranthene, chlorpyrifos) and two synthetic polymers (polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate) were investigated with regard to alterations of complementary biomarkers during acute and chronic exposure, as well as the trophic transfer of MPs and MP-sorbed contaminants from invertebrate organisms to zebrafish and acute toxic effects of MPs pre-exposed in a natural aquatic ecosystem. Overall, the sorption of both anthropogenic pollutants to MPs could be confirmed under various exposure scenarios. In contrast to recent study results, no adverse effects were observed when zebrafish were exposed to clean, pristine polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate. The ingestion of MPs was documented in the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish and did not induce any physiological impairment. The uptake of both pollutants was verified for all investigated species by GC-MS and fluorescence measurements. In the acute exposure scenario using the fish embryo toxicity test (FET), zebrafish embryos displayed sublethal effects and morphological deformities related to the underlying mode of action of benzo(k)fluoranthene and chlorpyrifos. Exposure to MP-associated contaminants significantly reduced malformations and attenuated biomarker responses of acetylcholine esterase activity and CYP450 induction and hence indicated a reduced bioavailability of both pollutants for zebrafish embryos. Chronic exposure of adult zebrafish to both types of MPs and pollutants was designed to assess the potential impact of long-term exposure and possible bioaccumulation of these contaminants of emerging concern. However, exposure to MP-sorbed pollutants failed to alter biomarker responses over the prolonged experimental period. In addition, a novel approach was applied to monitor the uptake of benzo(k)fluoranthene in the intestinal epithelium using confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, no significant bioaccumulation or biotransformation of benzo(k)fluoranthene and chlorpyrifos in brain and liver tissue could be demonstrated using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection and with a high-resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-FLD/HRMS). In order to address the possible vector effects of MPs, the transfer of benzo(k)fluoranthene and polymethyl methacrylate particles in a simplified limnic food web were investigated, consisting of zooplankton (Daphnia magna), sediment-dwelling invertebrates (Chironomus riparius larvae) and zebrafish as highlevel predator. However, the trophic transfer of benzo(k)fluoranthene via MPs could not be confirmed by a combination of highly sensitive fluorescence tracking using CLSM, hepatic CYP450 induction, and advanced chemical-analytical methods. To account for the demand for environmentally relevant exposure scenarios and to improve risk assessment of MPs, a mixture of the most commonly used synthetic polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride) was exposed in a well-monitored surface water body. To evaluate the potential transfer of hazardous pollutants under natural conditions, the toxicity of the MP mixture was assessed in terms of acute toxic effects (FET), potential neurotoxic effects (AChE activity, larval visual motor response test) and effects of dioxin-like substances (EROD assay) using zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, the exposed MP mixture did not elicit significantly different effects than the natural particles from sediment and suspended matter samples. Eventually, it could only be confirmed that MPs could act as carriers for environmental contaminants following ingestion by various organisms. However, increased deleterious effects of MP-sorbed contaminants on various sensitive life stages of zebrafish could not be corroborated by acute or prolonged exposure, trophic transfer, or natural exposure. The findings suggest that the sorption of pollutants to MPs is more likely to reduce the bioavailability as a result of slow desorption within the organism. Although, MPs offer an alternative exposure route for aquatic organisms via ingestion. Even chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations did not induce bioaccumulation of both highly lipophilic substances in zebrafish tissues. Lastly, the sorption behavior of MPs under realistic environmental exposure conditions was more likely to approximate the behavior of natural particles. Consequently, MPs might pose only a limited risk to limnic communities, especially with regard to the comparatively small fraction of plastic particles in freshwater ecosystems compared to the multitude of naturally occurring (a)biotic particles.}","","",NA,NA

Effects ranged from subtle changes in the physiology and sexual behaviour of fish to permanently altered sexual differentiation and growth, and reproductive impairment. Most attention has been directed towards identifying the main estrogenic chemicals, because many of the effects reported in wildlife appear to be a consequence of {\textquoteleft}feminization{\textquoteright} of males. Environmental estrogens can be anthropogenic, such as certain pharmaceuticals, pesticides and industrial chemicals or natural, such as phyto- and mycoestrogens. Resorcyclic acid lactones (RALs) are the only known class of estrogenic mycotoxins and show estrogenic activity in the range of natural steroid estrogens. RALs occur as secondary metabolites of Fusarium spec. fungi growing on a variety of cereals. Zearalenone (ZON) belongs to the chemical group of RALs and is one of the worldwide most common mycotoxins. The occurrence of mycotoxins has been studied extensively in food, feed products, and domestic animals. Agricultural products around the world exhibited ZON contaminations of up to 69 \% of the tested samples. However, only little is known about the ecotoxicological effects of ZON at concentrations found in the environment. In this research project, the ecotoxicological potential of ZON was evaluated. Effects on fish caused by an exposure to ZON were assessed using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism. An embryo toxicity test was performed to investigate toxic effects of ZON on fish development. This study was complemented with a 30 day zebrafish early life-stage experiment to assess the influence of ZON on juvenile growth. In a second step the estrogenic potency of ZON and its effects on adult fish were examined. A recombinant yeast estrogen screen (rYES) was used as an in vitro assay to determine effects on the activation of estrogen receptor-regulated genes. Zebrafish were exposed to ZON in a 42 day reproduction experiment enabling assessment of reproductive as well as physiological and morphological parameters. In a third step, the estrogenic potency of ZON was studied in a life-cycle experiment. This study was designed to investigate possible effects of continuous long-term exposure including a subsequent depuration period as well as possible transgenerational effects of F0 exposure on F1 generation. The offspring of the F0 generation that was exposed to ZON for 21 days was raised in a 140 day exposure experiment from embryo to adult. In a subsequent 42 day reproduction experiment, spawning groups of the F1 generation were either exposed to ZON (after growing up in clean water) or clean water (after growing up under ZON exposure) and effects on developmental, reproductive as well as physiological parameters were assessed. Exposure to ZON had no effects on embryonic development up to 2000 ng/L, but a positive correlation between the body length and ZON concentration of up to 100 ng/L suggests a growth promoting effect for zebrafish exposed during 30 days. Although ZON revealed a moderate estrogenic potency in vitro (rYES), it exhibited a comparably strong effect on induction of VTG (1000 ng/L) and reproduction (100 ng/L) in vivo during 21 days exposure. It was further demonstrated that ZON influenced growth (1000 ng/L), sexual differentiation (320 ng/L), reproduction (1000 ng/L), and VTG levels (1000 ng/L) in zebrafish exposed from fertilization to day 140. Furthermore, ZON revealed a possible transgenerational effect on growth caused by short-term exposure of F0 and F1 generation each for 21 days to 1000 ng/L. In the framework of this project, relevant data of the ecotoxicological relevance of ZON were collected. The estrogenic potential of ZON was confirmed in vitro and in vivo and detrimental effects on zebrafish reproduction were demonstrated. This indicates that ZON may have an effect on fish populations in the aquatic environment. Effects were observed at concentrations near the maximum measured values in surface waters (approximately double) and below the maximum values measured in effluents (approximately half). Even though to date there is not much data published presenting ZON concentrations in the aquatic environment and effects on different (native) fish species, this project demonstrated that ZON has the potential to pose a threat to fish in the aquatic environment. In a second research project, the embryo toxicity and genotoxicity of biofilm and sediment from the catchment area of a STP was investigated. An embryo toxicity test with zebrafish and the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) with primary cells isolated from the embryos were applied to investigate native biofilm for the first time. Biofilms were sampled from different sections of the sewage system and sediments were taken from the rive Wyna directly at, upstream and downstream of the STP discharge Mittleres Wynental (Switzerland). The aim of this study was to verify the applicability of the aforementioned test system to investigate native biofilm and to evaluate the toxicity of the different sampling sites. Clear differences in the embryo toxicity and genotoxicity of the biofilm from different sewage system sections as well as from the sediment sampling sites were found. Significant genotoxicity was determined in all biofilm and sediment samples. Temporal variability in toxicity were observed in some of the biofilm and sediment samples. Based on the results of this study it can be suggested that biofilm implemented in ecotoxicological bioassays such as the embryo toxicity test and comet assay with zebrafish can be a useful tool to assess (waste) water quality.}","","Estrogens",NA,NA

In the last decades, an increasing number of studies demonstrated that numerous pollutants, among them metals and pesticides, are able to impair olfaction in environmentally relevant concentrations, thereby disrupting pivotal behaviors. However, the toxic mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction largely remain unknown and despite the paramount significance of olfaction for fish, olfactory endpoints have not yet been incorporated into the environmental risk assessment of chemicals. The objective of the present Ph.D. thesis was to investigate the impact of three commonly used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, linuron, and permethrin) and cadmium (Cd) on the olfactory system of zebrafish (Danio rerio).

Familial forms of PD account for 5-10\% of all PD cases suggesting that other factors such as the environment have a role in the development of sporadic cases of PD. Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for PD. Ziram, a dithiocarbamate fungicide commonly used in California, increases the risk of PD for individuals living and working in areas where the pesticide is sprayed. Ziram has previously been found in vitro to cause selective dopaminergic cell toxicity, inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) levels in primary neuronal cultures. In this dissertation we utilize zebrafish embryos (ZF, Danio rerio) to study ziram in an in vivo system and to determine if ziram{\textquoteright}s toxicity is mediated via synuclein.We found that ziram is toxic to ZF at nanomolar concentrations and caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior in ZF. Since ziram increases α-syn concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF γ-synuclein 1 (γ1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms and ZF γ1 appears to be a functional homologue of α-syn. We found that recombinant ZF γ1 formed fibrils in vitro and overexpression of ZF γ1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity similarly to α-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF γ1 with morpholinos or disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 protected against ziram{\textquoteright}s DA toxicity.Over the course of this dissertation we have demonstrated that ziram is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo and that its toxicity is synuclein-dependent.

Due to low throughput and high cost, the traditional toxicity testing strategy, using rodent and higher mammalian animal-based models, is unable to adequately meet these competing demands. Hence, there is increasing recognition of the value of transforming toxicity testing to reduce the usage of mammal models and to more efficiently and reliably predict human relevant toxicity. To this end, a battery approach, integrating diverse in vitro and alternative animal models, was initiated to complement and accelerate hazard assessment. These alternative models are amenable to inexpensive, rapid and robust screening. In this dissertation, I introduce the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a novel alternative animal model to study developmental neurotoxicity. I developed and expanded a fully automated planarian high-throughput (HTS) screening platform to accomplish rapid screening of multiple morphological and behavioral endpoints. This HTS platform was evaluated for robustness, strengths and weaknesses, using an 87-compound library with known and suspected compounds and a 15-compound flame retardant library. As a unique advantage, the similar size of adult and regenerating planarians allows for direct comparison of two worm types to discern development-specific toxicity from overt systemic toxicity. We show that planarian is a useful model to potentially link toxicity pathways to whole-animal adverse functional outcomes by providing a large repertoire of behavioral endpoints. Comparative analysis of the planarian model with other alternative models, including zebrafish, nematode and in vitro cell-based models, provides insight into how different models complement each other in the battery approach. Finally, I discuss our comparative screen of organophosphrous pesticides (OPs) using the expanded platform, to investigate the possible mechanisms of developmental toxicity in OPs. Altogether, by establishing a new alternative animal model this work adds value to the battery approach to accelerate toxicity screening and prioritize toxicants, and provide further insight into the potential mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity.}","","{planarian};Animal Shells;Animals",NA,NA

O tebuconazol foi capaz de aumentar a dist{\^a}ncia ocular de larvas aos 5 dpf e reduzir a capacidade explorat{\'o}ria desses animais, e ainda diminuir a atividade locomotora de peixe-zebra adultos expostos por 96 horas. Al{\'e}m disso, este fungicida diminuiu a atividade da AChE tanto em larvas de 5 dpf, quanto em enc{\'e}falo de animais adultos. Al{\'e}m do mais, o tebuconacol aumentou a express{\~a}o relativa de mRNA da AChE em larvas, no entanto, n{\~a}o alterou em adultos.A exposi{\c c}{\~a}o ao dicl{\'o}rvos, nas fases iniciais do desenvolvimento (1 hpf - 7 dpf), reduziu o tamanho corporal, a taxa de batimentos card{\'\i}acos e a superf{\'\i}cie dos olhos de larvas de 7 dpf, bem como afetou a capacidade de escape de larvas aos 7 e 14 dpf. Al{\'e}m disso, reduziu a capacidade explorat{\'o}ria aos 7 e 14 dpf, padr{\~a}o mantido quando os animais tornaram-se adultos jovens aos 30 dpf, e adultos aos 70 dpf.

Manganese (Mn) is a metal found in the environment, which when in excess, accumulates in the CNS making it a potential hazard to health. In addition to Mn, other neurotoxic agents can cause changes, leading to deficits in neurotransmission systems. The growth of crop pests has exponentially increased the use of agrochemicals to maintain plantations. The fungicide tebuconazole is a triazole used in crops, such as barley, wheat, peanuts and orchard fruits and related to behavioral and oxidative changes. The insecticide dichlorvos, belongs to organophosphate family, acts through the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) inhibition, leading to hyperstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic system is characterized by the action of acetylcholine(ACh) on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The level of this molecule is regulated by acetylcholinesterase(AChE), which catalyzes degradation of ACh into choline and acetate. Purinergic system is characterized by the action of ATP and adenosine on purinoreceptor P2 and P1, respectively. The levels of these molecules are regulated by ectonucleotidases, which constitute the extracellular cascade for ATP hydrolysis to adenosine. Adenosine can be subsequently deaminated to inosine by action of adenosine deaminase (ADA). Dopamine(DA), synthesized from L-DOPA, is the neurotransmitter of the dopaminergic system and it acts through its D1-D5 receptors, controlling the start and execution of movement. This study aims to evaluate the effects of exposure to manganese and pesticides, such as dichlorvos and tebuconazole, on behavioral parameters in larval and adult zebrafish, as well as its effects on purinergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling. Exposure to MnCl2 in the early stages of development (1 hpf - 5 dpf) was able to reduce the distance traveled, absolute turn angle and mobile time of the larvae at 5, 7 and 10 dpf.In addition, it caused an increase in TH levels at 5 and 7 dpf, followed by a reduction at 10 dpf. There was also an increase in markers of cell death. In adult animals, exposure during 96 hours caused a reduction in distance traveled, number of line crossings and absolute turn angle, and an inhibition on memory acquisition through the inhibitory avoidance task. In addition, adult animals exposed to MnCl2 showed increased levels of markers of cell death, TH and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) in the brain. The 96-hour exposure to this metal was also able to inhibit the NTPDases and ecto-ADA activities and to reduce ADA2.1-mRNA transcripts, besides for increasing ADP levels and reducing the amount of AMP, ADO and INO in the incubation medium. Tebuconazole was able to increase the ocular distance of larvae at 5 dpf and reduce the exploratory behavior of these animals, and still decrease the locomotor activity of 96 hours exposed adult zebrafish. Moreover, this fungicide decreased AChE activity in both 5 dpf larvae and brains of adult animals. Exposure to dichlorvos (1 hpf - 7 dpf) reduced body length, heartbeat rate and larval surface at 7 dpf as well as affected the escape capacity of larvae at 7 and 14 dpf. Further, it reduced exploratory behavior at 7 and 14 dpf, maintaining this pattern when animals became young adults at 30 dpf, and adults at 70 dpf. However, the analysis performed at 120 dpf showed a recovery of behavioral activity equal to the control. In addition, the analysis of exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development at 120 dpf on the enzymes of the purinergic system, showed that this insecticide is able to elevate the ecto-5{\textquoteright}-nucleotidase activity and reduce the ecto-ADA activity.The results showed that neurotoxic agents, such as Mn, dichlorvos and tebuconazole, play a role in the larval and adult behavior of zebrafish, and affect different neurotransmission systems. Such behavioral changes may be associated with the deficits observed in neurochemical and molecular mechanisms investigated.}","","{BIOLOGIA CELULAR};Purines",NA,NA

We have pioneered the asexual freshwater planarian, Dugesia japonica, as an alternative model for developmental neurotoxicology. Planarians have strong regenerative capabilities, wherein after decapitation, the resulting tail piece will regenerate a new head, including a brain, within 2 weeks. Moreover, planarians possess several quantifiable behaviors coordinated by distinct neuronal subpopulations, enabling testing of both adult and developing/regenerating animals with the same assays to directly compare effects on neuronal function. We have established and begun validating the planarian toxicology platform through screens testing 10-87 compounds. We demonstrate that planarians have similar sensitivity to existing alternative animal models, such as developing zebrafish. Planarians are particularly sensitive to pesticides and are good predictors of known developmentally neurotoxic pesticides, such as organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), one of the most used class of pesticides in the world. OPs are acutely toxic due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent cholinergic overstimulation. However, growing evidence suggests that chronic, low dose exposure to OPs, particularly during development, may cause toxicity independent of effects on AChE. Alternative mechanisms of OP developmental neurotoxicity have been proposed, but direct connections between molecular/cellular defects with their functional significance have been limited using traditional models. Our planarian screening platform, on the other hand, is uniquely suited to provide the necessary link between mechanism and functional effects. First, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo properties of planarian cholinesterase and its structural and functional interactions with OPs to contextualize known OP mechanisms. Second, through a comparative screen of 6 OPs and chemicals targeting suggested alternative OP targets, including the endocannabinoid system, cytoskeleton and oxidative stress, we correlate the distinct toxicological profiles of different OPs with specific toxic pathways. Together, these studies demonstrate the utility of the planarian system to the modern toxicology pipeline, through its ability to directly connect mechanisms with their functional significance.}","","{planarians};Animals;Pesticides;Animal Shells",NA,NA

Using zebrafish, we compared the effectiveness of three different OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF), diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) on survival, AChE inhibition and larval motility. We conclude that at equimolar concentrations CPF is the most effective OP of the three tested. 300nM CPF inhibited AChE when measured at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) by 80\%, which correlated to a 35\% decrease in larval motility when measured at 6 dpf. We isolated the cDNA of zfkcc2 , which encodes for an important cation-chloride cotransporter responsible for establishing a chloride gradient that allows for the neurotransmitter GABA to become inhibitory for a subset of neurons. By isolating the cDNA of zfkcc2 , we were able to characterize its expression pattern up to 4 dpf. Using qRT-PCR, we showed that the expression of zfkcc2 rises from 2 to 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). The expression of zfkcc2 is found at 1 dpf in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain in a distinct pattern. By 3 dpf, zfkcc2 expression is found throughout most of the developing zebrafish brain. We were then able to characterize the expression pattern of zfnkcc1, which encodes for a cation-chloride cotransporter that works opposite to zfkcc2 and establishes a chloride gradient allowing GABA to be excitatory during development. Expression of zfnkcc1 is found at 1 dpf throughout most of the developing zebrafish head including in some non-neural tissue, but appears concentrated to the otic vesicle at 3 dpf. Using double in situ hybridization, we investigated the nature of the developmental switch from zfnkcc1 to zfkcc2 by looking at regions where there was an interaction between both genes{\textquoteright} expression patterns in the developing zebrafish nervous system. We preliminarily examined how affecting nicotinic signaling with exposures to nicotinic agonists/antagonists can affect the expression of zfnkcc2 and zfkcc2 . While there were no apparent changes in the expression pattern from any of the exposures at 2 dpf, we found that by 3 dpf nicotine and CPF exposures resulted in an incomplete expression pattern for zfkcc2 that seemed to be delayed. However, the expression of zfnkcc1 at the otic vesicle was unaffected by exposure. Our results suggest that disrupting nicotinic signaling during development can affect the expression of an important cation-chloride cotransporter, zfkcc2 , that plays a major role in establishing the necessary chloride gradient for the proper functioning of GABA during development. Future studies should focus on investigating the nature of the developmental switch between zfnkcc1 and zfkcc2 to see if the possibility of their regulation being coupled is a target for exposures.}","","{zebrafish};Pesticides",NA,NA

Therefore, the purpose of this experiment is to determine how the UV-B radiation affects the earthworm movement behaviors. Some Fos-labelled cells in earthworm ventral nerve cord were shown after the UV-B radiation. This suggested that some neurons were activated by UV-B radiation. The UV-B radiated nerves were found to have higher protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activity, an effect not mediated by direct UV-B absorption. PKC might regulate the calcium channel(s) to increase the intracellular calcium concentration to alter acetylcholine (ACh) release and choline acetyltransferase to affect ACh synthesis in presynaptic cells. The treatment of PKC activator, PMA and calcium ionophore, A23187 both enhanced the abnormal behavior caused by UV-B radiation. And calcium channels blocker, verapamil blocked the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation. On the other hand, the UV-B radiation also affected the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in the synaptic cleft for ACh hydrolysis. Again, AChE activity was not affected by direct UV-B absorption. And AChE inhibitor, chlorpyrifos, treatment enhanced the earthworm behavior. Together, all of those results support that PKCα and AChE are involved in the regulation of earthworm movement caused by UV-B radiation. ; Introduction - 1 - Earthworms come out the soil - 1 - Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone depletion on the earth - 2 - UV damage - 2 - Neuron-muscle regulation - 4 - Materials and Methods{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}-7- Animals - 7 - Chemicals - 7 - UV exposure - 7 - Behaviors of earthworm - 7 - Fos immunohistochemistry - 8 - Protein kinase C activity - 9 - Acetylcholinesterase assay - 11 - H2O2 treatment on isolated body wall - 11 - Statistical analysis - 12 - Results - 13 - The movement behavior of earthworms - 13 - Fos immunohistochemistry - 13 - The earthworm nerve PKCα activity after UV-B exposure - 14 - PMA enhanced the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 14 - A23187 treatment enhanced the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 15 - The influence of verapamil treatment on the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 15 - The AChE activity after UV-B exposure - 16 - Chlorpyrifos treatment enhanced the S-shape movement and the jumping behavior caused by UV-B radiation - 16 - The influence of H2O2 on earthworm AChE activity - 17 - Discussion - 18 - Reference - 22 - Figures{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis}{\textellipsis} {\textellipsis}-29-}","","{UV}",NA,NA

The increasing chemical load has raised concerns in regard to the protection of aquatic ecosystem health. This dissertation focuses on two different approaches to evaluate aquatic toxicity due to chemicals. The first approach focuses on adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to understand the interactions between contaminants and molecular initiating events and the translation of molecular level insults to apical level endpoints such as behavior and growth which are relevant to an ecological risk assessor. The impacts of two chemical classes (azole and strobilurin) of fungicides on aquatic vertebrate (zebrafish, Danio rerio) were studied using the AOP approach. Several molecular, cellular, and apical endpoints were assessed in embryo-larval zebrafish exposed to azole and strobilurin fungicides. The azole fungicides were shown to induce lipid peroxidation and apoptosis whereas strobilurin fungicides decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics, induced oxidative stress, and was associated with decreased swimming behavior and growth. These kinds of studies are vital to understand the impact of individual or classes of contaminants on aquatic organisms and they also generate data to help a risk assessor make informed decisions to protect aquatic health. Although prior knowledge of exposure is beneficial, in the natural environment, aquatic organisms may be exposed to complex chemical mixtures with an unknown composition and toxicity. The recent advances in analytical instrumentation (e.g. high-resolution mass spectrometry) could help us to understand the composition of complex chemical mixtures using a non-targeted analysis workflow. This dissertation explored a new approach to understand and predict impacts of complex mixtures on aquatic health. This approach integrates information from the non-targeted analysis into a quantitative structural activity relationship model to predict molecular level toxicity signatures, called NTA-QSAR workflow. The applicability of NTA-QSAR workflow was validated by toxicity testing of an effluent dominated stream (Lubbock Canyon Lake System) using early life stages of zebrafish. The NTA-QSAR workflow predicted that water samples from the Lubbock Canyon Lake System may act on receptors from the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway, the serotonin receptor signaling pathway, and the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in aquatic vertebrates. The impact on the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway and the serotonin receptor signaling pathway were confirmed by exposing early life stages of zebrafish to ambient water samples. This research will aid in chemical fingerprint guided effect analysis of complex chemical mixtures which could ultimately help risk assessors in the protection of environmental and human health.}","","{Zebrafish}",NA,NA

TM has been detected in surface waters at levels above aquatic life benchmarks and has raised concerns about its potential toxicity to fish. To address these concerns, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TM were determined in two fish species. Acute and chronic exposures to 0.02-163 μg TM/L were conducted in embryonic- and larval-stage fathead minnows and in embryonic-stage zebrafish. Endpoints to assess health and neurotoxicity were monitored throughout the duration of the exposure, including survival, hatching, foraging efficiency, embryonic motor activity, and predator escape behavior. TM-exposed fathead minnows experienced reductions in survival, changes to embryonic motor activity, and altered predator escape behavior while TM-exposed zebrafish embryos experienced reduced hatching rates and changes to the predator escape behavior. Lastly, molecular modeling was used to gain preliminary insight on the interactions of TM with the nAChR between organisms. While TM does not target fish, they still experience effects as a result of TM exposure. Taken together, this research indicates that further investigation of the effects of TM on fish is necessary to determine the impacts of this prevalent pesticide on the health of aquatic ecosystems.}","","{Toxicity};Pesticides",NA,NA

ALS affects approximately 1 in 400 people worldwide, and most ALS cases are sporadic (sALS) with no known causative factors. Previous work has indicated that the organochlorine pesticide cis-chlordane is found more often in the blood of sALS patients than controls (Su et al., 2016), however little is known about how environmental risk factors induce motor neuron death. Here we show that cis-chlordane is especially toxic to motor neurons in vitro and induces motor neuron degeneration and NMJ deficits in vivo using zebrafish. We find that stem-cell derived motor neurons are more sensitive to cis-chlordane than other cell types and show that cis-chlordane treatment toxicity is independent of its known antagonism at the GABAA receptor. Our transcriptomic analysis of motor neurons indicates that cis-chlordane treatment disrupts similar mechanisms to those previously observed in ALS, inducing ER and mitochondrial stress and perturbing ion homeostasis. Investigation of these perturbations in vitro indicates that autophagic activity and ROS levels increase with cis-chlordane treatment.

Organophosphate FRs (OPFRs), and in particular tris (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), have been increasingly detected in textiles and foam padding used in a variety of consumer products including camping equipment, upholstered furniture, and baby products. Like PBDEs, OPFRs are additive, meaning that they are not chemically bound to the treated material and can more readily leach out into the surrounding environment. Indeed, OPFRs have been detected in numerous environmental and biological matrices, often at concentrations similar to or exceeding that of PBDEs. Although OPFRs have been in use for several decades, relatively little is known regarding their potential for adverse human and environmental health consequences. However, based on their structural similarity to OP pesticides, they may have analogous mechanisms of toxicity. OP pesticide toxicity is classically associated with cholinesterase inhibition, resulting in cholinergic intoxication syndrome. OPFRs have been shown to be ineffective cholinesterase inhibitors, however chlorpyrifos (CPF) and other OP pesticides have been shown to elicit adverse effects on developing organisms through other mechanisms. The main objective of this research project was to evaluate the toxicity of four structurally similar OPFRs (TDCPP; tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, (TDBPP); tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) in comparison to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a well-studied OP pesticide. A combination of in vitro and in vivo models was used to elucidate potential mechanisms as well as functional consequences of exposure in developing organisms. In the first research aim, a series of in vitro experiments with neurotypic PC12 cells was used to evaluate the effects of four structurally similar OPFRs (TDCPP, TDBPP, TCEP, or TCPP) and CPF on neurodevelopment. The effects of TDCPP were also compared to that of BDE-47, a major component of the commercial PentaBDE mixture. In general, TDCPP elicited similar or greater effects when compared to an equimolar concentration of CPF. All OPFRs tested produced similar decrements in cell number and altered phenotypic differentiation, while BDE-47 had no effect on cell number, cell growth, or neurite growth. For the second research aim, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to evaluate the effects of the same suite of chemicals on early development. TDCPP, TDBPP, and CPF elicited overt toxicity (e.g., malformations or death) within the concentration range tested (0.033-100 {\textmu}M). TDBPP was the most potent with 100\% mortality by 6 days post fertilization (dpf) at >=3.3 {\textmu}M. CPF and TDCPP showed equivalent toxicity with malformations observed in at 10 {\textmu}M and significant mortality (>=75\%) at >=33 {\textmu}M. There was no overt toxicity among TCEP- and TCPP-exposed fish. All test chemicals affected larval swimming behavior on 6 dpf at concentrations below the overt toxicity threshold. Parent chemical was detected in all in embryonic (1 dpf) and larval (5 dpf) tissues. TDCPP and TDBPP showed rapid and extensive metabolism. Finally, for the third aim, juvenile (45-55 dpf) zebrafish were exposed to CPF (1 {\textmu}g/g food) or TDCPP (Low TDCPP = 1 {\textmu}g/g food; High TDCPP = 40 {\textmu}g/g food) via diet for 28 days followed by a 7 day depuration period where all treatments received clean food. A dietary exposure was chosen to more closely recapitulate exposure in humans. Samples were collected at seven time points throughout the experiment: days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 30, 35. Whole tissues were collected for tissue accumulation and histopathology endpoints. Viscera and brain were dissected and flash frozen separately for DNA damage analyses. Tissue measurements of CPF, TDCPP, and the metabolite bis (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (BDCPP) were often below the method detection limit, however when present there was a trend towards increased accumulation with treatment and time. On Day 7 Low TDCPP caused a dramatic but transient increase in DNA damage in both viscera and brain that returned to control levels by Day 14. Similar results have been seen previously with other genotoxicants and may be due to CPF and High TDCPP inducing an adaptive response prior to the 7 day sampling point. All treatments shifted the neurohypophysis to adenohypophysis ratio (NH/AH; Day 7 only) and significantly increased thyroid follicle activation (Day 14). Finally High TDCPP affected gonad maturation, causing a significant increase in ovary follicle development (Day 14) and a transient but marked decrease in testes maturity (Day 7). Taken together these data suggest that dietary exposure to TDCPP and CPF elicits DNA damage in brain and viscera and alters endocrine function in juvenile zebrafish. Importantly, analyses were restricted to the first three time points (Days 0, 7, and 14) due to the emergence a disease among the experimental colony. Although these samples were collected prior to the disease becoming apparent, it remains a potential confounder of the current results.}","","{Toxicity};Organophosphates;Halogens",NA,NA

The influence of oxygen depletion on the toxicity of substances was included as an additional interacting factor. To analyse complex interactions, the predator-prey behaviour between zebrafish and chironomid larvae (Chironomus riparius) was investigated. Another aspect of this work were studies on complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as the water accommodated fraction of crude oil, and their effects on the behaviour of marine amphipods (Corophium volutator), as well as semi-field experiments with freshwater amphipods (Gammarus pulex). My investigations showed that effects of various substances in environmentally relevant concentration ranges are exerted on different levels of biological organisation, both in amphipods and fish. It could be shown that abiotic parameters modify the effects of pollutants. When investigating mixtures of substances with similar or different modes of action, additivity occurred in the majority of cases which usually were consistent for all investigated parameters (enzyme activity, locomotor activity, developmental impairment, mortality). Effects of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos on the interactions between fish and chironomids could be detected in environmentally relevant concentration ranges. The effects of the water accommodated fraction of crude oil which represents a great risk for aquatic organisms in costal habitats were displayed by alterations in the behaviour of the marine amphipod Corophium volutator. For a continuous monitoring of water quality in monitoring stations, the resident amphipod Gammarus pulex proved to be a suitable and relevant test organism, as it responds sensitive to complex mixtures of pollutants in surface waters. In summary, behavioural parameters proved to be integrative, relevant and sensitive parameters for the different research topics/questions in the present work, and can also be recommended to be used to analyse interspecific interactions. To judge on the effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms in the environment, abiotic parameters as well as mixtures of pollutants should be included. Additionally, biochemical measurements as well as behavioural tests are important, to adequately assess the toxicity of pollutants. Therefore, for an integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms, a battery of different methods as well as more realistic exposure scenarios should be taken into account.}","","{MixTox model};Biochemistry",NA,NA
