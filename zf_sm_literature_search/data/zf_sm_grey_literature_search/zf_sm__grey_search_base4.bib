note = {{Complex mixtures of anthropogenic chemicals including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals, are entering the aquatic environment via surface runoff, leaching, and effluent discharge. The increasing chemical load has raised concerns in regard to the protection of aquatic ecosystem health. This dissertation focuses on two different approaches to evaluate aquatic toxicity due to chemicals. The first approach focuses on adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to understand the interactions between contaminants and molecular initiating events and the translation of molecular level insults to apical level endpoints such as behavior and growth which are relevant to an ecological risk assessor. The impacts of two chemical classes (azole and strobilurin) of fungicides on aquatic vertebrate (zebrafish, Danio rerio) were studied using the AOP approach. Several molecular, cellular, and apical endpoints were assessed in embryo-larval zebrafish exposed to azole and strobilurin fungicides. The azole fungicides were shown to induce lipid peroxidation and apoptosis whereas strobilurin fungicides decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics, induced oxidative stress, and was associated with decreased swimming behavior and growth. These kinds of studies are vital to understand the impact of individual or classes of contaminants on aquatic organisms and they also generate data to help a risk assessor make informed decisions to protect aquatic health. Although prior knowledge of exposure is beneficial, in the natural environment, aquatic organisms may be exposed to complex chemical mixtures with an unknown composition and toxicity. The recent advances in analytical instrumentation (e.g. high-resolution mass spectrometry) could help us to understand the composition of complex chemical mixtures using a non-targeted analysis workflow. This dissertation explored a new approach to understand and predict impacts of complex mixtures on aquatic health. This approach integrates information from the non-targeted analysis into a quantitative structural activity relationship model to predict molecular level toxicity signatures, called NTA-QSAR workflow. The applicability of NTA-QSAR workflow was validated by toxicity testing of an effluent dominated stream (Lubbock Canyon Lake System) using early life stages of zebrafish. The NTA-QSAR workflow predicted that water samples from the Lubbock Canyon Lake System may act on receptors from the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway, the serotonin receptor signaling pathway, and the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in aquatic vertebrates. The impact on the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway and the serotonin receptor signaling pathway were confirmed by exposing early life stages of zebrafish to ambient water samples. This research will aid in chemical fingerprint guided effect analysis of complex chemical mixtures which could ultimately help risk assessors in the protection of environmental and human health.}},

note = {{Thiamethoxam (TM) is a commonly used neonicotinoid pesticide that acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. TM has been detected in surface waters at levels above aquatic life benchmarks and has raised concerns about its potential toxicity to fish. To address these concerns, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TM were determined in two fish species. Acute and chronic exposures to 0.02-163 μg TM/L were conducted in embryonic- and larval-stage fathead minnows and in embryonic-stage zebrafish. Endpoints to assess health and neurotoxicity were monitored throughout the duration of the exposure, including survival, hatching, foraging efficiency, embryonic motor activity, and predator escape behavior. TM-exposed fathead minnows experienced reductions in survival, changes to embryonic motor activity, and altered predator escape behavior while TM-exposed zebrafish embryos experienced reduced hatching rates and changes to the predator escape behavior. Lastly, molecular modeling was used to gain preliminary insight on the interactions of TM with the nAChR between organisms. While TM does not target fish, they still experience effects as a result of TM exposure. Taken together, this research indicates that further investigation of the effects of TM on fish is necessary to determine the impacts of this prevalent pesticide on the health of aquatic ecosystems.}},

note = {{Universit{\'e} d{\textquoteright}Ottawa / University of Ottawa ; Rotenone is a commercially available pesticide with a variety of industrial applications. However, occupational exposure to rotenone has been implicated in the development of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. To explore the mechanism of dopamine neuron death secondary to rotenone exposure, the zebrafish was used as a live animal screening tool for environmentally-induced Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. After testing a variety of small molecule compounds on embryonic zebrafish for their potential to cause dopamine neuron loss, we identified that rotenone exposure induces a bradykinetic dopamine neuron loss phenotype. This phenotype was characterized by decreased locomotion, sensory insensitivity, and a transient but marked decrease in the number of dopamine neurons in embryos exposed to 100nM rotenone, with a concomitant decrease in dopamine transporter mRNA levels. The dopamine neuron deficits were observed in the subpallium, pretectum, olfactory bulb, but these losses were most pronounced in the ventral diencephalon after rotenone exposure. Rotenone damages the mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequently induces ROS-mediated apoptosis in these dopamine neurons. The rotenone-induced dopamine neuron loss and locomotion phenotypes could be partially rescued in zebrafish larvae with ascorbic acid co-treatment during rotenone exposure. Adults raised from zebrafish embryos exposed to rotenone did not show any deficits to their dopamine neuron distribution, but did show anxiety-like behaviors and upregulation of dopamine receptor D1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that rotenone exposure can cause dopamine neuron death through ROS- mediated apoptosis, and supports an environmental cause of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. ￼La roténone est un pesticide disponible dans le commerce et utilisé pour une variété d{\textquoteright}usages industriels.

note = {{Fish behaviors have great potential as models for the study of pharmacology, genetics, and neuroscience. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01\% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01\% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

note = {{Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, quickly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of motor neurons. ALS affects approximately 1 in 400 people worldwide, and most ALS cases are sporadic (sALS) with no known causative factors. Previous work has indicated that the organochlorine pesticide cis-chlordane is found more often in the blood of sALS patients than controls (Su et al., 2016), however little is known about how environmental risk factors induce motor neuron death. Here we show that cis-chlordane is especially toxic to motor neurons in vitro and induces motor neuron degeneration and NMJ deficits in vivo using zebrafish. We find that stem-cell derived motor neurons are more sensitive to cis-chlordane than other cell types and show that cis-chlordane treatment toxicity is independent of its known antagonism at the GABAA receptor. Our transcriptomic analysis of motor neurons indicates that cis-chlordane treatment disrupts similar mechanisms to those previously observed in ALS, inducing ER and mitochondrial stress and perturbing ion homeostasis. Investigation of these perturbations in vitro indicates that autophagic activity and ROS levels increase with cis-chlordane treatment. Our results lay the groundwork for studying how environmental pollutants contribute to sporadic ALS etiology. ; In Copyright {\textendash} Non-Commercial Use Permitted (InC-NC)}},

note = {{Following the phase out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), manufacturers turned to several alternative flame retardants (FRs) to meet flammability standards. Organophosphate FRs (OPFRs), and in particular tris (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), have been increasingly detected in textiles and foam padding used in a variety of consumer products including camping equipment, upholstered furniture, and baby products. Like PBDEs, OPFRs are additive, meaning that they are not chemically bound to the treated material and can more readily leach out into the surrounding environment. Indeed, OPFRs have been detected in numerous environmental and biological matrices, often at concentrations similar to or exceeding that of PBDEs. Although OPFRs have been in use for several decades, relatively little is known regarding their potential for adverse human and environmental health consequences. However, based on their structural similarity to OP pesticides, they may have analogous mechanisms of toxicity. OP pesticide toxicity is classically associated with cholinesterase inhibition, resulting in cholinergic intoxication syndrome. OPFRs have been shown to be ineffective cholinesterase inhibitors, however chlorpyrifos (CPF) and other OP pesticides have been shown to elicit adverse effects on developing organisms through other mechanisms. The main objective of this research project was to evaluate the toxicity of four structurally similar OPFRs (TDCPP; tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, (TDBPP); tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) in comparison to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a well-studied OP pesticide. A combination of in vitro and in vivo models was used to elucidate potential mechanisms as well as functional consequences of exposure in developing organisms. In the first research aim, a series of in vitro experiments with neurotypic PC12 cells was used to evaluate the effects of four structurally similar OPFRs (TDCPP, TDBPP, TCEP, or TCPP) and CPF on neurodevelopment. The effects of TDCPP were also compared to that of BDE-47, a major component of the commercial PentaBDE mixture. In general, TDCPP elicited similar or greater effects when compared to an equimolar concentration of CPF. All OPFRs tested produced similar decrements in cell number and altered phenotypic differentiation, while BDE-47 had no effect on cell number, cell growth, or neurite growth. For the second research aim, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to evaluate the effects of the same suite of chemicals on early development. TDCPP, TDBPP, and CPF elicited overt toxicity (e.g., malformations or death) within the concentration range tested (0.033-100 {\textmu}M). TDBPP was the most potent with 100\% mortality by 6 days post fertilization (dpf) at >=3.3 {\textmu}M. CPF and TDCPP showed equivalent toxicity with malformations observed in at 10 {\textmu}M and significant mortality (>=75\%) at >=33 {\textmu}M. There was no overt toxicity among TCEP- and TCPP-exposed fish. All test chemicals affected larval swimming behavior on 6 dpf at concentrations below the overt toxicity threshold. Parent chemical was detected in all in embryonic (1 dpf) and larval (5 dpf) tissues. TDCPP and TDBPP showed rapid and extensive metabolism. Finally, for the third aim, juvenile (45-55 dpf) zebrafish were exposed to CPF (1 {\textmu}g/g food) or TDCPP (Low TDCPP = 1 {\textmu}g/g food; High TDCPP = 40 {\textmu}g/g food) via diet for 28 days followed by a 7 day depuration period where all treatments received clean food. A dietary exposure was chosen to more closely recapitulate exposure in humans. Samples were collected at seven time points throughout the experiment: days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 30, 35. Whole tissues were collected for tissue accumulation and histopathology endpoints. Viscera and brain were dissected and flash frozen separately for DNA damage analyses. Tissue measurements of CPF, TDCPP, and the metabolite bis (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (BDCPP) were often below the method detection limit, however when present there was a trend towards increased accumulation with treatment and time. On Day 7 Low TDCPP caused a dramatic but transient increase in DNA damage in both viscera and brain that returned to control levels by Day 14. Similar results have been seen previously with other genotoxicants and may be due to CPF and High TDCPP inducing an adaptive response prior to the 7 day sampling point. All treatments shifted the neurohypophysis to adenohypophysis ratio (NH/AH; Day 7 only) and significantly increased thyroid follicle activation (Day 14). Finally High TDCPP affected gonad maturation, causing a significant increase in ovary follicle development (Day 14) and a transient but marked decrease in testes maturity (Day 7). Taken together these data suggest that dietary exposure to TDCPP and CPF elicits DNA damage in brain and viscera and alters endocrine function in juvenile zebrafish. Importantly, analyses were restricted to the first three time points (Days 0, 7, and 14) due to the emergence a disease among the experimental colony. Although these samples were collected prior to the disease becoming apparent, it remains a potential confounder of the current results.}},

The influence of oxygen depletion on the toxicity of substances was included as an additional interacting factor. To analyse complex interactions, the predator-prey behaviour between zebrafish and chironomid larvae (Chironomus riparius) was investigated. Another aspect of this work were studies on complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as the water accommodated fraction of crude oil, and their effects on the behaviour of marine amphipods (Corophium volutator), as well as semi-field experiments with freshwater amphipods (Gammarus pulex). My investigations showed that effects of various substances in environmentally relevant concentration ranges are exerted on different levels of biological organisation, both in amphipods and fish. It could be shown that abiotic parameters modify the effects of pollutants. When investigating mixtures of substances with similar or different modes of action, additivity occurred in the majority of cases which usually were consistent for all investigated parameters (enzyme activity, locomotor activity, developmental impairment, mortality). Effects of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos on the interactions between fish and chironomids could be detected in environmentally relevant concentration ranges. The effects of the water accommodated fraction of crude oil which represents a great risk for aquatic organisms in costal habitats were displayed by alterations in the behaviour of the marine amphipod Corophium volutator. For a continuous monitoring of water quality in monitoring stations, the resident amphipod Gammarus pulex proved to be a suitable and relevant test organism, as it responds sensitive to complex mixtures of pollutants in surface waters. In summary, behavioural parameters proved to be integrative, relevant and sensitive parameters for the different research topics/questions in the present work, and can also be recommended to be used to analyse interspecific interactions. To judge on the effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms in the environment, abiotic parameters as well as mixtures of pollutants should be included. Additionally, biochemical measurements as well as behavioural tests are important, to adequately assess the toxicity of pollutants. Therefore, for an integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms, a battery of different methods as well as more realistic exposure scenarios should be taken into account.}},
