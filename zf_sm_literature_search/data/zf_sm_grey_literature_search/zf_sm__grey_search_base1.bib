note = {{Given the continually increasing global polymer production, environmental pollution from plastic debris has been widely perceived as an ecological threat with potentially adverse (eco-)toxicological impacts on various species and ecosystems. Especially small fragments of plastic debris measuring 1 <= 1000 {\textmu}m in size - so-called microplastics (MPs) - can pose a risk to biota by physical or chemical hazards due to ingestion, sorption and transfer of anthropogenic environmental pollutants (e.g., pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals). In recent years, there has been extensive research on the impact of streams and rivers as main entry routes for MPs into the marine environment. However, the evidence of adverse effects caused by the intake of MPs and the transfer of contaminants sorbed to MPs into freshwater ecosystems is still not conclusively documented. Therefore, this thesis addressed the impact of microplastic particles in limnic ecosystems by investigating the biological fate and effects of MPs and associated anthropogenic pollutants on different life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). To this end, effects of two common environmental pollutants (benzo(k)fluoranthene, chlorpyrifos) and two synthetic polymers (polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate) were investigated with regard to alterations of complementary biomarkers during acute and chronic exposure, as well as the trophic transfer of MPs and MP-sorbed contaminants from invertebrate organisms to zebrafish and acute toxic effects of MPs pre-exposed in a natural aquatic ecosystem. Overall, the sorption of both anthropogenic pollutants to MPs could be confirmed under various exposure scenarios. In contrast to recent study results, no adverse effects were observed when zebrafish were exposed to clean, pristine polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate. The ingestion of MPs was documented in the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish and did not induce any physiological impairment. The uptake of both pollutants was verified for all investigated species by GC-MS and fluorescence measurements. In the acute exposure scenario using the fish embryo toxicity test (FET), zebrafish embryos displayed sublethal effects and morphological deformities related to the underlying mode of action of benzo(k)fluoranthene and chlorpyrifos. Exposure to MP-associated contaminants significantly reduced malformations and attenuated biomarker responses of acetylcholine esterase activity and CYP450 induction and hence indicated a reduced bioavailability of both pollutants for zebrafish embryos. Chronic exposure of adult zebrafish to both types of MPs and pollutants was designed to assess the potential impact of long-term exposure and possible bioaccumulation of these contaminants of emerging concern. However, exposure to MP-sorbed pollutants failed to alter biomarker responses over the prolonged experimental period. In addition, a novel approach was applied to monitor the uptake of benzo(k)fluoranthene in the intestinal epithelium using confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, no significant bioaccumulation or biotransformation of benzo(k)fluoranthene and chlorpyrifos in brain and liver tissue could be demonstrated using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection and with a high-resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-FLD/HRMS). In order to address the possible vector effects of MPs, the transfer of benzo(k)fluoranthene and polymethyl methacrylate particles in a simplified limnic food web were investigated, consisting of zooplankton (Daphnia magna), sediment-dwelling invertebrates (Chironomus riparius larvae) and zebrafish as highlevel predator. However, the trophic transfer of benzo(k)fluoranthene via MPs could not be confirmed by a combination of highly sensitive fluorescence tracking using CLSM, hepatic CYP450 induction, and advanced chemical-analytical methods. To account for the demand for environmentally relevant exposure scenarios and to improve risk assessment of MPs, a mixture of the most commonly used synthetic polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride) was exposed in a well-monitored surface water body. To evaluate the potential transfer of hazardous pollutants under natural conditions, the toxicity of the MP mixture was assessed in terms of acute toxic effects (FET), potential neurotoxic effects (AChE activity, larval visual motor response test) and effects of dioxin-like substances (EROD assay) using zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, the exposed MP mixture did not elicit significantly different effects than the natural particles from sediment and suspended matter samples. Eventually, it could only be confirmed that MPs could act as carriers for environmental contaminants following ingestion by various organisms. However, increased deleterious effects of MP-sorbed contaminants on various sensitive life stages of zebrafish could not be corroborated by acute or prolonged exposure, trophic transfer, or natural exposure. The findings suggest that the sorption of pollutants to MPs is more likely to reduce the bioavailability as a result of slow desorption within the organism. Although, MPs offer an alternative exposure route for aquatic organisms via ingestion. Even chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations did not induce bioaccumulation of both highly lipophilic substances in zebrafish tissues. Lastly, the sorption behavior of MPs under realistic environmental exposure conditions was more likely to approximate the behavior of natural particles. Consequently, MPs might pose only a limited risk to limnic communities, especially with regard to the comparatively small fraction of plastic particles in freshwater ecosystems compared to the multitude of naturally occurring (a)biotic particles.}},

note = {{Environmental pollution through industrial chemicals or pesticides has emerged as a major health issue for humans and the environment. While several of these chemicals were shown to adversely affect nervous system development, the estimated number of potential neurotoxicants is likely to be much higher. Such developmental perturbations cost society billions of dollars and result in IQ loss in children and several other neurological disorders. As there is currently no cure for such disorders, prevention is essential. Yet, the mechanisms leading to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) are poorly understood, making prevention difficult. Consequently, methods and strategies are required that allow for a fast and reliable screening of potentially neurotoxic or -active substances. With regards to this the zebrafish ($Danio$ $rerio$) embryo has emerged as a model organism. The embryos provide multiple advantageous features, promoting its use in DNT investigations as a non-mammal in vivo test system.In the work at hand, it was hypothesised that zebrafish embryos can be used to generate comprehensive insights into the mechanisms underlying DNT. To reveal these mechanisms, this thesis defined several objectives. First, to assess the applicability of zebrafish embryo behaviour for DNT screens. Therefore, six different insecticides and four endocrine disruptors (EDs) were used. Subsequently, observed behavioural deficits were to be investigated on multiple molecular levels to clarify underlying mechanisms, thus presenting the second goal. Thirdly the applicability of the embryos to lipidome investigations and their relevance for DNT-testing was to be assessed.To accomplish the first goal, it was aimed to increase the information output of one of the most commonly used behaviour assays, the light/ dark transition (LDT) test. Data evaluation was done by integrating multiple parameters at once, thereby retrieving additional information that was indicative for underlying (neuro-) toxic mechanisms.

note = {{Endocrine disruption occurs when specific chemicals interact with internal endocrine signalling pathways in organisms and appears to be particularly widespread in freshwater fish throughout the world. Effects ranged from subtle changes in the physiology and sexual behaviour of fish to permanently altered sexual differentiation and growth, and reproductive impairment. Most attention has been directed towards identifying the main estrogenic chemicals, because many of the effects reported in wildlife appear to be a consequence of {\textquoteleft}feminization{\textquoteright} of males. Environmental estrogens can be anthropogenic, such as certain pharmaceuticals, pesticides and industrial chemicals or natural, such as phyto- and mycoestrogens. Resorcyclic acid lactones (RALs) are the only known class of estrogenic mycotoxins and show estrogenic activity in the range of natural steroid estrogens. RALs occur as secondary metabolites of Fusarium spec. fungi growing on a variety of cereals. Zearalenone (ZON) belongs to the chemical group of RALs and is one of the worldwide most common mycotoxins. The occurrence of mycotoxins has been studied extensively in food, feed products, and domestic animals. Agricultural products around the world exhibited ZON contaminations of up to 69 \% of the tested samples. However, only little is known about the ecotoxicological effects of ZON at concentrations found in the environment. In this research project, the ecotoxicological potential of ZON was evaluated. Effects on fish caused by an exposure to ZON were assessed using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism. An embryo toxicity test was performed to investigate toxic effects of ZON on fish development. This study was complemented with a 30 day zebrafish early life-stage experiment to assess the influence of ZON on juvenile growth. In a second step the estrogenic potency of ZON and its effects on adult fish were examined. A recombinant yeast estrogen screen (rYES) was used as an in vitro assay to determine effects on the activation of estrogen receptor-regulated genes. Zebrafish were exposed to ZON in a 42 day reproduction experiment enabling assessment of reproductive as well as physiological and morphological parameters. In a third step, the estrogenic potency of ZON was studied in a life-cycle experiment. This study was designed to investigate possible effects of continuous long-term exposure including a subsequent depuration period as well as possible transgenerational effects of F0 exposure on F1 generation. The offspring of the F0 generation that was exposed to ZON for 21 days was raised in a 140 day exposure experiment from embryo to adult. In a subsequent 42 day reproduction experiment, spawning groups of the F1 generation were either exposed to ZON (after growing up in clean water) or clean water (after growing up under ZON exposure) and effects on developmental, reproductive as well as physiological parameters were assessed. Exposure to ZON had no effects on embryonic development up to 2000 ng/L, but a positive correlation between the body length and ZON concentration of up to 100 ng/L suggests a growth promoting effect for zebrafish exposed during 30 days. Although ZON revealed a moderate estrogenic potency in vitro (rYES), it exhibited a comparably strong effect on induction of VTG (1000 ng/L) and reproduction (100 ng/L) in vivo during 21 days exposure. It was further demonstrated that ZON influenced growth (1000 ng/L), sexual differentiation (320 ng/L), reproduction (1000 ng/L), and VTG levels (1000 ng/L) in zebrafish exposed from fertilization to day 140. Furthermore, ZON revealed a possible transgenerational effect on growth caused by short-term exposure of F0 and F1 generation each for 21 days to 1000 ng/L. In the framework of this project, relevant data of the ecotoxicological relevance of ZON were collected. The estrogenic potential of ZON was confirmed in vitro and in vivo and detrimental effects on zebrafish reproduction were demonstrated. This indicates that ZON may have an effect on fish populations in the aquatic environment. Effects were observed at concentrations near the maximum measured values in surface waters (approximately double) and below the maximum values measured in effluents (approximately half). Even though to date there is not much data published presenting ZON concentrations in the aquatic environment and effects on different (native) fish species, this project demonstrated that ZON has the potential to pose a threat to fish in the aquatic environment. In a second research project, the embryo toxicity and genotoxicity of biofilm and sediment from the catchment area of a STP was investigated. An embryo toxicity test with zebrafish and the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) with primary cells isolated from the embryos were applied to investigate native biofilm for the first time. Biofilms were sampled from different sections of the sewage system and sediments were taken from the rive Wyna directly at, upstream and downstream of the STP discharge Mittleres Wynental (Switzerland). The aim of this study was to verify the applicability of the aforementioned test system to investigate native biofilm and to evaluate the toxicity of the different sampling sites. Clear differences in the embryo toxicity and genotoxicity of the biofilm from different sewage system sections as well as from the sediment sampling sites were found. Significant genotoxicity was determined in all biofilm and sediment samples. Temporal variability in toxicity were observed in some of the biofilm and sediment samples. Based on the results of this study it can be suggested that biofilm implemented in ecotoxicological bioassays such as the embryo toxicity test and comet assay with zebrafish can be a useful tool to assess (waste) water quality.}},

note = {{Fish are highly dependent on olfaction since a variety of indispensable behaviors are mediated via this sensory modality. Situated in cavities at the dorsal part of the cranium, the fish olfactory epithelium (OE), which contains the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) responsible for odorant detection, is in almost direct contact to the ambient water and thus readily accessible for both odorants and dissolved contaminants. In the last decades, an increasing number of studies demonstrated that numerous pollutants, among them metals and pesticides, are able to impair olfaction in environmentally relevant concentrations, thereby disrupting pivotal behaviors. However, the toxic mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction largely remain unknown and despite the paramount significance of olfaction for fish, olfactory endpoints have not yet been incorporated into the environmental risk assessment of chemicals. The objective of the present Ph.D. thesis was to investigate the impact of three commonly used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, linuron, and permethrin) and cadmium (Cd) on the olfactory system of zebrafish (Danio rerio). In doing so, this thesis further aimed at contributing to the establishment of zebrafish as a model for evaluating olfactory toxicity. In order to enhance the understanding of the toxic mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunctions, the effect of contaminants on the olfactory system was analyzed at different levels of biological organization. Employing quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, it was shown that Cd, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin differentially alter the expression of OSN marker genes in the OE. Furthermore, Cd and chlorpyrifos induced genes associated with stress in the OE, but only Cd increased the expression of such genes in the olfactory bulb (OB). The assessment of second messengers with central roles in olfactory signal transduction showed that linuron decreased the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the OE. The influence of the pollutants on the olfactory mediated ...}},

note = {{Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting seven to ten million people worldwide. Familial forms of PD account for 5-10\% of all PD cases suggesting that other factors such as the environment have a role in the development of sporadic cases of PD. Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for PD. Ziram, a dithiocarbamate fungicide commonly used in California, increases the risk of PD for individuals living and working in areas where the pesticide is sprayed. Ziram has previously been found in vitro to cause selective dopaminergic cell toxicity, inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) levels in primary neuronal cultures. In this dissertation we utilize zebrafish embryos (ZF, Danio rerio) to study ziram in an in vivo system and to determine if ziram{\textquoteright}s toxicity is mediated via synuclein.We found that ziram is toxic to ZF at nanomolar concentrations and caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior in ZF. Since ziram increases α-syn concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF γ-synuclein 1 (γ1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms and ZF γ1 appears to be a functional homologue of α-syn. We found that recombinant ZF γ1 formed fibrils in vitro and overexpression of ZF γ1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity similarly to α-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF γ1 with morpholinos or disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 protected against ziram{\textquoteright}s DA toxicity.Over the course of this dissertation we have demonstrated that ziram is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo and that its toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings provide potentially important mechanistic implications on how ziram and possibly other environmental toxins can contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD.}},

note = {{The Pantanal (Brazil) is one of the largest wetlands in the world and is home to a considerable diversity of aquatic organisms. The region is based on a hydrological cycle where each year the rivers flood extensive areas and periods of drought return the water to the river beds, with important variations in the physicochemical properties of the water of rivers and lagoons. Associated with this it has been observed an increasing growth of agricultural and livestock activities that heavily depend on chemical products (pesticides) to ensure production in the region. The effects of these compounds on the environment, especially in water bodies, are not very well known. Thus, it is important to assess the effects of these compounds on aquatic fauna taking into consideration environmental variation (which can still be exacerbated in a climate change scenario). Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of Barrage{\textregistered}, a cypermethrin-based pesticide widely used in the region in shrimp species (one endemic to the Pantanal) and zebrafish model. In a first phase, effects of pH and nitrite concentrations variation in the toxicity of Barrage{\textregistered} were studied using larvae of Macrobrachium pantanalense, Macrobrachium amazonicum and Danio rerio. In a second phase, histological effects were studied in adults of M. pantanalense. Finally, larvae of Palaemons varians were tested as model for behavioral analysis (locomotion) and behavioral toxicity of Barrage{\textregistered} tested in this species and in D. rerio larvae. The results of this thesis confirm that pH and nitrite modify the toxicity of Barrage{\textregistered} to the tested species, mainly at sublethal level (larval growth and development). Results suggest that lethality may not be sufficient to correctly predict the combined effects of stressors and that inclusion of endemic species is crucial to the correct risk evaluation on sensitive biomas such as Pantanal.

note = {{The field of toxicology is under growing pressure to meet the demand of hazard assessment for the increasingly vast number of environmental toxicants. Due to low throughput and high cost, the traditional toxicity testing strategy, using rodent and higher mammalian animal-based models, is unable to adequately meet these competing demands. Hence, there is increasing recognition of the value of transforming toxicity testing to reduce the usage of mammal models and to more efficiently and reliably predict human relevant toxicity. To this end, a battery approach, integrating diverse in vitro and alternative animal models, was initiated to complement and accelerate hazard assessment. These alternative models are amenable to inexpensive, rapid and robust screening. In this dissertation, I introduce the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a novel alternative animal model to study developmental neurotoxicity. I developed and expanded a fully automated planarian high-throughput (HTS) screening platform to accomplish rapid screening of multiple morphological and behavioral endpoints. This HTS platform was evaluated for robustness, strengths and weaknesses, using an 87-compound library with known and suspected compounds and a 15-compound flame retardant library. As a unique advantage, the similar size of adult and regenerating planarians allows for direct comparison of two worm types to discern development-specific toxicity from overt systemic toxicity. We show that planarian is a useful model to potentially link toxicity pathways to whole-animal adverse functional outcomes by providing a large repertoire of behavioral endpoints. Comparative analysis of the planarian model with other alternative models, including zebrafish, nematode and in vitro cell-based models, provides insight into how different models complement each other in the battery approach. Finally, I discuss our comparative screen of organophosphrous pesticides (OPs) using the expanded platform, to investigate the possible mechanisms of developmental toxicity in OPs. Altogether, by establishing a new alternative animal model this work adds value to the battery approach to accelerate toxicity screening and prioritize toxicants, and provide further insight into the potential mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity.}},

Therefore, when assessing the environmental risk of chemicals, it is important to consider chemical mixtures and their possible interactions. The main objective of this work focused on the environmental risk assessment of pesticides found in the water of the Alqueva reservoir and their binary combinations. In this aquatic ecosystem several pesticides were above of the environmental quality standards. But in addition, there were several sampling points of the reservoir where ecotoxicity was observed despite the presence of these contaminants at low concentrations. Here, a component-based approach was used to assess the effects of the pesticide mixtures. The effects of the binary combinations of four herbicides, atrazine (ATR), terbuthylazine (TER), simazine (SIM) and metolachlor (MET), on the growth rate of the microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the effects of the binary combinations of the s-triazine herbicides ATR and TER and the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) on the swimming behaviour and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of the zebrafish Danio rerio were assessed using the two reference models of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). Moreover, the combined effects of the herbicides (ATR, TER and MET) and the insecticide CPF were also tested on the swimming behaviour and AChE activity of the aquatic midge Chironomus riparius after the cholinesterases characterization. In this risk characterization, the calculated risk quotients for the herbicides ATR, TER, SIM and MET were higher than 1, meaning that these herbicides present a high risk for the Alqueva ecosystem.

Al{\'e}m do mais, o tebuconacol aumentou a express{\~a}o relativa de mRNA da AChE em larvas, no entanto, n{\~a}o alterou em adultos.A exposi{\c c}{\~a}o ao dicl{\'o}rvos, nas fases iniciais do desenvolvimento (1 hpf - 7 dpf), reduziu o tamanho corporal, a taxa de batimentos card{\'\i}acos e a superf{\'\i}cie dos olhos de larvas de 7 dpf, bem como afetou a capacidade de escape de larvas aos 7 e 14 dpf. Al{\'e}m disso, reduziu a capacidade explorat{\'o}ria aos 7 e 14 dpf, padr{\~a}o mantido quando os animais tornaram-se adultos jovens aos 30 dpf, e adultos aos 70 dpf. No entanto, as an{\'a}lises realizadas aos 120 dpf mostraram recupera{\c c}{\~a}o da atividade comportamental similar ao grupo controle. A an{\'a}lise aos 120 dpf da exposi{\c c}{\~a}o ao dicl{\'o}rvos nas fases iniciais do desenvolvimento sobre as enzimas do sistema purin{\'e}rgico mostrou que este inseticida {\'e} capaz de elevar a atividade da ecto-5{\textquoteright}-nucleotidase e reduzir a atividade da ecto-ADA. Os resultados mostram que os agentes neurot{\'o}xicos, tais como Mn, dicl{\'o}rvos e tebuconazol t{\^e}m atua{\c c}{\~a}o significativa sobre o comportamento do peixe-zebra em est{\'a}gio larval e adulto, al{\'e}m de afetar diferentes sistemas de neurotransmiss{\~a}o. Tais altera{\c c}{\~o}es comportamentais podem estar associadas aos d{\'e}ficits observados nos mecanismos neuroqu{\'\i}micos e moleculares investigados. ; Neurotoxic agents, such as pesticides, organic solvents and metals, are capable to alter normal CNS activity. Manganese (Mn) is a metal found in the environment, which when in excess, accumulates in the CNS making it a potential hazard to health. In addition to Mn, other neurotoxic agents can cause changes, leading to deficits in neurotransmission systems. The growth of crop pests has exponentially increased the use of agrochemicals to maintain plantations. The fungicide tebuconazole is a triazole used in crops, such as barley, wheat, peanuts and orchard fruits and related to behavioral and oxidative changes. The insecticide dichlorvos, belongs to organophosphate family, acts through the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) inhibition, leading to hyperstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic system is characterized by the action of acetylcholine(ACh) on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The level of this molecule is regulated by acetylcholinesterase(AChE), which catalyzes degradation of ACh into choline and acetate. Purinergic system is characterized by the action of ATP and adenosine on purinoreceptor P2 and P1, respectively. The levels of these molecules are regulated by ectonucleotidases, which constitute the extracellular cascade for ATP hydrolysis to adenosine. Adenosine can be subsequently deaminated to inosine by action of adenosine deaminase (ADA). Dopamine(DA), synthesized from L-DOPA, is the neurotransmitter of the dopaminergic system and it acts through its D1-D5 receptors, controlling the start and execution of movement. This study aims to evaluate the effects of exposure to manganese and pesticides, such as dichlorvos and tebuconazole, on behavioral parameters in larval and adult zebrafish, as well as its effects on purinergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling. Exposure to MnCl2 in the early stages of development (1 hpf - 5 dpf) was able to reduce the distance traveled, absolute turn angle and mobile time of the larvae at 5, 7 and 10 dpf.In addition, it caused an increase in TH levels at 5 and 7 dpf, followed by a reduction at 10 dpf. There was also an increase in markers of cell death. In adult animals, exposure during 96 hours caused a reduction in distance traveled, number of line crossings and absolute turn angle, and an inhibition on memory acquisition through the inhibitory avoidance task. In addition, adult animals exposed to MnCl2 showed increased levels of markers of cell death, TH and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) in the brain. The 96-hour exposure to this metal was also able to inhibit the NTPDases and ecto-ADA activities and to reduce ADA2.1-mRNA transcripts, besides for increasing ADP levels and reducing the amount of AMP, ADO and INO in the incubation medium. Tebuconazole was able to increase the ocular distance of larvae at 5 dpf and reduce the exploratory behavior of these animals, and still decrease the locomotor activity of 96 hours exposed adult zebrafish. Moreover, this fungicide decreased AChE activity in both 5 dpf larvae and brains of adult animals. Exposure to dichlorvos (1 hpf - 7 dpf) reduced body length, heartbeat rate and larval surface at 7 dpf as well as affected the escape capacity of larvae at 7 and 14 dpf. Further, it reduced exploratory behavior at 7 and 14 dpf, maintaining this pattern when animals became young adults at 30 dpf, and adults at 70 dpf. However, the analysis performed at 120 dpf showed a recovery of behavioral activity equal to the control. In addition, the analysis of exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development at 120 dpf on the enzymes of the purinergic system, showed that this insecticide is able to elevate the ecto-5{\textquoteright}-nucleotidase activity and reduce the ecto-ADA activity.The results showed that neurotoxic agents, such as Mn, dichlorvos and tebuconazole, play a role in the larval and adult behavior of zebrafish, and affect different neurotransmission systems. Such behavioral changes may be associated with the deficits observed in neurochemical and molecular mechanisms investigated.}},

note = {{A paradigm shift has recently occurred in the field of toxicology, transitioning away from traditional mammalian models in favor of time- and cost-efficient alternatives, such as in vitro systems and non-mammalian animal models, which are amenable to high-throughput screening. We have pioneered the asexual freshwater planarian, Dugesia japonica, as an alternative model for developmental neurotoxicology. Planarians have strong regenerative capabilities, wherein after decapitation, the resulting tail piece will regenerate a new head, including a brain, within 2 weeks. Moreover, planarians possess several quantifiable behaviors coordinated by distinct neuronal subpopulations, enabling testing of both adult and developing/regenerating animals with the same assays to directly compare effects on neuronal function. We have established and begun validating the planarian toxicology platform through screens testing 10-87 compounds. We demonstrate that planarians have similar sensitivity to existing alternative animal models, such as developing zebrafish. Planarians are particularly sensitive to pesticides and are good predictors of known developmentally neurotoxic pesticides, such as organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), one of the most used class of pesticides in the world. OPs are acutely toxic due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent cholinergic overstimulation. However, growing evidence suggests that chronic, low dose exposure to OPs, particularly during development, may cause toxicity independent of effects on AChE. Alternative mechanisms of OP developmental neurotoxicity have been proposed, but direct connections between molecular/cellular defects with their functional significance have been limited using traditional models. Our planarian screening platform, on the other hand, is uniquely suited to provide the necessary link between mechanism and functional effects. First, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo properties of planarian cholinesterase and its structural and functional interactions with OPs to contextualize known OP mechanisms. Second, through a comparative screen of 6 OPs and chemicals targeting suggested alternative OP targets, including the endocannabinoid system, cytoskeleton and oxidative stress, we correlate the distinct toxicological profiles of different OPs with specific toxic pathways. Together, these studies demonstrate the utility of the planarian system to the modern toxicology pipeline, through its ability to directly connect mechanisms with their functional significance.}},
