Abstract = {Brazil is the largest producer of sugarcane, a crop largely dependent on
   chemical control for its maintenance. The insecticide fipronil and
   herbicide 2,4-D stand out among the most commonly used pesticides and,
   therefore, environmental consequences are a matter of concern. The
   present study aimed to investigate the toxicity mechanisms of Regent (R)
   800 WG (a.i. fipronil) and DMA (R) 806 BR (a.i. 2,4-D) pesticides using
   forced and non-forced exposures through an integrative approach:
   firstly, to assess whether contamination by fipronil and 2,4-D can
   trigger the avoidance behavior of the fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) and
   Hyphessobrycon eques (serpae tetra or mato-grosso). Additionally, the
   effects on fish were analyzed considering the swimming behavior together
   with a biomarker of neurotoxicity, the activity of acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE). In avoidance tests with pesticide gradients, D. rerio avoided
   the highest concentrations of the two compounds and H. eques avoided
   only the highest concentration of 2,4-D. The swimming behavior (distance
   moved) was reduced and AChE was inhibited when D. rerio was exposed to
   fipronil. The 2,4-D affected the swimming (maximum speed) of H. eques,
   but AChE was not altered.Avoidance response seemed not to have been
   affected by possible effects of contaminants on swimming behavior and
   Ache activity. This study showed the importance of knowing the avoidance
   capacity, swimming behavior and neurotoxic effects of pesticides on fish
   in an integrated and realistic context of exposure in environments
   contaminated with pesticides and can be useful as ecologically relevant
   tools for ecological risk assessment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {DDT Exposure of Zebrafish Embryos Enhances Seizure Susceptibility:
   Relationship to Fetal p,p `-DDE Burden and Domoic Acid Exposure of
   California Sea Lions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2009},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: California sea lions have a large body burden of
   organochlorine pesticides, and over the last decade they have also been
   subject to domoic acid poisoning. Domoic acid poisoning, previously
   recognized in adult animals, is now viewed as a major cause of prenatal
   mortality. The appearance of a chronic juvenile domoic acid disease in
   the sea lions, characterized by behavioral abnormalities and epilepsy,
   is consistent with early life poisoning and may be potentiated by
   organochlorine burden.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated the interactive effect of DDT
   (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on neurodevelopment using a zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) model for seizure behavior to examine the susceptibility
   to domoic acid-induced seizures after completion of neurodevelopment.
   METHODS: Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to either
   o,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) during
   neurodevelopment via a 0.1\% dimethyl sulfoxide solution. These larval
   (7 days postfertilization) fish were then exposed to either the
   seizure-inducing drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or domoic acid; resulting
   seizure behavior was monitored and analyzed for changes using cameras
   and behavioral tracking software.
   RESULTS: Embryonic exposure to DDTs enhanced PTZ seizures and caused
   distinct and increased seizure behaviors to domoic acid, most notably a
   type of head-shaking behavior.
   CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that embryonic exposure to DDTs
   leads to asymptomatic animals at completion of neurodevelopment with
   greater sensitivity to domoic acid-induced seizures. The body burden
   levels of p,p'-DDE are dose to the range recently found in fetal
   California sea lions and suggest a potential interactive effect of
   p,p'-DDE embryonic poisoning and domoic acid toxicity.},

Abstract = {The use of pesticides has been growing along with the demand for
   agricultural products. These compounds, however, are not restricted to
   the field, spreading easily through the soil, contaminating groundwater
   and reaching urban centers. Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that
   has been increasingly used in agriculture. However, there are few data
   about its effects on non-target organisms. This study aimed to evaluate
   the effects of propiconazole in zebrafish. The animals were exposed for
   96 h to different concentrations of propiconazole (425, 850, 1700, 8500
   ng/L), then submitted to the novel tank test for behavioral analyses.
   The brains were collected for evaluation of oxidative stress parameters.
   Exposure to propiconazole (1700 and 8500 ng/L) decreased the number of
   crossings, entries, and time spent in the top, and increased the time
   spent in the bottom area of the tank. We also observed an increase in
   the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in zebrafish brain
   exposed to propiconazole at 425, 850, and 1700 ng/L. We conclude that
   propiconazole alters normal fish behavior and disrupts oxidative status.
   More studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying
   the effects of propiconazole on non-target-organisms.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the sublethal effects of
   propiconazole on Deuterodon iguape, a native fish common in Brazil,
   which has potential for aquaculture and use as a bioindicator. The
   hypothesis was to test whether D. iguape has a metabolism similar to
   Danio rerio so that its use in bioassays may be validated. Lethal
   concentration (LC50) and metabolic rates were studied in fish exposed to
   propiconazole. Specific oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion for D.
   iguape and D. rerio increased by 0.01 mu g L-1 and then decreased as the
   propiconazole concentration increased. The decrease in the averages of
   specific oxygen consumption at the concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1
   represented a reduction in the metabolic rate compared to the control of
   71\% for D. iguape and 40\% D. rerio. For the ammonia excretion, at the
   same concentration, there was a reduction of 68.7\% and 45.4\% for D.
   iguape and D. rerio, respectively. When comparing ammonia excretion of
   the two species for each concentration of propiconazole, there was a
   significant difference (p < 0.05) in relation to the control and for the
   highest concentration (0.1 mu g L-1). As for specific oxygen
   consumption, there was a statistically significant difference only for
   the concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1. D. iguape proved to be a good and
   useful bioindicator for ichthyologists or ecologists in studies of
   moderate pesticide contamination in freshwater aquatic environments, as
   its metabolic response was similar to D. rerio.},

Title = {Do you smell the danger? Effects of three commonly used pesticides on
   the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fish are warned about the presence of predators via an alarm cue
   released from the skin of injured conspecifics. The detection of this
   odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the
   chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed
   the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator
   response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the
   behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following
   24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate
   that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide
   chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing
   behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the
   urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no
   statistically significant effects could be detected. However,
   linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the
   skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors
   such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity.
   Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides
   in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved
   indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that
   pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of
   zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to
   chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Adult exposure to insecticides causes persistent behavioral and
   neurochemical alterations in zebrafish},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Farmers are often chronically exposed to insecticides, which may present
   health risks including increased risk of neurobehavioral impairment
   during adulthood and across aging. Experimental animal studies
   complement epidemiological studies to help determine the
   cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult insecticide exposure
   and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we examined short
   and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an
   organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an
   organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed
   continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 mu M CPF),
   with short- and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and
   at 14 months of age respectively. The behavioral test battery included
   tests of locomotor activity, tap startle, social behavior, anxiety,
   predator avoidance and learning. Long-term effects on neurochemical
   indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two weeks of DDT
   exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a longer
   five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving
   responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at
   14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle
   responses. Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly
   altered by DDT. The two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in
   anxiety-like diving and increases in shoaling responses at the 1-week
   time point, but these effects did not persist through 14 months of age.
   Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in cholinergic
   presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term effects
   including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at 14
   months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time
   point. These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult
   exposure to chronic doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate
   pesticides that can be characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a
   lowcost model that has a variety of advantages for mechanistic studies
   and may be used to expand our understanding of neurobehavioral toxicity
   in adulthood, including the potential for such toxicity to influence
   behavior and development during aging.},

Journal = {BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY},
Abstract = {Studying the bioaccumulation behavior and toxicity of triazole
   fungicides is a crucial part of comprehensively evaluating the
   environmental fate and aquatic toxicity.The current research aimed to
   reveal the toxic effects of propiconazole and difenoconazole on fish
   through acute toxicity test, bioaccumulation test and oxidase system
   activity determination. Here, the propiconazole and difenoconazole
   concentrations were 11.3 mg/L and 31.2 mg/L for LC50-96 h, both having
   low toxicity. LC-MS/MS was used to determine the propiconazole and
   difenoconazole concentrations in five organs (muscle, gill, liver,
   intestine, and kidney) of Procypris meru. The findings indicate that the
   bioconcentration coefficients of propiconazole and difenoconazole in
   grass flower carp were 0.66-27.08 and 2.43-22.72, which belonged to
   medium enrichment pesticides. The bioconcentration coefficients
   decreased with the increase of exposure concentration. The two
   fungicides could induce oxidative stress in fish liver, and the
   activities of three antioxidant enzymes were inhibited in varying
   degrees (p < 0.05). The results showed that the content of T3 increased,
   and T4 decreased when exposed to one-tenth LC50 for 7 days. This study
   shows that triazole pesticides have bioaccumulation risks on aquatic
   organisms and clear environmental hormonal effects.},

   spend more time in the top zone compared with unexposed control fish.
   This clear anxiolytic pattern, in an environmental context, can directly
   impair the ability of fish to avoid or evade predators. We concluded

   354 mu g/L. At the concentration of 1000 mu g/L, the pericardial edema
   was observed in 3-PBA-treated embryos. The inhibition of heart
   development and the reduction of beating rates were observed in
   Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) embryos after the exposure to 3-PBA. Down-regulation of

Abstract = {Azole fungicides have entered the aquatic environment through
   agricultural and residential runoff. In the present study, we compared
   the off-target toxicity of tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil
   using embryo-larval zebrafish as a model. The aim of the present study
   was to investigate the relative toxicity of tebuconazole, propiconazole,
   and myclobutanil using multiple-level endpoints such as behavioral
   endpoints and enzymatic and molecular biomarkers associated with their
   mode of action. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoles at
   environmentally relevant and high concentrations, 0.3, 1.0, and 1000 mu
   g/L, starting at 5 h postfertilization (hpf) up to 48 hpf, as well as 5
   d postfertilization (dpf). Relative mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450
   family 51 lanosterol-14 alpha-demethylase, glutathione S-transferase,
   caspase 9, phosphoprotein p53, and BCL2-associated X protein were
   measured to assess toxicity attributable to fungicides at the mRNA
   level, whereas caspase 3/7 (apoptosis) and 3,4-methylene dioxy
   amphetamine (lipid peroxidation) levels were measured at the enzymatic
   level. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was measure through the
   Mito Stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 at 48 hpf. In addition, light
   to dark movement behavior was monitored at 5 dpf using Danio Vision (R)
   to understand adverse effects at the organismal level. There was no
   significant difference in the light to dark behavior with exposure to
   azoles compared to controls. The molecular biomarkers indicated that
   propiconazole and myclobutanil induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative
   stress, and potentially apoptosis at environmentally relevant
   concentrations (0.3 and 1 mu g/L). The results from the mitochondrial
   respiration assay indicated a slight decrease in spare respiratory

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of three widely used pesticides that
   have been previously detected in aquatic systems neighbouring
   agricultural fields on the early-life stages of the zebrafish Danio
   rerio. Tests involving single exposures and binary combinations of the
   s-triazine herbicides (atrazine and terbuthylazine) and the
   organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos were performed. Several
   endpoints, such as swimming behaviour, morphological abnormalities and
   mortality, were studied. In addition, the inhibition of
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was investigated in order to
   evaluate the mode of action and toxicity of chlorpyrifos in the presence
   of these herbicides. Results indicate that both binary mixtures elicited
   synergistic responses on the swimming behaviour of zebrafish larvae.
   Moreover, although the herbicides were not effective inhibitors of the
   AChE on their own, a synergistic inhibition of the enzyme activity was
   obtained by exposure to mixtures with chlorpyrifos. We observed a
   correlation between impairment of swimming behaviour of the larvae and
   inhibition of AChE activity. This study supports previous studies
   concerning the risk assessment of mixtures since the toxicity may be
   underestimated when looking only at the single toxicants and not their
   mixtures.},

Abstract = {Pyrethroids are potent neurotoxicants that may elicit multiple pathways
   of toxicity in non-target organisms. Comparative studies on the
   mechanistic and developmental effects of types I and II pyrethroids
   against non-target aquatic species are limited. This study assessed the
   effects of the two pyrethroid types against embryo-larval zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) at environmentally relevant and laboratory concentrations.
   Zebrafish embryos were exposed to type-I (permethrin, bifenthrin) and
   type-II(deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, fenvalerate, esfenvalerate)
   pyrethroids at 1000,10, 0.1, 0.01, 0.0 mu g/L, starting at 5-h
   post-fertilization (hpf) through 5-d post-fertilization (dpf) under
   static exposure conditions. Swimming behavior (distance traveled and
   velocity) was assessed at 5-dpf. The relative expression of Nrf2a, GST,
   Casp-9 and p53 mRNA transcripts, carboxyl esterase (CES) activity and
   total reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. The stability of the
   pyrethroids across 5 days was analyzed. Bifenthrin-(10 mu g/L) and
   esfenvalerate-(1000 mu g/L) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total
   distance traveled by larvae while 1000 mu g/L deltamethrin and
   lambda-cyhalothrin were lethal causing body axis curvature and
   pericardial edema. At environmentally relevant concentrations-(mu g/L)
   compared to control, permethrin-(0.122) upregulated Nrf2a and Casp-9
   expressions while lambda-cyhalothrin-(0.053) downregulated Nrf2a and
   fenvalerate-0.037 downregulated GST. At laboratory concentrations-(mu
   g/L), permethrin-(1000) upregulated Nrf2a, Casp-9 and p53 expressions,
   bifenthrin-(10) upregulated Casp-9 while fenvalerate-(0.1) and
   esfenvalerate-(1000) downregulated GST. There was concentration
   dependent increase in CES activity which correlated positively with
   total ROS. Pyrethroid concentrations decreased significantly by day 5.
   This study showed disparity in the mechanistic effects across the
   pyrethroids types and their instability in aqueous media may
   underestimate toxicity against non-target aquatic species when exposed
   in their natural environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Pyrethroid pesticides constitute one of the main types of pesticides in
   the domestic market. Deltamethrin, one of the typically used pyrethroid
   pesticides, has high insecticidal activity, and a wide insecticidal
   spectrum, and is widely used in agricultural production and other
   activities. A previous study showed deltamethrin to have obvious toxic
   effects on zooplankton, fish and other aquatic organisms. In the current
   work, we used fish of the model organism Danio rerio to comprehensively
   evaluate the effects of deltamethrin on their behavior, physiology and
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. During the initial reaction of the
   fish to the presence of deltamethrin, their behaviors were found to
   change with the drug concentration, which directly showed the toxic
   effect of this pesticide on the fish. The AChE activity of the fish
   showed a response similar to that of their behavior. Moreover,
   deltamethrin caused significant damage to their gills and liver.
   However, being major organs of Danio rerio, the gills and liver showed a
   different response pattern than did the behavior of the fish.},

Abstract = {Synthetic organic insecticides, including pyrethroids, organophosphates,
   neonicotinoids and other types, have the potential to alter the
   ecosystems and many are harmful to humans. This study examines the
   developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of three synthetic organic
   insecticides, including deltamethrin (DM), acephate (AP), and
   thiamethoxam (TM), using embryo-larval stages of zebrafish (Danio
   rerio). Results showed that DM exposure led to embryo development delay
   and a significant increase in embryo mortality at 24 and 48 h
   post-fertilization (hpf). DM and AP decreased embryo chorion surface
   tension at 24 hpf, along with the increase in hatching rate at 72 hpf.
   Moreover, DM caused ntl, shh, and krox20 misexpression in a
   dose-dependent manner with morphological deformities of shorter body
   length, smaller eyes, and larger head-body angles at 10 mu g/L. TM did
   not show significant developmental toxicity. Furthermore, results of
   larval rest/wake assay indicated that DM (>0.1 mu g/L) and AP (0.1 mg/L)
   increased activity behavior with different patterns. Interestingly, as
   an insect-specific pesticide, TM still could alter locomotor activity in
   zebrafish larvae at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L Our results
   indicate that different types of synthetic organic insecticides could
   create different toxicity outcomes in zebrafish embryos and larvae. (C)

Abstract = {Atrazine and Diuron are widely used herbicides. The use of pesticides
   contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and
   non-target organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of acute exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron
   commercial formulations in zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos
   and larvae and adult stages. We observed a significant
   concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching delays in animals
   exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of malformations
   compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included cardiac
   edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days
   post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in
   the head length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance
   at 1, 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same
   age, diuron increased the ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron
   (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects were observed on the head length. We
   also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in larvae at 7 dpf, and there
   were no significant differences in distance traveled, mean speed, time
   in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when animals were
   individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of the
   larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and
   neither atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups
   were compared to their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was
   evaluated 7 and 8 days after the end of the acute herbicide exposure.
   Exploration of a new environment and associated anxiety-like parameters,
   social interaction, and aggressiveness were not altered. Our results
   highlight the need for further studies on the sublethal effects of both
   herbicides and the consideration of the effects of commercial formulas
   vs. isolated active ingredients. It also emphasizes the need to take
   sublethal effects into consideration when establishing the environmental
   limits of residues.},

Abstract = {Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide used in agriculture. Via run-off,
   it can enter the aquatic environment, and can adversely affect
   organisms. However, data are scarce on how propiconazole may affect
   early developmental life stages of fish. The objectives of this study
   were to evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of propiconazole
   during zebrafish development. Wildtype zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos
   and larvae were exposed to propiconazole (0.1-100 mu M) for up to 150
   hours post fertilization (hpf) depending upon the endpoint measured.
   Propiconazole decreased survival and induced hypopigmentation in fish at
   100 mu M compared to the water and solvent controls. Pericardial edema
   was also noted in embryos and larvae (beginning at 2-3 dpf) exposed to
   100 mu M propiconazole. To visualize the effects of propiconazole on the
   circulatory system in more detail, we exposed transgenic zebrafish
   (globin-LCR:eGFP) to the fungicide. Hematopoietic changes were observed
   within 48 h of exposure to 100 mu M and localization of blood cells in
   the cardic region became diffuse, indicating pooling of blood in the
   pericardial region. We measured oxidative respiration in embryos as
   sufficient ATP is needed for development. Exposure to 100 mu M
   propiconazole (similar to 6-30 hpf) reduced basal respiration (similar
   to 50\%), oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration (similar to 70\%),
   proton leak (similar to 30\%), and non-mitochondrial respiration
   (similar to 50\%), indicating compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. A
   Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was used to measure dark photokinesis
   behavior in larval fish exposed to propiconazole for a 6-day period.
   Larval fish exposed to the highest concentration in the assay (10 mu M)
   showed evidence of hypoactivity. This study demonstrates that
   propiconazole can induce hypopigmentation in zebrafish, disrupt
   mitochondrial bioenergetics, and can alter locomotor activity. However,
   these sub-lethal responses were observed at concentrations above what is
   typically detected in the environment.},

Abstract = {As behavior shows a distinct circadian rhythm, it is hypothesized that
   circadian rhythms based on zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior responses
   could be affected by contaminants in this study, and then the behavior
   strength of zebrafish exposed to 0.005 mg/L Cadmium chloride (CdCl2),
   0.01 mg/L Dibasic Sodium Phosphate (Na2HPO4), 0.002 mg/L deltamethrin,
   and 0.003 mg/L atrazine for 6 days is used to illustrate the possibility
   of behavior circadian rhythms as an indicator in the environmental
   stress assessment. Statistical analysis with p < 0.01 shows that a clear
   difference between average values of BS during dark period (AVD) and
   those during light period (AVL) could be observed, and 24 h circadian
   rhythms do exist in zebrafish behavior responses. Both BS values and
   circadian rhythms of zebrafish can be affected in the aspect of
   periodicity with clear time delay, which were 1 h delay in CdCl2, 4 h
   delay in Na2HPO4, 4 h delay in deltamethrin, and 1 h delay in atrazine.
   Behavior circadian rhythms were disturbed according to the repetitive
   cycles after autocorrelation analysis, and the toxic effects of
   different chemicals could be reflected by the profiles of the
   Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which indicated the circadian rhythm disorder
   in different degrees. These results deduced from the statistical
   analysis, autocorrelation and SOM strongly supported that circadian

Title = {Zebrafish Seizure Model Identifies p,p `-DDE as the Dominant Contaminant
   of Fetal California Sea Lions That Accounts for Synergistic Activity
   with Domoic Acid},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {118},
Number = {4},
Pages = {545-551},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fetal poisoning of California sea lions (CSLs; Zalophus
   californianus) has been associated with exposure to the algal toxin
   domoic acid. These same sea lions accumulate a mixture of persistent
   environmental contaminants including pesticides and industrial products
   such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers (PBDEs). Developmental exposure to the pesticide
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its stable metabolite
   1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE) has been shown to
   enhance domoic acid induced seizures in zebrafish; however, the
   contribution of other co-occurring contaminants is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE: We formulated a mixture of contaminants to include PCBs,
   PBDEs, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and chlordane at levels matching
   those reported for fetal CSL blubber to determine the impact of
   co-occurring persistent contaminants with p,p'-DDE on chemically induced
   seizures in zebrafish as a model for the CSLs.
   METHODS: Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to p,p'-DDE in
   the presence or absence of a defined contaminant mixture prior to
   neurodevelopment via either bath exposure or embryo yolk sac
   microinjection. After brain maturation (7 days postfertilization), fish
   were exposed to a chemical convulsant, either pentylenetetrazole or
   domoic acid; resulting seizure behavior was then monitored and analyzed
   for changes, using cameras and behavioral tracking software.
   RESULTS: Induced seizure behavior did not differ significantly between
   subjects with embryonic exposure to a contaminant mixture and those
   exposed to p,p'-DDE only.
   CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that p,p'-DDE in the absence of
   PCBs, HCH, chlordane, and PBDEs that co-occur in fetal sea lions
   accounts for the synergistic activity that leads to greater sensitivity
   to domoic acid seizures.},

Title = {Neurobehavioral anomalies in zebrafish after sequential exposures to DDT

Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {A sequence of different classes of synthetic insecticides have been used
   over the past 70 years. Over this period, the widely-used
   organochlorines were eventually replaced by organophosphates, with
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the
   principal prototypes. Considerable research has characterized the risks
   of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about the toxicology of
   transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has been
   commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used
   adult zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week
   chronic exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure
   (DDT for 5 weeks followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the
   exposure period, a subset of fish were analyzed for brain cholinesterase
   activity. Behavioral effects were initially assessed one week following
   the end of the CPF exposure and again at 14 months of age using a
   behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses, anxiety-like
   functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult insecticide
   exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate multiple
   behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,
   predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition
   and avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each
   impacted to a greater degree by the sequential exposures than by
   individual compounds, with the latter being pronounced at the early
   (1-week post exposure) time point, but not 3-4 months later in aging.
   Social approach responses were similarly impaired by the sequential
   exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing responses in
   the predator test showed fleeenhancing effects of both compounds
   individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two
   following sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with
   changes in recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place
   recognition task in late adulthood, but sequential exposures did not
   enhance these phenotypes. The potential for chemical x chemical
   interactions did not appear related to changes in CPF metabolism to the
   active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the cholinesterase
   inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects of
   chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health
   initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential
   exposures may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.},

   and larvae. After conducting the fish embryo toxicity test, three
   concentrations (1, 2 and 3.5 mg L-1 for diazinon and 1, 2 and 3.8 mg L-1
   for diuron) were evaluated for effects on embryonic spontaneous movement
   and heartbeat, larval light -dark transition response, and thigmotaxis.
   Although the modes -of -action are different, both pesticides proved to
   be moderately toxic to early life stages of zebrafish with 96 h LC50 of
   approximately 6.5 mg L-1 and similar EC50 values of approximately 4 mg
   L-1. Changes in behavioral endpoints were detected 24 h of exposure,
   suggesting that behavioral measurements can serve as sensitive and early
   indicators of pesticide exposure. Changes in behavior, such as decrease
   in spontaneous coiling movements of embryos and reduction of thigmotaxis
   in larvae, were pronounced for diuron, indicating the usefulness of the
   application of behavioral endpoints to assess the effects of other
   herbicides. In the case of diazinon, the effects were less prominent,
   but the detected changes in ratios between activity in light and
   darkness also point to the possibility of using behavioral changes for
   evaluation of insecticide effects. The obtained results support the
   usage of behavioral endpoints in zebrafish embryos and larvae for the
   detection of early effects of pesticides. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Developmental exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of
   bifenthrin alters transcription of mTOR and ryanodine receptor-dependent
   signaling molecules and impairs predator avoidance behavior across early

Abstract = {Altered transcription of calcium-dependent signaling cascades involving
   the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
   in response to environmental exposures have been described in model
   vertebrates, including zebrafish, while the relevance for wild fishes
   remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed the
   euryhaline model species Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to the
   insecticide bifenthrin, a known modulator of calcium signaling. The main
   objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether exposure of
   developing silversides to environmentally relevant concentrations of
   bifenthrin alters their behavior; and (2) whether behavioral changes
   correlate with altered expression of genes involved in RyR and
   mTOR-dependent signaling pathways. At six hours post fertilization
   (hpf), inland silversides were exposed to bifenthrin at 3, 27 and 122
   ng/L until 7 days post fertilization (dpf, larvae hatched at 6dpf),
   followed by a 14-day recovery period in uncontaminated water.
   Transcriptional responses were measured at 5, 7 and 21 dpf; locomotor
   behavior following external stimuli and response to an olfactory
   predator cue were assessed at 7 and 21 dpf. Bifenthrin elicited
   significant non-monotonic transcriptional responses in the majority of
   genes examined at 5 dpf and at 21 dpf. Bifenthrin also significantly
   altered predator avoidance behavior via olfactory mechanisms with main
   effects identified for animals exposed to 3 and 27 ng/L. Behavioral
   effects were not detected in response to visual stimuli during acute
   exposure, but were significant in the predator-cue assessment following
   the recovery period, suggesting delayed and long-term effects of early
   developmental exposures to bifenthrin. Our findings demonstrate that at
   picomolar (pM) concentrations, which are often not represented in
   ecotoxi-cological studies, bifenthrin perturbs early development of
   inland silversides. These developmental impacts are manifested
   behaviorally at later life stages, specifically as altered patterns of
   predator avoidance behavior, which have been correlated with population
   decline. Collectively, these data suggest that bifenthrin may be
   negatively impacting wild fish populations.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin has
   been increasingly employed for pest control in urban and agricultural
   areas, putting humans and wildlife at increased risk of exposure.
   Exposures to nanomolar (nM) concentrations of bifenthrin have recently
   been reported to alter calcium oscillations in rodent neurons. Neuronal
   calcium oscillations are influenced by ryanodine receptor (RyR)
   activity, which modulates calcium-dependent signaling cascades,
   including the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.
   RyR activity and mTOR signaling play critical roles in regulating
   neurodevelopmental processes. However, whether environmentally relevant
   levels of bifenthrin alter RyR or mTOR signaling pathways to influence
   neurodevelopment has not been addressed. Therefore, our main objectives
   in this study were to examine the transcriptomic responses of genes
   involved in RyR and mTOR signaling pathways in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
   exposed to low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin, and to assess the
   potential functional consequences by measuring locomotor responses to
   external stimuli. Wildtype zebrafish were exposed for 1, 3 and 5 days to
   1, 10 and 50 ng/L bifenthrin, followed by a 14 d recovery period.
   Bifenthrin elicited significant concentration-dependent transcriptional
   responses in the majority of genes examined in both signaling cascades,
   and at all time points examined during the acute exposure period (1, 3,
   and 5 days post fertilization; dpf), and at the post recovery assessment
   time point (19 dpf). Changes in locomotor behavior were not evident
   during the acute exposure period, but were observed at 19 dpf, with main
   effects (increased locomotor behavior) detected in fish exposed
   developmentally to bifenthrin at 1 or 10 ng/L, but not 50 ng/L. These
   findings illustrate significant influences of developmental exposures to
   low (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin on neurodevelopmental processes
   in zebrafish.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the need for the development of alternative test
   methods for the conventional acute fish toxicity test (AFT) with adult
   fish has often been discussed. In addition, concerns have been raised on
   the potential risks related with environmentally realistic pesticide
   mixtures since risk evaluations have traditionally been based on
   individual pesticides. The insecticide/acaricide abamectin and the
   fungicide difenoconazole are the main pesticides that are intensively
   used in Brazilian strawberry crop and are hence likely to occur
   simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies. The aim of the present
   study was therefore to evaluate the lethal and sublethal toxicity of
   single and mixture exposures of these pesticides to zebrafish early life
   stages (embryos and juveniles). By comparing the derived toxicity data
   of the individual compounds with that previously determined for
   zebrafish adults, the order of life stage sensitivity was juvenile >
   adult> embryo. The pesticide mixture revealed a dose-level dependent
   deviation of the independent action model, with antagonism at low dose
   levels and synergism at high dose levels. Sublethal parameters
   (especially those related with locomotion) were considerably more
   sensitive than lethality. Subsequently, the inclusion of sublethal
   parameters may greatly improve the sensitivity of FET tests and hence
   its suitability as a substitution of adult fish testing in risk
   assessment evaluations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Pesticide commercial mixtures, including the insecticide fipronil and
   the fungicides pyraclostrobin and methyl-thiophanate, have been used in
   concomitant pest control, facilitating agricultural management. Their
   widespread use can lead to soil and water contamination and potentially
   induce damages in the ecosystem, producing toxic effects in non-target
   organisms. Despite their toxicological potential, their effects on
   behavioral and biochemical parameters are not well understood. Here we
   investigated the effects of the mixture of fipronil and fungicides (MFF)
   pyraclostrobin and methyl- thiophanate on behavioral and biochemical
   parameters of oxidative stress in adult zebrafish. Animals exposed to
   the highest MFF tested concentration showed a decrease in the total
   distance traveled and in the number of crossings in the different zones
   of the tank. Furthermore, animals exposed to highest MFF tested
   concentration spent more time in water surface. In addition, our data
   showed that the exposure to this preparation promoted a decrease in
   non-protein thiol content as well as in catalase activity. Finally,
   pesticide exposure induced an increase in the superoxide
   dismutase/catalase ratio. Our results indicate that alterations in
   behavioral and oxidative parameters are involved in MFF toxicity in
   zebrafish. The antioxidant mechanisms analyzed were altered in
   concentrations that did not affect zebrafish behavior. Therefore, the
   assessment of oxidative stress parameters in zebrafish brains could be
   very useful to detect the early effects of environmental exposure to the
   MFF.},

Title = {Residual molecular and behavioral effects of the phenylpyrazole
   pesticide fipronil in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) following a pulse
   embryonic exposure},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS \& PROTEOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pesticides are typically applied to crops as acute applications, and
   residual effects of such intermittent exposures are not often
   characterized in developing fish. Fipronil is an agricultural pesticide
   that inhibits gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) gated chloride channels.
   In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 48 h
   (starting at similar to 3 h post fertilization, hpf) to various
   concentrations of fipronil (0.02 mu g/L up to 4000 mu g/L). Following
   this acute exposure, a subset of fish was transferred to clean water for
   a 7-day depuration phase. We hypothesized that a pulse exposure to
   fipronil during critical periods of central nervous system development
   would adversely affect fish later in life. After a 48 hour pulse
   exposure, survival was reduced in embryos exposed to 2 mu g fipronil/L
   or greater. However, there was no further mortality during the
   depuration phase, nor were there changes in body length nor notochord
   length in larvae 9 dpf (days post-fertilization) compared to controls.
   Additional experiments were carried out at higher concentrations over 96
   h (up to 4 dpf) to also elucidate developmental effects and
   teratogenicity of fipronil (43.7 mu g/L up to 4370 mu g/L). Fipronil at
   these higher concentrations significantly impacted the development of
   zebrafish, and the following morphometric and teratogenic effects were
   observed in 4 dpf fish; reduced body length, yolk sac and pericardial
   edema, reduced midbrain length, reduced optic and otic diameter, and
   truncation of the lower jaw. In depurated fish, we hypothesized that
   there would exist residual effects of exposure at the molecular level.
   Transcriptome profiling was therefore conducted on 9 dpf depurated
   larvae exposed initially for 48 h to one dose of either 0.2 mu g/L, 200
   mu g/L or 2000 mu g/L fipronil. The expression of gene networks
   associated with glycogen and omega-3-fatty acid metabolism were
   decreased in larvae exposed to each of the three concentrations of
   fipronil, suggesting metabolic disruption. Moreover, transcriptomics
   revealed that fipronil suppressed gene networks related to light-dark
   adaptation, photoperiod sensing, and circadian rhythm. Based on these
   data, we tested fish for altered behavioral responses in a Light-Dark
   preference test. Larvae exposed to > 200 mu g fipronil/L as embryos
   showed fewer number of visits (20-30\% less) to the dark zone compared
   to controls. Larvae also spent a lower amount of time in the dark zone
   compared to controls, suggesting that fipronil strengthened dark
   avoidance behavior which is indicative of anxiety. This study
   demonstrates that a short pulse exposure to fipronil can affect
   transcriptome networks for metabolism, circadian rhythm, and response to
   light in fish after depuration, and these molecular responses are
   hypothesized to be related to aberrant behavioral effects observed in
   the light-dark preference test.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that organophosphates and carbamates affect human
   fetal development, resulting in neurological and growth impairment.
   However, these studies are conflicting and the extent of adverse effects
   due to pesticide exposure warrants further investigation. In the present
   study, we examined the impact of the carbamate insecticide propoxur on
   zebrafish development. We found that propoxur exposure delays embryonic
   development, resulting in three distinct developmental stages: no delay,
   mild delay, or severe delay. Interestingly, the delayed embryos all
   physically recovered 5 days after exposure, but behavioral analysis
   revealed persistent cognitive deficits at later stages. Microarray
   analysis identified 59 genes significantly changed by propoxur
   treatment, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that these genes are
   involved in cancer, organismal abnormalities, neurological disease, and
   hematological system development. We further examined hspb9 and hspb11
   due to their potential roles in zebrafish development and found that
   propoxur increases expression of these small heat shock proteins in all
   of the exposed animals. However, we discovered that less significant
   increases were associated with the more severely delayed phenotype. This
   raises the possibility that a decreased ability to upregulate these
   small heat shock proteins in response to propoxur exposure may cause
   embryos to be more severely delayed.},

Abstract = {In agriculture intensive areas, fishponds and natural water bodies
   located in close proximity to these fields receive water with variable
   amounts of agrichemicals. Consequently, toxic compounds reach nontarget
   organisms. For instance, aquatic organisms can be exposed to
   tebuconazole-based fungicides (TBF), glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH),
   and atrazine-based herbicides (ABH) that are potentially dangerous,
   which motivates the following question: Are these agrichemicals
   attractant or aversive to fish? To answer this question, adult zebrafish
   were tested in a chamber that allows fish to escape from or seek a lane
   of contaminated water. This attraction and aversion paradigm was
   evaluated with zebrafish in the presence of an acute contamination with
   these compounds. We showed that only GBH was aversive to fish, whereas
   ABH and TBF caused neither attraction nor aversion for zebrafish. Thus,
   these chemicals do not impose an extra toxic risk by being an attractant
   for fish, although TBF and ABH can be more deleterious, because they
   induce no aversive response. Because the uptake and bioaccumulation of
   chemicals in fish seems to be time- and dose-dependent, a fish that
   remains longer in the presence of these substances tends to absorb
   higher concentrations than one that escapes from contaminated sites.},

Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Salinity can interact with organic compounds and modulate their
   toxicity. Studies have shown that the fraction of pyrethroid
   insecticides in the aqueous phase increases with increasing salinity,
   potentially increasing the risk of exposure for aquatic organisms at
   higher salinities. In the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD) estuary,
   pyrethroid concentrations increase during the rainy season, coinciding
   with the spawning season of Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an
   endangered, endemic fish. Furthermore, salinity intrusion in the SFBD is
   exacerbated by global climate change, which may change the dynamics of
   pyrethroid toxicity on aquatic animals. Therefore, examining the effect
   of salinity on the sublethal toxicity of pyrethroids is essential for
   risk assessments, especially during the early life stages of estuarine
   fishes. To address this, we investigated behavioral effects of
   permethrin and bifenthrin at three environmentally relevant
   concentrations across a salinity gradient (0.5, 2 and 6 PSU) on Delta
   Smelt yolk-sac larvae. Our results suggest that environmentally relevant
   concentrations of pyrethroids can perturb Delta Smelt larvae behavior
   even at the lowest concentrations (<1 ng/L) and that salinity can change
   the dynamic of pyrethroid toxicity in terms of behavioral effects,
   especially for bifenthrin, where salinity was positively correlated with
   anti-thigmotaxis at each concentration.},

   development in rodents. This compound is employed mainly to eliminate
   outbreaks of the genusAedes, even in potable water. Despite the
   increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and
   insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few
   studies about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as
   fish. This study evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral,
   cognitive, and endocrine parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult
   zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen (Pestanal(R)) concentrations (0.125,
   0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed behavioral parameters,
   memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor
   (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after pyriproxyfen
   exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean
   speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the
   tank or time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive
   behavior. However, there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all
   tested pyriproxyfen concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in
   exposed groups when compared to control or vehicle. However,grandcrfgene
   expression in pyriproxyfen-treated animals were unaltered when compared
   to control or vehicle groups. Taken together, these findings indicate
   that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive impairment and altered cortisol
   levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.},

Title = {Combined treatment of melatonin and sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate
   reduced the neurological and cardiovascular toxicity induced by
   deltamethrin in zebrafish},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {243},

Abstract = {The pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin has been reported to have an
   effect on vertebrate development and cardiovascular disease. Sodium
   tanshinone HA sulfonate (STS) is considered to have cardioprotective
   effects and melatonin is known to regulate sleep-waking cycles. In this
   experiment, we used transgenic zebrafish Tg (kdrl:mCherry) and Tg
   (my17:GFP) to investigate whether STS and melatonin could reverse the
   cardiovascular toxicity and neurotoxicity induced by deltamethrin.
   Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 25 mu g/L deltamethrin at 10 hpf and
   treated with 100 mmolil. STS and 1 mu mol/L melatonin showed that
   deltamethrin treatment affected normal cardiovascular development. In
   situ hybridization and qRT-PCR results showed that deltamethrin could
   interfere with the normal expression of cardiovascular
   development-related genes vegfr2, shh, gata4, nkx2.5, causing functional
   defects in the cardiovascular system. In addition, deltamethrin could
   affect the sleep-waking behavior of larvae, increasing the activity of
   larvae, decreasing the rest behavior and the expression of hcrt, hcrtr,
   aanat2 were down-regulated. The addition of melatonin and STS can
   significantly alleviate cardiovascular toxicity and sleep-waking induced
   by deltamethrin, while restoring the expression of related genes to
   normal levels. Our study demonstrates the role of STS and melatonin in
   protecting cardiovascular and sleep-waking behavior caused by
   deltamethrin. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {zebrafish, during embryo, larvae and adult stages were selected to
   investigate the potential environmental risk and aquatic toxicity of a
   widely used fungicide, difenoconazole. In addition to mortality, embryo
   development endpoints, teratogenic effects and behavior abnormity were

   toxicity of difenoconazole to the three phases of zebrafish were larvae
   (1.17 mg/L) > adult fish (1.45 mg/L) > embryo (2.34 mg/L). A large suite
   of symptoms was induced in embryonic development by different dosages of
   difenoconazole, including hatching inhibition, abnormal spontaneous
   movement, slow heart rate, growth regression and morphological
   deformities. 0.50 mg/L of difenoconazole could cause significant body
   color blackening and decrease in the heart rate of zebrafish larvae over
   24 h. In addition, 025 mg/L of difenoconazole apparently inhibited the
   growth weight of adult zebrafish measured after 14 days' exposure. (C)

   fish to escape predation under low doses of exposure},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Biomarkers are frequently used in ecotoxicology as they allow to study
   toxicant effects happening at low concentrations of exposure. However,
   most sublethal studies only evaluate cellular biomarkers which lack
   evident ecological relevance. We used a multibiomarker approach to
   estimate the toxic effects of ethoprophos, an organophosphate
   insecticide commonly used in banana plantations, on the tropical fish
   Astyanax aeneus (Characidae). We measured biomarkers at sub-individual
   (cellular) and individual (metabolism, behavior) levels and examined
   relationships among these responses. A sublethal exposure to ethoprophos
   caused a significant (54\%) reduction of brain Cholinesterase (ChE)
   activity, reflecting the pesticide's high neurotoxicity. However, other
   biomarkers like oxidative stress, biotransformation reactions, and
   resting metabolic rate were not affected. Exposure to ethoprophos
   modified antipredator behaviors such as escape response and detection
   avoidance (light/dark preference): exposed fish escaped slower from a
   simulated attack and preferred brighter areas in a novel tank. The
   relationship between ChE activity and reaction time suggests that
   pesticide-induced ChE inhibition reduces escape ability in fish. Our
   results provide evidence that impacts of organophosphate pesticides on
   fish ecological fitness can occur even with short exposures at very low
   concentrations.},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the effects of tebuconazole on morphology
   and exploratory larvae behavior and adult locomotion. Furthermore, we
   analyzed the effects of this fungicide on AChE activity and gene
   expression in zebrafish larvae and in the adult zebrafish brain.
   Tebuconazole (4 mg/L) increased the ocular distance in larvae and
   reduced the distance travelled, absolute turn angle, line crossing and
   time outside area in exposed larvae. Moreover, adult zebrafish that were
   exposed to this fungicide (4 and 6 mg/L) showed a decrease in distance
   travelled and mean speed when compared to the control group. However,
   tebuconazole did not alter the number of line crossings or time spent in
   the upper zone. Tebuconazole inhibited AChE activity at concentrations
   of 4 mg/L for larvae and 4 and 6 mg/L in the adult zebrafish brain.
   However, this fungicide did not alter AChE gene expression in the adult
   zebrafish brain but increased AChE mRNA transcript levels in larvae.
   These findings demonstrated that tebuconazole could modulate the
   cholinergic system by altering AChE activity and that this change may be
   associated with the reduced locomotion of these animals. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Behavior responses of organisms can be used as a non-invasive method for
   neurotoxicology studies since it directly links the nervous system's
   functioning and biochemical activities. Among different behavioral
   activities, aquatic organisms' swimming behavior (fitness) is the
   essential factor for health assessment; thus, it is practiced routinely
   in neurotoxicological studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are excellent
   models for neurotoxicology studies. Based on the above information, we
   hypothesized that zebrafish's swimming behavior is a potential biomarker
   for neurotoxic effect assessment. We exposed zebrafish (length, 3-4 cm;
   weight, 0.2-0.3 g) to different synthetic organic chemicals
   (organophosphorus flame retardants (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl
   diphenyl phosphate) and neurotoxic pesticides (cypermethrin and
   methomyl) for 15 days. For each test chemical, we chose two different
   concentrations (Treatment-I 5 mu L/L and Treatment-II 25 mu L/L) to
   study their eco-toxicity. The swimming strength of zebrafish was
   quantified using an online monitoring system. The swimming strength of
   zebrafish decreased under different treatments (Treatment-I (5 mu L/L)
   and -II (25 mu L/L)) of target chemicals. The circadian rhythm of
   zebrafish was predominantly not affected in this study. Higher
   neurotoxic effect (behavioral impairment) was observed in Treatment-II
   when compare to Treatment-I of organophosphorus flame retardants and
   pesticides groups. Responses of zebrafish under organophosphorus flame
   retardant (tri-cresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl phosphate)
   treatments were identical with pesticide (cypermethrin and methomyl)
   treatments. Based on the results, we conclude that swimming behavior
   could be an ideal non-invasive biomarker to assess waterborne
   contaminants' neurotoxic effect.},

Title = {The pyrethroid esfenvalerate induces hypoactivity and decreases dopamine
   transporter expression in embryonic/larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {243},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Esfenvalerate is a pyrethroid insecticide used widely for agricultural
   and residential applications. This insecticide has been detected in
   aquatic environments at concentrations that can induce sub-lethal
   effects in organisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were used to
   examine the effects of environmentally-relevant concentrations of
   esfenvalerate on development and behavior. It was hypothesized that
   esfenvalerate exposure would impair locomotion due to its effects on the
   central nervous system. We also measured mitochondrial bioenergetics and
   the expression of genes (dopamine system) as putative mechanisms of
   locomotor impairment. Concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mu g/L
   esfenvalerate did not induce significant mortality nor deformity in
   zebrafish, but there was an acceleration in hatching time for zebrafish
   exposed to 2 mu g/L esfenvalerate. As an indicator of neurotoxicity, the
   Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was conducted with 5, 6, and 7 dpf
   zebrafish after continuous exposure, and higher concentrations were used
   (4 and 8 mu g/L esfenvalerate) to better discern age-and dose dependent
   responses in behavior. Experiments revealed that, unlike the other
   stages, 6 dpf larvae showed evidence for hypo-activity with
   esfenvalerate, suggesting that different stages of larval development
   may show increased sensitivity to pyrethroid exposure. This may be
   related to age-dependent maturation of the central nervous system. We
   hypothesized that reduced larval activity may be associated with
   impaired production of ATP and the function of mitochondria at earlier
   life stages, however dramatic alterations in oxidative phosphorylation
   were not observed. Based on evidence that dopamine regulates behavior
   and studies showing that other pyrethroids affect dopamine system, we
   measured transcripts involved in dopaminergic signaling. We found that
   dopamine active transporter was down-regulated with 0.2 mu g/L
   esfenvalerate. Lastly, we comprehensively summarize the current
   literature (>20 studies) regarding the toxicity of pyrethroids in
   zebrafish, which is a valuable resource to those studying these
   pesticides. This study demonstrates that esfenvalerate at
   environmentally-relevant levels induces hypoactivity that are dependent
   upon the age of the zebrafish, and these behavioral changes are
   hypothesized to be related to impaired dopamine signaling. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Owing to the importance of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, many
   insecticides target the cholinergic system Across phyla, cholinergic
   signaling is essential for many neuro-developmental processes including
   axonal pathfinding and synaptogenesis. Consequently, early-life exposure
   to such insecticides can disturb these processes, resulting in an
   impaired nervous system. One test frequently used to assess
   developmental neurotoxicity is the zebrafish light-dark transition test,
   which measures larval locomotion as a response to light changes.
   However, it is only poorly understood which structural alterations cause
   insecticide-induced locomotion defects and how persistent these
   alterations are. Therefore, this study aimed to link locomotion defects
   with effects on neuromuscular structures, including motorneurons,
   synapses, and muscles, and to investigate the longevity of the effects.
   The cholinergic insecticides diazinon and dimethoate (organophosphates),
   methomyl and pirimicarb (carbamates), and imidacloprid and thiacloprid
   (neonicotinoids) were used to induce hypoactivity. Our analyses revealed
   that some insecticides did not alter any of the structures assessed,
   while others affected axon branching (methomyl, imidacloprid) or muscle
   integrity (methomyl, thiacloprid). The majority of effects, even
   structural, were reversible within 24 to 72 h. Overall, we find that
   both neurodevelopmental and non-neurodevelopmental effects of different
   longevity can account for the reduced locomotion. These findings provide
   unprecedented insights into the underpinnings of insecticide-induced
   hypoactivity.},

Abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides are a group of widely used bio-mimetic synthetic
   pesticides. However, recent studies reported that they could have an
   accumulation effect in human which may cause series of health problems.
   Estrogen receptors (ER) are a class of nuclear receptors that are vital
   in proper physiological behavior of estrogens. To investigate the
   reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids, homology modeling, molecular
   docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were conducted to explore
   the interaction between pyrethroids and ER alpha from atomic scale. The
   human ER alpha (2YJA) was selected as a template protein for homology
   modeling. Then eight typical pyrethroids and positive control estradiol
   were docked to the modeled protein. The highest scoring bifenthrin and
   the lowest scoring permethrin were chosen for in-depth analysis. MDs
   showed that the complex formed by permethrin with ER alpha had a lower
   RMSD value and binding free energies compared to bifenthrin. Based on
   these results from microscopic dimension, exposure experiments were
   implemented to validate the primary conclusions. VTG concentrations in
   male zebrafish's blood were significantly higher under permethrin
   exposure than bifenthrin, suggesting a stronger estrogenic activity and
   binding propensity. In this regard, the structural characteristics of
   molecules were analyzed, expecting to provide theoretical references for
   subsequent drug design and rational drug application.},

Abstract = {Cypermethrin is one of the top five pesticides used globally. Although
   the effect of cypermethrin on the embryonic stages of zebrafish is well
   characterized, its toxic effect on the behaviour of adult zebrafish is
   largely unknown. Here we used videogram and automated tracking approach
   to quantitatively assess behavioural toxicity induced by the short
   exposure of cypermethrin to adult zebrafish. We observed that
   cypermethrin at 25ppb level induced behavioural toxicity in adult
   zebrafish. Motor activity of the treated group was significantly
   retarded which affected their overall exploratory behaviour including
   their visit to the central arena of the open-field test. Furthermore,
   the treated group showed erratic movements (covered less distance per
   unit time) without affecting their angle based behavioural endpoints. In
   contrast to the control group, the cypermethrin exposed group showed
   frequent freezing behaviour. However, their freezing episodes were
   characterized by constant drift-like movement caused by the loss of
   their voluntary control over the motor coordination. These behavioural
   changes are similar to typical anxiety-like behaviour. Though,
   cypermethrin exposure at ppb level for just half an hour was sufficient
   to induce behavioural toxicity, it failed to alter brain superoxide
   dismutase and acetylcholine esterase enzyme activity. Our data indicates
   that acute short-term exposure of cypermethrin induces behavioural
   anomalies in adult zebrafish through a mechanism distinct from
   alteration of brain superoxide dismutase and the acetylcholine esterase
   activity.},

Journal = {PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that may selectively inhibit
   gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in insects. Although fipronil is the
   most widely used insecticide in aquatic environments, few studies have
   evaluated its neurotoxicity for the sensory and motor systems of aquatic
   vertebrates. We assessed the effects of acute fipronil exposure on the
   survival rate, number of hair cells of lateral lines, and neurotoxicity
   for zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, heat maps and the speed and
   distance of the swimming trajectory were compared between zebrafish
   subjected to the sham and fipronil treatments. Western blotting and
   immunohistochemistry were conducted separately to compare expressions of
   oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurotoxicity related
   proteins in the brain tissue between adult zebrafish with sham and
   fipronil treatments. Our results indicated that the survival rates and
   the speed and distance of the swimming trajectory significantly
   decreased for adult zebrafish exposed to fipronil. The results also
   suggested that the number of hair cells of lateral lines significantly
   reduced for zebrafish embryos exposed to fipronil. In histopathology and
   Western blotting tests, substantial oxidative stress, inflammation, and
   apoptosis were observed in the brain tissue of adult zebrafish exposed
   to fipronil. Our results revealed that fipronil toxicity may impair
   sensory and motor systems in zebrafish because of damage to lateral hair
   cells and brain tissue through oxidative stress, inflammation, and
   apoptosis, which in turn result in a significantly reduced survival rate
   and impaired locomotion. The behavioral responses of zebrafish exposed
   to fipronil toxicity should be determined for better understanding the
   reliability of behavioral biomarkers in the risk assessment of
   environmental toxicology.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the different behavioral responses of zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) under sudden stress from two types of chemicals (heavy
   metals and insecticides) and explored the correlations of behavioral
   responses and several well-known biomarkers. Adult zebrafish were
   exposed to cadmium (Cd) and deltamethrin for 5 hours. An increase in
   avoidance speed and turning frequency was first detected behavioral
   response. The duration of hyperactivity was almost 50 min in the
   deltamethrin exposure test and only 15 min in the Cd exposure test. A
   positive linear correlation was detected between variation in speed and
   brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in deltamethrin exposure
   (p<0.01, r(2)=0.7103), while no correlation was detected for Cd exposure
   (p>0.05, r(2)=0.0646). After 20 min exposure, zebrafish exposed to Cd
   stayed near the bottom but surfaced more frequently to deltamethrin.
   Swimming depth increased by 61.98\% from 139.92 mm to 226.24 mm in
   deltamethrin exposure, but decreased by 92.16\% from 161.26 mm to 83.92
   mm in Cd exposure. Our results suggest that those type-specific
   characters may attribute to the different mode of action of chemicals
   studied. The increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level and glutathione (GSH)
   concentration in tissues showed that toxicity was mainly in the gill
   following deltamethrin exposure but in the liver following Cd exposure.
   Speed and turning frequency under both exposures decreased
   significantly, even lower than the control group, which indicated a
   possible energy reallocation from locomotion to detoxification
   processes. Behavioral toxicity classifications provide another tool that
   may be used to help separate chemicals according to mode of action,
   which can contribute to the development of a biological early warning
   system for detecting toxicants at early stages of pollution.},

Abstract = {The insecticide fipronil, one of the main pesticides used in Brazil, is
   often detected in natural aquatic environments, and causes neuronal
   hyperexcitation by inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to
   putative alterations in behaviour and development. This work sought to
   analyse the toxicity of formulated Regent(R) 800WG (80\% fipronil) on
   development (fish embryo toxicity test, FET), morphology, and swimming
   behaviour of larvae and adults of zebrafish (Danio rerio). FET was
   performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging from
   0.002 to 1600 mu g.L-1 of formulated Regent(R) 800WG. Adults were
   exposed to 0.2, 2 and 20 mu g.L-1 of the product for 24 and 96 h, and
   were submitted to the light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance
   tests No lethal parameters were observed in larvae, but in
   concentrations above 400 mu g.L-1, there was shortening of the body axis
   and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure to the pesticide
   did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked
   decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental
   treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion,
   since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at
   all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural
   preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic
   effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor
   control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect
   activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may
   occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.},

Abstract = {Because of persistent organic pollution in aquatic environments, the
   widely used organochlorine pesticide endosulfan, which is a potential
   endocrine disruptor, is expected to pose a significant risk to aquatic
   organisms. In the present study, we explored the potential
   endocrine-disrupting risk of beta-endosulfan by investigating its effect
   on the growth, reproduction, plasma vitellogenin, and organ histology of
   adult zebrafish. We found that, although beta-endosulfan did not
   significantly affect the growth of zebrafish, it greatly decreased the
   hatching rate, even at a concentration as low as 10 ng/L. Interestingly,
   the decrease of the hatching rate was highly correlated with
   pathological alterations of the testes. Additionally, the values of the
   gonadosomatic index were significantly reduced in female zebrafish
   treated with 200 ng/L beta-endosulfan, which was also closely associated
   with ovarian histological changes. More importantly, a significant
   increase in the level of vitellogenin was observed in all male fish
   treated with beta-endosulfan. Based on these findings, we conclude that
   beta-endosulfan severely affects the reproductive function of zebrafish
   and the synthesis of vitellogenin in the liver, and thus,
   beta-endosulfan has a serious endocrine disruption function in
   zebrafish. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:2525-2531. (C) 2011 SETAC},

Abstract = {Tebuconazole is an effective chiral fungicide, and previous studies have
   demonstrated that tebuconazole enantiomers exhibit enantioselective
   toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms. Thus, the aim of the present
   study was to investigate the chiral bioaccumulation behavior of
   tebuconazole in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Two exposure concentrations
   (0.107 and 1.07 mg/L) of tebuconazole were used. The uptake experiments
   lasted for 8 days, and subsequently, the zebrafish were transferred to
   another clean tank containing water without tebuconazole for depuration
   experiments (up to 14 days). A significant trend in enantioselective
   bioaccumulation was observed in these zebrafish with the preferential
   accumulation of ( -)-R-tebuconazole at two dose levels. The results of
   the depuration experiments indicated that the degradation
   of)-R-tebuconazole in zebrafish was slower than that of
   (+)-S-tebuconazole. The BCFk values for (+)-S-tebuconazole and
   ()-R-tebuconazole in a low dose of this chemical were 11.22 and 16.25,
   respectively, while at a high dose, these values were 9.79 and 10.31,
   respectively. The enantiomer fraction of tebuconazole in zebrafish and
   water ranged from 031-0.49. Hence, future research should focus on the
   fate of tebuconazole in the aquatic environment at the enantiomer
   levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this study, the systemic assessments of the stereoisomers of triazole
   fungicide difenoconazole are reported for the first time, including
   absolute stereochemistry, stereoselective bioactivity toward pathogens
   (Alternaria sonali, Fulvia fulva, Botrytis cinerea, and Rhizoctonia
   solani), and toxicity toward aquatic organisms (Scenedesmus obliquus,
   Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio). Moreover, the stereoselective
   degradation of difenoconazole in vegetables (cucumber, Cucumis sativus
   and tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum) under field conditions and in soil
   under laboratory-controlled conditions (aerobic and anaerobic) was
   investigated. There were 1.33-24.2-fold and 1.04-6.78-fold differences
   in bioactivity and toxicity, respectively. Investigations on the
   stereoselective degradation of difenoconazole in vegetables showed that
   the highest-toxic and lowest-bioactive (2S,4S)-stereoisomer displays a
   different enrichment behavior in different plant species. Under aerobic
   or anaerobic conditions, (2R,4R)- and (2R,4S)-difenoconazole were
   preferentially degraded in the soil. Moreover, difenoconazole was
   configurationally stable in the test soil matrices. On the basis of
   biological activity, ecotoxicity, and environmental behavior, it is
   likely that the use of pure (2R,4S)-difenoconazole instead of the
   commercial stereoisomer mix may help to increase the bioactivity and
   reduce environmental pollution.},

Abstract = {The effects of chemicals on biotic interactions, such as competition and
   predation, have rarely been investigated in aquatic ecotoxicology. This
   study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey
   interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae
   (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic
   insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different
   treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4)
   both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual
   observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on
   exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP.
   Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid
   larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both
   predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of
   zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition
   of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no
   differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore
   propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier
   studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk
   assessment.},

Abstract = {Endosulfan is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide that is still
   widely in use in many developing countries. Following application,
   endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from
   agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including
   freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used
   biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results
   concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish,
   the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan
   in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed
   the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish
   swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of
   exposition, fish in the 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L group presented a
   significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 +/- 1.038 mu mol SCh h(-1)
   mg protein(-1): p = 0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87
   +/- 1.768 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p = 0.0205) which corresponds
   to approximately 40\%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not
   directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the
   RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a
   pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In
   addition, exposure to 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all
   exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (approximate
   to 21\%, 273.7 +/- 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the
   control group 344.6 +/- 21.30, p = 0.0483), traveled distance
   (approximate to 20\%, 23.44 +/- 2.127 m compared to the control group
   29.39 +/- 1.585, p = 0.0281), mean speed (approximate to 25\%, 0.03 +/-
   0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04 +/- 0.002, p = 0.0275) and
   body turn angle (approximate to 21\%, 69.940 +/- 4871 absolute turn
   angle compared to the control group 88.010 +/- 4560, p = 0.0114). These
   results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals'
   exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological
   and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same
   endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the
   inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence
   of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system.

Title = {The insecticide permethrin induces transgenerational behavioral changes
   linked to transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in zebrafish (Danio

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The pyrethroid insecticide permethrin is widely used for agricultural
   and domestic purposes. Previous data indicated that it acts as a
   developmental neurotoxicant and can induce transgenerational effects in
   non target organisms. However, associated underlying mechanisms remain
   unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate permethrin-related
   transgenerational effects in the zebrafish model, and to identify
   possible molecular mechanisms underlying inheritance. Zebrafish (F 0)
   were exposed to permethrin during early life (2 h post-fertilization up
   to 28 days). The F1 and F2 offspring generations were obtained by
   pairing exposed F0 males and females, and were bred unexposed. Locomotor
   and anxiety behavior were investigated, together with transcriptomic and
   epigenomic (DNA methylation) changes in brains. Permethrin exposed F0
   fish were hypoactive at adulthood, while males from the F1 and F2
   generations showed a specific decrease in anxiety-like behavior. In F0,
   transcriptomic data showed enrichment in pathways related to
   glutamatergic synapse activity, which may partly underlie the behavioral
   effects. In F1 and F2 males, dysregulation of similar pathways was
   observed, including a subset of differentially methylated regions that
   were inherited from the F0 to the F2 generation and indicated stable
   dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling. Altogether, the present
   results provide novel evidence on the transgenerational neurotoxic
   effects of permethrin, as well as mechanistic insight: a transient
   exposure induces persistent transcriptional and DNA methylation changes
   that may translate into transgenerational alteration of glutamatergic
   signaling and, thus, into behavioral alterations.

Abstract = {Fipronil, the phenylpyrazole insecticide, is effective and used in
   various fields. Especially, fipronil was reliable because it was known
   to be specific on invertebrate animals than vertebrate animals including
   mammals. However, fipronil had potential risks that affect vertebrate
   animals as it blocks the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors that
   also exists in vertebrates as well as invertebrates. Therefore, it was
   necessary that harmful effects of fipronil on vertebrates are clarified.
   For this purpose, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used on behalf of
   vertebrate animals in present study. The zebrafish were exposed to 5
   mu/L, 25 mu/L, and 50 mu/L of fipronil during 12, 24 and 72 hours. To
   closely observe toxic process, 12 hours and 24 hours of additional time
   point were set in the exposure test. Nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR)-based metabolomics is an approach to detect metabolic changes in
   organism resulted from external stimuli. In this study, NMR-based
   metabolomics showed the metabolic changes in zebrafish caused by
   fipronil exposure. Metabolic analysis revealed that fipronil interfered
   with energy metabolism and decreased the antioxidant ability in
   zebrafish. Antioxidant ability decline was remarkable at high exposure
   concentration. In addition, metabolic analysis results over time
   suggested that reactions for alleviating the excessive nerve excitation
   occurred in zebrafish after fipronil exposure. Through this study, it
   was elucidated that the adverse effects of fipronil on vertebrate
   animals are evident. The risk of fipronil on vertebrates can be no
   longer ignored. Moreover, this study has a meaning of practically
   necessary research for organism by examining the effects of fipronil at
   low concentrations existed in real environment.},

Abstract = {Deltamethrin is widely used because of its low toxicity and high
   efficiency. Although its potential toxicity has been reported, its
   effects on cardiovascular system and motor behavior and its underlying
   mechanisms have remained unclear. In this study, the effects of
   deltamethrin on the development, cardiovascular system and motor
   behavior of zebrafish larvae and their possible mechanisms were
   evaluated using the transgenic zebrafish Tg (kdrl:mCherry) and
   Tg(myl7:GFP). At 72 hpf, the body length of larvae shortened, the head
   and eye area decreased, and the hatching rate increased. Acridine orange
   staining showed that treated zebrafish larvae produced different degrees
   of apoptosis in the head, body, heart and tail regions. Quantitative
   fluorescence intensity showed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis
   signal, indicating that deltamethrin could induce apoptosis. Confocal
   images and fluorescence intensity quantification of red fluorescent
   protein-labeled vascular endothelial cell and green fluorescent
   protein-labeled transgenic zebrafish more clearly reflected the
   dose-dependent cardiac and vascular morphology and the damage caused by
   deltamethrin. Deltamethrin significantly induced vascular endothelial
   growth factor flk1 and fli-1, cardiac development-related gene myl7
   decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, deltamethrin
   increased the thigmotaxis of zebrafish larvae, causing anxiety-like
   behavior. Our study showed that deltamethrin could cause developmental
   toxicity, apoptosis, cardiovascular system damage and anxiety-like
   behavior, which provided a reference for the use of deltamethrin in
   agricultural production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Dysregulation of circadian rhythm in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by
   thifluzamide: Involvement of positive and negative regulators},

Volume = {235},
Pages = {280-287},

Abstract = {Thifluzamide as a fungicide is toxic to brain of zebrafish embryos.
   Brain can regulate biological rhythms. To clarify whether thifluzamide
   would influence circadian rhythms, zebrafish embryos were treated with
   thifluzamide (0, 0.19, 1.90 and 2.85 mg/L) for 4 days. Exposure to
   thifluzamide induced pronounced changes in embryo brain and melatonin
   levels. The mRNA levels of genes related to circadian rhythms were
   apparently altered. Among these, the transcripts of cry1ba and clock1
   were extremely correlated with exposure concentrations. Importantly, the
   content of cry1 showed no apparent changes, but the clock level was
   dramatically increased. Moreover, consistent with the inhibition of
   development and behavior, the levels of GH and DA were significantly
   inhibited. In addition, the expression levels of genes related to
   development, behavior and reproduction were significantly changed by
   thifluzamide. Therefore, we speculated that circadian disruption due to
   thifluzamide exposure were primarily attributed to increases in
   expression of clock1a and contents of clock, which might be at least in
   part responsible for abnormal development and behavior of zebrafish. In
   addition, our research will provide important insights into the grouped
   assessment of SDHI pesticides in future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In this study the effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA), a
   decomposition product of the herbicides propanil and diuron (and other
   pesticides), and diazinon, a neurotoxic insecticide, on early life
   stages of zebrafish Danio rerio were assessed. The toxicity of these
   substances with different modes of action (acetylcholine esterase
   inhibitor vs. polar narcosis) was tested for single substances as well
   as in binary mixtures. To study effects on different biological
   organisation levels (from the molecular up to the whole organism level)
   the molecular stress response regarding Hsp70, the embryonic and larval
   development and the locomotor activity were investigated as integrative
   biomarkers. In single substance tests 3,4-dichloroaniline elicited
   deformations at a parts per thousand yen0.25 mg/l during the 11 days
   subchronic test, whereas locomotor activity and mortality were impaired
   at a parts per thousand yen0.5 mg/l. Diazinon effects on those
   parameters were obvious at a parts per thousand yen2 mg/l, except for
   the deformation rate (11 days:1 mg/l). In equitoxic mixtures of both
   substances concentration additivity was observed for deformation rate
   and mortality (11 days). An increase in the Hsp70 content occurred in
   zebrafish exposed to 0.25 mg 3,4-DCA/l as well as to 0.05 mg diazinon/l;
   in mixtures concentration additivity could be shown. The investigated
   endpoints varied in respect to their sensitivity, with deformations and
   Hsp70 levels as most sensitive parameters concerning 3,4-DCA and Hsp70
   as most sensitive parameter concerning diazinon. Accordingly, for an
   integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals and their mixtures
   on fish, a battery of different test methods should be applied.},

Title = {Exposure of low-dose fipronil enantioselectively induced anxiety-like
   behavior associated with DNA methylation changes in embryonic and larval
   zebrafish},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {249},
Pages = {362-371},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fipronil, a broad-spectrum chiral insecticide, has been documented to
   induce significant neurotoxicity to nontarget aquatic species; however,
   whether its neurotoxicity behaves enantioselectively and what molecular
   mechanisms correspond to the neurotoxicity remain unanswered. To date,
   few investigations have focused on the genomic mechanisms responsible
   for the enantioselective toxicity of chiral pesticides. The epigenetic
   modifications, especially DNA methylation, caused by the pesticides are
   also blind spot of the research works. Video tracking showed that
   R-fipronil exhibited more intense neurotoxicity, as well as the
   induction of more severe anxiety-like behavior, such as boosted swimming
   speed and dysregulated photoperiodic locomotion, to embryonic and larval
   zebrafish compared with S-fipronil. The MeDIP-Seq analysis, combined
   with Gene Ontology and KEGG, revealed that R-fipronil disrupted five
   signaling pathways (MAPK, Calcium signaling, Neuroactive ligand-receptor
   interaction, Purine metabolism, and Endocytosis) to a greater extent
   than S-fipronil through the hypermethylation of several important
   neuro-related genes, whereas no significant alterations of global DNA
   methylation were observed on the two enantiomers. To summarize, our data
   indicated that the fipronil-conducted enantioselective neurotoxicity
   likely applied its enantioselectivity by the dysregulation of DNA
   methylation. Our study also provided novel epigenetic insights into the
   study of enantioselective biological effects and the relevant underlying
   mechanisms of chiral insecticide. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Organophosphates insecticides (OPs) are common surface water
   contaminants in both urban and agricultural landscapes. Neurobehavioral
   effects on larval fish are known to occur at concentrations higher than
   those reported in the environment. The aim of this study was to perform
   a comparative analysis of neurobehavioral, molecular, and biochemical
   responses of four OPs (diazinon, dichlorvos, malathion,
   methyl-parathion) via the following endpoint measurements: distance
   traveled, velocity, gene expression (AChE, c-Fos, LINGO-1B, GRIN-1B),
   enzymatic acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and carboxylesterase
   (CES) activity. OP exposures (5 hpf - 120 dpf) on embryo-larval
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) were assessed using a larval zebrafish behavior
   assay at concentrations: 0.01, 0.1, 10, and 100 mu g/L. Individual OPs
   had varying degrees of neurotoxicity. Significant hypoactivity was
   observed in the 100 mu g/L treatments for diazinon and malathion (p <
   0.05) as compared to the controls. Diazinon-exposed larvae exhibited a
   26\% locomotor decrease, and hypoactivity was observed in
   malathion-exposed larvae at a reduction of 22\% and 29\% for distance
   traveled and velocity, respectively. Gene regulation and enzymatic
   activity changes were measured for both 0.1 and 100 mu g/L exposures
   across OP treatments. Increased CES activity was observed for the 0.1 mu
   g/L treatments of diazinon and methyl-parathion as well as the 100 mu
   g/L treatment of dichlorvos; meanwhile, decreased CES activity was
   observed for 100 mu g/L treatments of diazinon and malathion. Relative
   enzymatic activity of AChE was inhibited as compared to the control for
   the 0.1 mu g/L diazinon. No other treatment group exhibited a
   significant effect on biochemical AChE activity; however, AChE
   upregulation was observed in the 0.1 mu g/L exposure for diazinon,
   dichlorvos, and malathion. Methyl-parathion was observed to downregulate
   c-Fos at 0.1 mu g/L exposure. Malathion upregulated LINGO-1B at 100 mu
   g/L, a gene associated with neuronal regeneration; meanwhile,
   downregulation of LINGO-1B was observed for 0.1 mu g/L exposure of
   methyl-parathion. Additional downregulation was observed for GRIN-1B in
   the 100 mu g/L diazinon, 100 mu g/L dichlorvos, and 0.1 mu g/L
   methyl-parathion treatments. Exposure of ZF embryos to independent
   concentrations of 100 mu g/L concentrations of diazinon and malathion
   resulted in hypoactivity and decreased CES activity at 5 dfp. No changes
   in swimming behavior were observed for either the 0.1 mu g/L or 100 mu
   g/L dichlorvos or methyl-parathion treatments. Observations from this
   study indicate that AChE inhibition may not be the most sensitive
   biomarker of OP pesticide exposure in zebrafish. Rather, the enzyme CES
   demonstrated higher sensitivity as a biomarker of OP toxicity.},

Abstract = {Increased application of the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin has
   adverse effects on the cardiac system and neurobehavior on the
   non-target organisms, which has raised the public's attention. Because
   of spermidine and melatonin considered to have cardioprotective and
   neuroprotective characteristics, zebrafish were utilized as the model
   organism to explore the protective effects of spermidine and melatonin
   against deltamethrin-induced toxicity. We tested the neurobehavior of
   zebrafish larvae through a rest/wake behavior assay, and evaluated the
   levels of the expression of Scn5lab, gata4, nkx2.5, hcrt, hcrtr, and
   aanat2 by qRT-PCR. Besides that cmlc2 was evaluated by whole-mount in
   situ hybridization. Results have shown that compared with control group,
   0.025 mg/L deltamethrin could significantly disturb the cardiac
   development, downregulating the expression of Scn5lab and
   transcriptional factors gata4 and nkx2.5, disturbing cardiac looping,
   resulting in defects in cardiac morphology and function. Moreover,
   deltamethrin could alter the expression levels of rest/wake genes and
   cause hyperactivity in zebrafish larvae. Besides, compared with
   deltamethrin group, the exogenous 0.01 mg/L spermidine and 0.232 mg/L
   melatonin could significantly rescue the adverse effects of deltamethrin
   on the cardiac system and neurobehavior in zebrafish. This indicated
   that spermidine and melatonin have neuroprotective and cardioprotective
   effects against deltamethrin-induced adverse effects in zebrafish.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) and pesticides are typical representatives of
   harmful chemicals in polluted waters. It is understood that the combined
   toxicity may differ from that of a single toxic substance. Although
   their combined toxicities on aquatic organisms have practical
   significance and research value, they have received little attention due
   to their complicated interaction, and the mechanism has rarely been
   reported. In this paper, we designed a study to investigate the single
   and combined effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) and the
   triazole fungicide difenoconazole on zebrafish, and to explore the
   mechanism of this effect. The results showed that PS-MPs could reduce
   the bioaccumulation of difenoconazole in zebrafish to a certain extent
   and alleviate the oxidative stress damage of difenoconazole in the
   zebrafish liver. The transcriptome and qRT-PCR data revealed the
   association of multiple pathways in the difenoconazole response, while
   the presence of PS-MPs ameliorated this effect in gene expression
   changes. Due to the properties of PS-MPs and the interaction between
   them, the toxic effect of difenoconazole when combined with PS-MPs is
   more prominent. These results provide a novel aspect to understand the
   environmental behavior of MPs and to evaluate the combined effect of MPs
   and pesticides on aquatic food. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The available arable land is unable to fulfill the food production need
   of rapidly the exponentially growing human population in the world.
   Pesticides are one of those different measures taken to meet this
   demand. As a plant growth regulator to block gibberellin, paclobutrazol
   (PBZ) is used excessively throughout the world to promote early fruit
   setting, and to increase seed setting which might be harmful because PBZ
   is a very stable compound; therefore, it can bioaccumulate into the food
   chain of an ecosystem. In the present study, we discovered unexpected
   effects of PBZ on zebrafish larvae and adult behaviors by challenging
   them with low dose exposure. Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days
   post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 mu g/L (0.01 ppm)
   and 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated
   at 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) and 1000 mu g/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ,
   respectively, for fourteen days. After incubation, the locomotor
   activity, burst, and rotation movement for the larvae; and multiple
   behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror biting,
   shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish
   were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and
   subjected to biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative
   stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels.
   Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with
   a high burst movement and swimming pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ
   resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior, while no significant
   results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and predator
   avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly
   compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish.
   Biochemical assays for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed significant reductions in their
   relative contents. In conclusion, for the first time, our behavior
   assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral alterations
   in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used
   plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more
   thorough tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.},

   interaction, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, dopamine and
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, and dopamine transporter

   injection of either 10mg/kg (Pq10) or 20mg/kg (Pq20) of Pq every 3 days
   for a total of six injections. Locomotion and distance traveled
   decreased at 24h after each injection in both treatment doses. In
   addition, both Pq10- and Pq20-treated animals exhibited differential

   evaluated, and no changes were observed in anxiety-related behaviors or
   social interactions in Pq-treated zebrafish. However, Pq-treated animals
   demonstrated impaired acquisition and consolidation of spatial memory in
   the Y-maze task. Interestingly, dopamine levels increased while DOPAC
   levels decreased in the zebrafish brain after both treatments. However,
   DAT expression decreased in the Pq10-treated group, and there was no
   change in the Pq20-treated group. The amount of TH protein showed no

Abstract = {Pesticides are widely used to eradicate insects, weed species, and fungi
   in agriculture. The half-lives of some pesticides are relatively long
   and may have the dire potential to induce adverse effects when released
   into the soil, terrestrial and aquatic systems. To assess the potential
   adverse effects of pesticide pollution in the aquatic environment,
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) andDaphnia magnaare two excellent animal models
   because of their transparent bodies, relatively short development
   processes, and well-established genetic information. Moreover, they are
   also suitable for performing high-throughput toxicity assays. In this
   study, we used both zebrafish larvae and water flea daphnia neonates as
   a model system to explore and compare the potential toxicity by
   monitoring locomotor activity. Tested animals were exposed to 12 various
   types of pesticides (three fungicides and 9 insecticides) for 24 h and
   their corresponding locomotor activities, in terms of distance traveled,
   burst movement, and rotation were quantified. By adapting principal
   component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis, we were
   able to minimize data complexity and compare pesticide toxicity based on
   locomotor activity for zebrafish and daphnia. Results showed distinct
   locomotor activity alteration patterns between zebrafish and daphnia
   towards pesticide exposure. The majority of pesticides tested in this
   study induced locomotor hypo-activity in daphnia neonates but triggered
   locomotor hyper-activity in zebrafish larvae. According to our PCA and
   clustering results, the toxicity for 12 pesticides was grouped into two
   major groups based on all locomotor activity endpoints collected from
   both zebrafish and daphnia. In conclusion, all pesticides resulted in
   swimming alterations in both animal models by either producing
   hypo-activity, hyperactivity, or other changes in swimming patterns. In
   addition, zebrafish and daphnia displayed distinct sensitivity and
   response against different pesticides, and the combinational analysis
   approach by using a phenomic approach to combine data collected from
   zebrafish and daphnia provided better resolution for toxicological
   assessment.},

Title = {Multi- and transgenerational effects following early-life exposure of

   behavior and lipid metabolism},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {205},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Transgenerational effects induced by environmental stressors are a
   threat to ecosystems and human health. However, there is still limited
   observation and understanding of the potential of chemicals to influence
   life outcomes over several generations. In the present study, we
   investigated the effects of two environmental contaminants, coumarin 47
   and permethrin, on exposed zebrafish (FO) and their progeny (F1-F3).
   Coumarin 47 is commonly found in personal care products and dyes,
   whereas permethrin is used as a domestic and agricultural pyrethroid
   insecticide/insect repellent. Zebrafish (F0) were exposed during early
   development until 28 days post-fertilization and their progeny (F1-F3)
   were bred unexposed. On one hand, the effects induced by coumarin 47
   suggest no multigenerational toxicity. On the other hand, we found that
   behavior of zebrafish larvae was significantly affected by exposure to
   permethrin in F1 to F3 generations with some differences depending on
   the concentration. This suggests persistent alteration of the neural or
   neuromuscular function. In addition, lipidomic analyses showed that
   permethrin treatment was partially correlated with
   lysophosphatidylcholine levels in zebrafish, an important lipid for
   neurodevelopment. Overall, these results stress out one of the most
   widely used pyrethroids can trigger long-term, multi- and possibly
   transgenerational changes in the nervous system of zebrafish. These

Title = {Avoidance response of Danio rerio to a fungicide in a linear
   contamination gradient},

Abstract = {The present study examines the ability of juvenile Danio rerio to avoid
   pyrimethanil-contaminated water. An avoidance assay system was used with
   a contamination gradient formed by seven compartments, through which the
   fish could move and choose the preferred compartment(s). Additionally,
   the influence of fish movements in promoting the mixing between
   compartments and thus disruption of the gradient over time was also
   examined by testing sodium chloride (NaCl) at sublethal concentrations.
   Samples with pyrimethanil were obtained from the commercial formulation
   Mythos (R), which was applied to mesocosm systems. Samples of the
   pyrimethanil-contaminated mesocosms water were collected and a series of
   seven concentrations (0.2 to 1.4 mg L-1 plus a control) diluted with
   reference (uncontaminated) mesocosm water were added to the system to
   form the gradient. After 4 h exposure, fish avoidance in the three
   highest pyrimethanil concentrations ranged from 29 to 66\%. The 4
   h-AC(50) (concentration at which 50\% of the fish avoided pyrimethanil
   after 4 h exposure) was 1.10 (confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.12) mg L-1.
   However, the avoidance pattern after 12 h was strongly reduced and it
   was not possible to calculate the AC(50). This is explained by the
   results of the NaCl experiment, which showed that the movement of fish
   in the system accelerates the mixing of the solutions between
   compartments. As pyrimethanil can trigger avoidance response in D.
   rerio, this fungicide, even at non-lethal concentrations, could be
   considered an environmental disturber. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Due to human activities, there is an increasing presence of

   show that fish acutely exposed to glyphosate, 2,4-D, and
   methylbenzoate-based agrichemicals have their anti-predatory responses
   impaired. We exposed zebrafish to sub-lethal concentrations of
   agrichemicals and evaluated their behavioral reaction against a
   simulated bird predatory strike. We observed that agrichemical-exposed
   fish spent more time in a risky area, suggesting that the pesticides
   interfered with their ability of risk perception. Our results highlight
   the impairment and environmental consequences of agrochemical residues,
   which can affect aquatic life and crucial elements for life (food web)
   such as the prey-predator relationship.},

Abstract = {Background: Changes in fish behavior can help identify accidental
   chemical pollution. Heavy metals and pesticides are two of the most
   found pollutants to investigate the different behavioral responses of
   fish to these two types of pollutants exposure. Methods
   : Real-time computer imaging was utilized to record parameters of fish
   behaviors, including swimming speed, turning frequency, depth and
   distance between fish. Deltamethrin and cadmium were 0.015 ppm and 3.5
   ppm, respectively. It was conducted for a total period of 180 min. Fish
   behaviors were recorded with dechlorinated water during the first 60
   mins, then deltamethrin and cadmium was introduced to observe behavioral
   responses of zebrafish during the next 120 mins.
   Result: As a result of increased swimming activity, the first response
   of zebrafish is avoidance followed by a changed distribution in the test
   chamber. The duration of hyperactivity during deltamethrin exposure was
   lasted 35 minutes larger than Cd exposure and the average swimming depth
   showed totally different trends with increased from 140 mm to 226 mm
   during deltamethrin exposure but decreased from 161 to 84 mm during
   cadmium exposure. It is proved that these different responses do exist
   under in the two chemicals studied and this may contribute to the
   development of biological early warning system to separate accidental
   chemical pollution types.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is an active substance of many
   herbicides. According to literature studies, glyphosate residues and

   toxicological reports confirmed negative effects on living organisms. In
   this study, the acute embryo toxicity of glyphosate into two different

   addition, other sublethal endpoints such as hatching rate, formation of
   somites, and development of eyes, spontaneous movement, heartbeat/blood
   circulation, pigmentation, and edema were recorded to indicate the mode
   of action of the toxic compound. Hatching retardation (p < 0.05) was
   observed in experimental groups of common carp exposed to glyphosate
   with significant statistical difference especially at the highest
   concentration after 72, 96, and 120 hpf. The significantly highest
   cumulative mortality at concentration of 50 mg/l was observed. In
   contrast, hatching stimulation was observed in embryos of zebrafish
   exposed to the highest concentration of glyphosate. The significantly
   highest cumulative mortality for zebrafish was observed only at

Title = {Screening anti-predator behaviour in fish larvae exposed to
   environmental pollutants},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {714},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Predation is one of the main sources of mortality for fish larvae.
   During evolution, they have developed different anti-predator
   behaviours, as the vibrational-evoked startle response and its
   habituation, for promoting survival to predator's strikes. Whereas these
   two behaviours can be altered by the exposure to some neurotoxicants, it
   is currently unknown if the exposure to environmentally relevant
   concentration (ERC) of neurotoxic pollutants could impair them. In this
   study thirty neurotoxic environmental pollutants from nine chemical
   groups, including: herbicides: carbamate, organophosphate (OP),
   organochlorine (OC), neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides; toxins;
   metal and non-metal elements, have been screened at two concentrations,
   including one environmental relevant concentration (ERC), for adverse
   effects on anti-predator behaviours by using the Vibrational Startle
   Response Assay on zebrafish larvae. Significant effects over
   anti-predator responses were equally observed in both exposure
   concentrations. Focusing on the ERC scenario, it was found that the
   startle response was the less affected behaviour, where ten pollutants
   from all chemical groups except for organochlorine, neonicotinoid and
   pyrethroids, altered this response. Interestingly, organic and inorganic
   pollutants showed opposite effects on this response: whereas all organic
   pollutants decreased the startle response, the three remaining inorganic
   pollutants increased it. On the other hand, more pollutants affected
   habituation of the startle response of the larvae, where thirteen of the
   pollutants from all groups, except for herbicides, altered this
   behaviour at ERC, generally resulting in a faster habituation except for
   one OP and one marine toxin, which were able to delay this response.
   Ultimately, only one chemical from the OP, toxin, metal and non-metal
   element groups altered both the startle response and its habituation at
   both ERC and WSC. These results emphasize the environmental risk of the
   current levels of some neurotoxicants present in our aquatic ecosystems,
   as they are high enough to impair essential anti-predator behaviours in
   fish larvae. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {228},
Pages = {649-655},

Abstract = {Circadian rhythms are fundamental to behavior and physiology of
   organisms. Flutolanil as a fungicide is toxic to zebrafish embryos. The
   aims of this study were to determine whether fiutolanil would influence
   circadian rhythms of zebrafish and the mechanism involved. Zebrafish
   embryos were exposed to flutolanil (0, 0.125, 0.5 and 2 mg/L) for 4
   days. Here we report that flutolanil increased the melatonin levels of
   zebrafish. The mRNA levels of genes related to circadian rhythms were
   significantly altered. The clock level was significantly increased, but
   the content of cry1 showed no apparent changes. Moreover, our findings
   that the level of GH was significantly decreased were consistent with
   the abnormal development of zebrafish embryos. The expression levels of
   genes related to development, behavior and reproduction were
   significantly altered by flutolanil. These results indicate that
   flutolanil disturbed circadian rhythms of zebrafish primarily by
   affecting the positive elements, which were at least in partial
   responsible for abnormal development and behavior of zebrafish. And we
   speculate that flutolanil is toxic to zebrafish embryos at least in part
   via dysregulation of circadian rhythms involving clock. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to concentrations of

   either 4-6 h postfertilization or 4-6 h posthatch to determine effects
   on hatching time, growth, mobility, foraging ability, and reproduction.
   Eggs exposed to endosulfan took longer to hatch, and the resulting fry
   were smaller at 1 week of age and had decreased mobility at 2 weeks of
   age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced
   fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka
   exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early
   mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual
   maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed
   females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka
   exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L)
   exhibiting the greatest response. These results suggest that short-term

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Volume = {193},
Pages = {24-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Information on how atrazine can affect the spatial distribution of
   organisms is non-existent. As this effect has been observed for some
   other contaminants, we hypothesized that atrazine-containing
   leachates/discharges could trigger spatial avoidance by the fish
   Poecilia reticulata and form a chemical barrier isolating upstream and
   downstream populations. Firstly, guppies were exposed to an atrazine
   gradient in a non-forced exposure system, in which organisms moved
   freely among the concentrations, to assess their ability to avoid
   atrazine. Secondly, a chemical barrier formed by atrazine, separating
   two clean habitats (extremities of the non-forced system), was simulated
   to assess whether the presence of the contaminant could prevent guppies
   from migrating to the other side of the system. Fish were able to avoid
   atrazine contamination at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.02
   mu g L-1), below those described to cause sub-lethal effects. The AC(50)
   (atrazine concentration causing avoidance to 50\% of the population) was
   0.065 mu g L-1. The chemical barrier formed by atrazine at 150 mu g L-1
   (concentration that should produce an avoidance around 82\%) caused a
   reduction in the migratory potential of the fish by 47\%; while the
   chemical barrier at 1058 mu g L-1 (concentration that produces
   torpidity) caused a reduction in the migratory potential of the fish by
   91\%. Contamination by atrazine, besides driving the spatial
   distribution of fish populations, has potential to act as a chemical
   barrier by isolating fish populations. This study includes a novel
   approach to be integrated in environmental risk assessment schemes to
   assess high-tier contamination effects such as habitat fragmentation and
   population displacement and isolation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Zebrafish are increasingly used for developmental neurotoxicity testing
   because early embryonic events are easy to visualize, exposures are done
   without affecting the mother and the rapid development of zebrafish
   allows for high throughput testing. We used zebrafish to examine how
   exposures to three different organophosphorus pesticides (chlorpyrifos,
   diazinon and parathion) over the first five days of embryonic and larval
   development of zebrafish affected their survival, acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) activity and behavior. We show that at non-lethal, equimolar
   concentrations, chlorpyrifos (CPF) is more effective at equimolar
   concentrations than diazinon (DZN) and parathion (PA) in producing AChE
   inhibition. As concentrations of DZN and PA are raised, lethality occurs
   before they can produce the degree of AChE inhibition observed with CPF
   at 300 nM. Because of its availability outside the mother at the time of
   fertilization, zebrafish provides a complementary model for studying the
   neurotoxicity of very early developmental exposures. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Bifenthrin (BF) is widely used as a miticide in orchards, nurseries and
   homes due to its great photostability and insecticidal activity.
   Recently, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in
   in vitro and in vivo assays. However, no data is so far available
   regarding the developmental toxicity of BF to fish in early life stages.
   In this study, the developmental effects of BF were evaluated in
   embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf),
   spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal
   malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No
   significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the
   control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for
   96 h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a
   concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous
   movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test
   compound with 96-h EC50 of 256 mu g L-1 for pericardial edema, and 109
   mu g L-1 for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that
   zebrafish larvae of 96 hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after
   exposure to 50, 100, and 200 mu g L-1 from 3 to 84 hpf. After being
   cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120 hpf,
   larvae from the 50 mu g L-1 group seemed to have recovered and showed no
   difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while
   animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam
   in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription
   real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were
   significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150 mu g L-1 BF for
   72 h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our
   studies showed that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early
   life stage after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had
   the ability to impair the individual behaviours which are of great
   importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Permethrin (PM) is one of the most used synthetic pyrethroid worldwide.
   Exposure to this compound during pregnancy and early childhood has been
   indicated as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. We
   evaluated the long-term effects of embryonic PM exposure in different
   stages of zebrafish development. Briefly, embryos (3 hpf) were exposed
   to sub-lethal concentrations of PM (25 and 50 mu g.L-1) during 24 h and
   then behavioral parameters were evaluated during embryonic (28 hpf),
   eleutheroembryonic (3 dpf), larval (7 dpf), and adult stages (90 dpf).
   PM exposure decreased spontaneous movement at 28 hpf and decreased
   thigmotaxis in eleutheroembryos. The long-term effects of PM include
   changes in non-motor behaviors such as fear and anxiety in larva and
   adults. Adults embryonically exposed to PM also showed a significant
   increase in aggressiveness parameters. These results demonstrated that
   embryonic exposure to PM induces persistent neurotoxic effects in
   adulthood, which can impair the cognitive and behavioral fitness of
   non-target species contributing to a rise in neurodevelopmental
   disorders.},

Abstract = {Pyrethroid and organophosphate pesticides are two of the most commonly
   used classes of insecticide worldwide. At sublethal concentrations,
   permethrin (a pyrethroid) and chlorpyrifos (an organophosphate) impact
   behavior in model fish species. We investigated behavioral effects of
   environmentally relevant concentrations of permethrin or chlorpyrifos on
   early larval delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a Critically
   Endangered teleost species endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta,
   California, USA. Using a photomotor behavioral assay of oscillating
   light and dark periods, we measured distance moved, turn angle, meander,
   angular velocity, rotations, thigmotaxis (time spent in the border
   versus center), and swim speed duration and frequency. The lowest
   concentrations of permethrin used in the tests (0.05 and 0.5 mu g l(-1))
   caused significant increases in distance moved at 72 and 96 h,
   respectively. At 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure, 5 mu g l(-1) of
   permethrin caused a hyperactive state in which the larvae significantly
   decreased thigmotaxis, quickly turning in short bouts of activity,
   characterized by significant increases in rotations and freezing events.
   Larvae exposed to 0.05 mu g l(-1) chlorpyrifos significantly increased
   thigmotaxis at 72 and 96 h. In response to 5 mu g l(-1) chlorpyrifos,
   larvae significantly increased velocity at 72 h exposure, and
   significantly increased freezing events at 96 h. Behavioral data on
   larval delta smelt exposed to contaminants present in their limited
   habitat have the potential to aid evaluations of the suitability of
   spawning and rearing habitats for this endangered species, thus
   improving conservation management strategies focused on this sensitive
   life stage.},

   based on locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Cyanide, organophosphate and rodenticides are highly toxic substances
   widely used in agriculture and industry. These toxicants are neuro-and
   organotoxic to mammals at low concentrations, thus early detection of
   these chemicals in the aqueous environment is of utmost importance.
   Here, we employed the behavioral toxicity test with wildtype zebrafish
   larvae to determine sublethal concentrations of the above mentioned
   common environmental pollutants. After optimizing the test with cyanide,
   nine rodenticides and an organophosphate were successfully tested. The
   compounds dose-dependently initially (0-60-min exposure) stimulated
   locomotor activity of larvae but induced toxicity and reduced swimming
   during 60-120-min exposure. IC50 values calculated based on swimming
   distance after 2-h exposure, were between 0.1 and 10 mg/L for both
   first-generation and second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. Three
   behavioral characteristics, including total distance travelled,
   sinuosity and burst count, were quantitatively analyzed and compared by
   hierarchical clustering of the effects measured by each three
   parameters. The toxicity results for all three behavioral endpoints were
   consistent, suggesting that the directly measured parameter of
   cumulative swimming distance could be used as a promising biomarker for
   the aquatic contamination. The optimized method herein showed the
   potential for utilization as part of a monitoring system and an ideal
   tool for the risk assessment of drinking water in the military and
   public safety.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Deltamethrin, a widely used type II pyrethroid insecticide, was reported
   with neurotoxicity to aquatic organisms, such as fish. However, the
   effects and potential mechanisms on the central nervous system remain
   largely unknown, especially under environmental concentrations.
   Therefore, we exposed adult female zebrafish to environmentally relevant
   levels of deltamethrin (30,100, and 333 ng/L) for 21 days to assess
   neurobehavioral changes related to the central nervous system and
   explore the modes of action. Behavioral assays revealed significant
   increases in the swimming speeds, residence time near other fish and the
   shoaling cohesion in exposed fish. Transcriptomic results enriched the
   disrupted neural functions involving the glutamatergic and dopaminergic
   synapses in the brain. The qRT-PCR confirmed the up regulation of the
   factors for promoting the glutamate release. The measurement of
   neurotransmitters showed significantly increased content of the
   excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. Taken together,
   deltamethrin exposure increased the glutamate level and promoted the
   release of such an excitatory neurotransmitter between the glutamatergic
   synapses in the brain, which eventually led to hyperactivity of social
   behaviors in adult zebrafish.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate {[}N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] is one of the most popular
   herbicides worldwide. Globally, the use of glyphosate is increasing, and
   its residues have been found in drinking water and food products. The
   data regarding the possible toxic effects of this herbicide are

   (Danio rerio) embryos. Embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 100, and 1,000 mu
   g/L glyphosate for 96 h, and mortality, heart rate, and hatching rate
   were evaluated. After the experiment, RNA was extracted from the embryos
   for transcriptional analysis. No mortality was recorded, and exposure to
   100 mu g/L and 1,000 mu g/L of glyphosate resulted in lower heart rates
   at 48 h. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that glyphosate exposure
   induced subtle changes in gene transcription profiles. We found 30
   differentially expressed genes; however, the highest glyphosate
   concentration (1,000 mu g/L) induced the greatest number of
   differentially expressed genes involved in oocyte maturation, metabolic

Abstract = {Chronic exposure to synthetic insecticides in the early life of a child
   can lead to a series of disorders. Several causes as parental age,
   maternal smoking, birth complications, and exposure to toxins such as
   insecticides on childhood can lead to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

   protective role of vitamin C (Vit. C) from children's supplements after
   14 days chronic exposure to insecticide mixture fipronil (Fip) +
   pyriproxyfen (Pyr) on juvenile zebrafish for swimming performances,
   social behavior and oxidative stress associated with ASD model. Juvenile
   (14-17 mm) wild-type AB zebrafish (Danio rerio) (45 days) were exposed
   to relevant concentrations: vit. C (25 mu g L-1), Fip (600 mu g

   Our results showed that insecticides can disturb the social behavior of
   zebrafish during 14 days of the administration, decreased the swimming
   performances, and elevated the oxidative stress biomarkers of SOD
   (superoxide dismutase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and MDA
   (malondialdehyde). The vitamin C supplement significantly attenuated the
   neurotoxicity of insecticide mixture and oxidative stress. This study
   provides possible in vivo evidence to show that vitamin C supplements
   could attenuate oxidative stress and brain damage of fipronil and
   pyriproxyfen insecticide chronic exposure on zebrafish juvenile.},

Abstract = {Organophosphates (OPs) and pyrethroids (PYRs) are extensively used
   pesticides and often occur in the form of mixture, whereas little was

   and joint effects of OPs and PYRs exposure on zebrafish embryo by
   employing chlorpyrifos (CPF) and deltamethrin (DM) as representatives.
   Zebrafish embryos at 2 hours post fertilization (hpf) were exposed to
   CPF (4.80, 39.06, and 78.13 mu g/L), DM exposure (0.06, 1.60, and 3.19

   metabolomic changes were recorded and examined. Results displayed that
   individual exposure to CPF and DM significantly increased the mortality
   and malformation rate of zebrafish embryos, but decreased hatching rate
   was only found in CPF + DM co-exposure groups (p < .05). Meanwhile,
   individual CPF exposure had no detrimental effect on locomotor activity,
   high dose of individual CPF exposure decreased the swimming speed but
   had adaptability to the conversion from dark to light, whereas high dose
   of CPF + DM co-exposure exhibited not only significant decline in
   swimming speed but also no adaptability to the repeated stimulations,
   suggesting deficit in learning and memory function. In metabolomic
   analysis, individual CPF exposure mainly influenced the metabolism of
   glycerophospholipids and amino acids, individual DM exposure mainly
   influenced glycerophospholipids, and CPF + DM co-exposure mainly
   influenced glycerophospholipids and amino acids. Taken together, our
   findings suggested the embryonic toxicities and neurobehavioral changes
   caused by CPF and/or DM exposure. The disorder metabolomics of
   glycerophospholipids and amino acids might be involved in the underlying
   mechanism of those toxicities.},

Abstract = {Neurobehavioral disorders such as anxiety, autism, and attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorders are typically influenced by genetic and
   environmental factors. Although several genetic risk factors have been
   identified in recent years, little is known about the environmental
   factors that either cause neurobehavioral disorders or contribute to
   their progression in genetically predisposed individuals. One
   environmental factor that has raised concerns is chlorpyrifos, an
   organophosphate pesticide that is widely used in agriculture and is
   found ubiquitously in the environment. In the present study, we examined
   the effects of sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure on anxiety-related
   behavior during development using zebrafish larvae. We found that
   sub-chronic exposure to 0.01 or 0.1 mu M chlorpyrifos during development
   induces specific behavioral defects in 7-day-old zebrafish larvae. The
   larvae displayed decreases in swim speed and thigmotaxis, yet no changes
   in avoidance behavior were seen. Exposure to 0.001 mu M chlorpyrifos did
   not affect swimming, thigmotaxis, or avoidance behavior and exposure to
   1 mu M chlorpyrifos induced behavioral defects, but also induced defects
   in larval morphology. Since thigmotaxis, a preference for the edge, is
   an anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae, we propose that
   sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure interferes with the development of
   anxiety-related behaviors. The results of this study provide a good
   starting point for examination of the molecular, cellular,
   developmental, and neural mechanisms that are affected by
   environmentally relevant concentrations of organophosphate pesticides. A
   more detailed understanding of these mechanisms is important for the
   development of predictive models and refined health policies to prevent
   toxicant-induced neurobehavioral disorders. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {As aquatic environments associated with conventional agriculture are
   exposed to various pesticides, it is important to identify any possible
   interactions that modify their effects when in a mixture. We applied
   avoidance tests with Danio rerio, exposing juveniles to three relevant
   current use pesticides: chlorpyrifos (CPF), chlorothalonil (CTL) and
   glyphosate (Gly), individually and in binary mixtures (CPF-Gly and
   CTL-Gly). Our goal was to identify the potential of contaminants to
   trigger the avoidance response in fish and detect any changes to that
   response resulting from binary mixtures. Avoidance was assessed for
   three hours using an open gradient system with six levels of increasing
   concentrations. Fish avoided environmentally relevant concentrations of
   the three compounds. The avoidance of CPF {[}AC50 = 7.95 (3.3-36.3) mu
   g/L] and CTL {[}AC50 = 3.41 (1.2-41.6) mu g/L] was evident during the
   entire period of observation. In the case of Gly, the response changed
   throughout the experiment: initially (until 100 min) the fish tolerated
   higher concentrations of the herbicide {[}AC50 = 52.2 (12.1-2700) mu
   g/L] while during the later period (after 100 min) a clearer avoidance
   {[}1.5 (0.8-4.2) mu g/L] was observed. The avoidance recorded using CPF
   and CTL alone was attenuated by the presence of Gly. Applying an
   additive concentration model, Gly initially acted synergistically with
   the other two compounds, although this interaction was not observed
   during the later period. Avoidance gives us an idea of how the
   distribution of populations may be altered by contamination, our results
   suggest that in some mixtures this response may be inhibited, at least
   temporarily, thus masking the ecological risk of the exposure.},

Abstract = {Rotenone, a natural compound derived from plants of the genera Derris
   and Lonchocarpus, is used worldwide as a pesticide and piscicide. This
   study aims to assess short-term toxicity of rotenone to early-life
   stages of the fish Danio rerio and Poecilia reticulata using a wide and
   integrative range of biomarkers (developmental, biochemical, behavioral,
   and histopathological). Moreover, the species sensitivity distribution
   (SSD) approach was used to compare rotenone acute toxicity to fish
   species. Toxicity tests were based on the OECD protocols, fish embryo
   toxicity test (for D. rerio embryos), and fish acute toxicity test (for
   P. reticulata juveniles). D. rerio embryos were used to estimate lethal
   concentrations and analyze embryonic and enzymatic alterations (activity
   of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cholinesterase), while P.
   reticulata juveniles were used for the assessment of histological damage
   in the gills and liver. Rotenone induced significant mortality in
   zebrafish embryos with a 96-h lethal concentration 50 \% (LC50) = 12.2

   embryos, which showed cardiac edema; tail deformities; loss of
   equilibrium; and a general delay characterized by lack of tail
   detachment, delayed somite formation, yolk sac absorption, and lack of
   pigmentation. Biochemical biomarker inhibition was observed for
   concentrations >= 1 mu g/L for CAT and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
   and for cholinesterase (ChE) in concentration from 10 mu g/L. Behavioral
   changes were observed for P. reticulata juveniles exposed to
   concentrations equal to or above 25 mu g/L of rotenone; moreover,
   histological damage in the liver and gills of fish exposed to
   concentrations equal to or above 2.5 mu g/L could be observed. A hazard
   concentration 5 \% (HC5) of 3.2 mu g/L was estimated considering the
   acute toxicity data for different fish species (n = 49). Lethal and
   sublethal effects of rotenone raise a concern about its effects on
   nontarget fish species, especially because rotenone and its metabolite
   rotenolone are frequently reported in the microgram range in natural
   environments for several days after field applications. Rotenone should
   be used with caution. Given the high toxicity and wide range of
   sublethal effects here reported, further studies in a chronic exposure
   scenario are recommended.},

Abstract = {Bifenthrin (BF) is a synthetic pyrethroid that targets the nervous
   system of insects and may have adverse effects on the behavior and
   development of nontarget organisms. However, no reports have been issued
   on the effects of different enantiomers on locomotor behavior for
   synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) in zebrafish, and whether locomotor activity
   is associated with the developmental toxicities remains unclear. In this
   study, enantioselectivity of BF (1S and 1R) on the acute locomotor
   activity and developmental toxicities of embryonic larval zebrafish were
   first evaluated. The results indicated that 1R-BF was more toxic,
   causing morphological impairments, with a 96-h median effective
   concentration (EC50) of 226 mu g/L for pericardial edema and 145 mu g/L
   for curved body axis. Administration of 201 mu g/L of one enantiomer of
   BF had differential effects on the locomotor activity of zebrafish
   larvae at 4 d postfertilization (dpf) under alternating light and dark
   conditions. Larvae treated with 1R-BF were not sensitive to the
   alteration of light to dark, and the locomotor activities were reduced
   to a level similar to that observed in light, which otherwise increased
   rapidly and markedly. However, 1S-BF did not alter the general pattern
   of zebrafish response to the light or dark compared with the control.
   The results demonstrated that the differential effects on development
   might have contributed to the enantioselectivity in the locomotor
   activity. The consistency of enantioselectivity with insecticidal
   activity may also indicate a common mode of action. Furthermore, 1R-BF
   accelerated the spontaneous movement and hatching process, whereas 1S-BF
   seemed to be inhibitory. The results suggest the need to link behavioral
   changes to developmental toxicities in order to achieve more
   comprehensive health risk assessments of chiral pesticides. Environ.

Abstract = {Imidacloprid (IMI) is an insecticide used worldwide, a neonicotinoid
   that could cause toxicity in non-target organisms. Zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) is a model organism widely used in different fields of research
   such as behavioral studies, biochemical parameters as well as
   neurotoxicity research. Here, we investigate whether the exposure to
   three concentrations (0.15, 15, and 45 mu g/L) of IMI for 96 h alters
   responses in zebrafish. Oxidative stress parameters and
   acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) as well as the behavioral responses
   of locomotion were measured. IMI exposure decreased distance traveled in
   fish exposed to the 45 mu g/L. In the exploratory activity, time spent
   and transitions to the top area of the water column decreased in fish
   exposed to all concentrations of IMI. In addition, exposures to 45 and
   15 mu g/L of IMI decreased episodes of erratic movement in the
   zebrafish. Exposures to IMI at a concentration of 45 mu g/L decreased
   the time spent in erratic movements and increased the time spent with no
   movement (i.e., ``freezing{''}). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
   activity was increased in the brain of zebrafish exposed for 96 h to
   concentrations of 0.15 and 45 mu g/L. Brain AChE activity was reduced
   and the levels of carbonyl protein (CP) increased in brain of zebrafish
   at concentrations of 15 and 45 mu g/L. Lipid peroxidation measured by
   TBARS and, also non-protein thiols (NPSH) did not show any variation in
   the brain of zebrafish exposed to IMI. Changes in the activity of
   cholinergic neurotransmitters in the brain tissues of zebrafish indicate
   IMI toxicity. Exposures of fish over 96 h to IMI at a nominal
   concentration of 45 mu g/L caused more extensive sublethal responses in
   zebrafish, but this concentration is well above those expected in the
   aquatic environment. Studies are warranted to evaluate the effects on
   behavior and biomarker responses in fish exposed over longer periods to
   IMI at environmentally relevant concentrations.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Glyphosate {[}N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] is the active ingredient in
   widely used broad-spectrum herbicides. Even though the toxicity
   mechanism of this herbicide in vertebrates is poorly understood,
   evidence suggests that glyphosate is an endocrine disruptor capable of
   producing morphological anomalies as well as cardiotoxic and neurotoxic
   effects. We used the zebrafish model to assess the effects of early life
   glyphosate exposure on the development of cartilage and bone tissues and
   organismal responses. We found functional alterations, including a
   reduction in the cardiac rate, significant changes in the spontaneous
   tail movement pattern, and defects in craniofacial development. These
   effects were concomitant with alterations in the level of the estrogen
   receptor alpha osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. We also found that
   embryos exposed to glyphosate presented spine deformities as adults.
   These developmental alterations are likely induced by changes in protein
   levels related to bone and cartilage formation.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of 1,2,4-triazole fungicide toxicity in zebrafish
   (Danio rerio): A mitochondrial and metabolic perspective},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {809},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {In this critical review, we synthesize data from peer-reviewed
   literature reporting on triazole fungicide exposures in the zebrafish
   model. Based on their mode of action in plants (potent inhibitors of
   ergosterol synthesis), we focused attention on mechanisms related to
   cellular, lipid, and steroid metabolism. Evidence from several studies
   reveals that zebrafish exposed to triazoles present with impaired
   mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress, as well as
   dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Suchmetabolic disruptions are
   expected to underscore developmental delays, deformity, and aberrant
   locomotor activity and behaviors often observed following exposure. We
   begin by summarizing physiological and behavioral effects observed with
   triazole fungicide exposure in zebrafish. We then discuss mechanisms
   that may underlie adverse apical effects, focusing on mitochondrial
   bioenergetics and metabolism. Using computational approaches, we also
   identify novel biomarkers of triazole fungicide exposure. Extracting and
   analyzing data contained in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database
   (CTD) revealed that transcriptional signatures responsive to different
   triazoles are related to metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins,
   biological oxidations, and fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body
   metabolism among other processes. Pathway and sub-network analysis
   identified several transcripts that are responsive in organisms exposed
   to triazole fungicides, several of which include lipid-related genes.
   Knowledge gaps and recommendations for future investigations include;
   (1) targeted metabolomics for metabolites in glycolysis, Krebs cycle,
   and the electron transport chain; (2) additional studies conducted at
   environmentally relevant concentrations to characterize the potential
   for endocrine disruption, given that studies point to altered
   cholesterol (precursor for steroid hormones), as well as altered
   estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid hormone expression; (3) studies into
   the potential role for lipid peroxidation and oxidation of lipid
   biomolecules as a mechanism of triazole-induced toxicity, given the
   strong evidence for oxidative damage in zebrafish following exposure to
   triazole fungicides. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   failure and inhibited neurogenesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {385},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Fipronil has been widely used in agriculture to prevent aggressive
   insects from damaging agricultural products. Fipronil residues circulate
   in the environment and they have been detected in non-targeted organisms
   in aquatic environments. To study the effect of fipronil toxicity on
   environmental health, 6 h post fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos
   were treated with fipronil for 72 h. LC50 value was obtained by applying
   varying concentrations of fipronil to zebrafish embryos for 72 h. As
   zebrafish embryos are useful vertebrate models for studying
   developmental and genetic findings in toxicology research, they were
   exposed to fipronil to study detailed elucidating mechanisms with
   hazardous end points of toxicity. Cell cycle arrest-related apoptosis
   supported pathological alterations, such as increased mortality,
   shortened body length, and reduced hatchability. Furthermore, observed
   heart defects, including edema and irregular heartbeat were caused due
   to abnormal blood circulation. In transgenic zebrafish models (fli1:eGFP
   and olig2:dsRED), disrupted blood vessel formations were indicated by
   eGFP(+) endothelial cells. Moreover, neurogenic defects were observed by
   studying dsRED(+) motor neurons and oligodendrocytes. This study
   demonstrates fipronil accumulation in aquatic environment and its
   ability to impair essential processes, such as angiogenesis and
   neurogenesis during early developmental stage of zebrafish, along with
   general developmental toxicity.},

   behavioral effects in larval and adult zebrafish},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Number = {B, SI},
Pages = {220-227},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have grown in usage
   since concerns about the health effects of the previously used
   polybrominated flame retardants led to their being phased out. The
   potential for OPFRs to cause adverse health effects of their own is
   still unexamined. Becaute of their structural similarities to
   organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been heavily
   researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated
   the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl
   phosphate (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP)
   might lead to behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been
   observed with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos.
   Methods: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03 or 03 mu M of TPHP, TDCIPP, or
   chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization. Vehicle control
   consisted of 0.03\% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post fertilization,
   larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day old
   larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to
   adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were
   tested on a battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel
   environment exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and
   predator escape.
   Results: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the
   lifespan. Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 mu M doses of
   chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited significant (p < 0.05) hyperactivity in
   the locomotor assay. Organophosphate exposure significantly (p < 0.05)
   altered the time course of adult zebrafish behavior in the novel
   environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation assays.
   Predator escape behavior was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in fish
   exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused
   hyperactivity in adult fish, with fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of
   TDCIPP exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) elevated locomotor behavior
   in the novel environment assay.
   Discussion: Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral
   impairment that persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader
   research investigating the role of organophosphate compounds, including
   the OPFRs used here, in developmental neurotoxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {54-62},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Antidepressants are used by a substantial number of women in their
   childbearing years. Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since
   untreated depression poses a risk to the mother and child. However, many
   antidepressants readily pass through the placental barrier to reach the
   fetus or may be ingested by the newborn via breastmilk. Little is known
   about the effects of antidepressants on brain development and subsequent
   behavior in young children. In the current study, we used zebrafish as a
   model system to examine the neurodevelopmental effects of three commonly
   prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and bupropion.
   Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and
   were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social
   behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that
   antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and
   differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure
   period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained
   results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by
   organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles
   induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common
   mechanism of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant
   exposures lead to specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. At
   present, it is not known if antidepressants have similar effects in
   human development.},

Abstract = {In this study we explore the sub-lethal effects of two malaria vector
   control pesticides, deltamethrin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT), on Xenopus laevis by incorporating different levels of biological
   organisation. Pesticide accumulation in frog tissue was measured
   alongside liver metabolomics and individual swimming behaviour to assess
   whether changes presented at these different levels, and if such changes
   could be linked between levels. Results showed evidence of concentration
   dependent accumulation of DDT and its metabolites, but no measurable
   accumulation of deltamethrin in adult X. laevis after 96 h of exposure.
   Both DDT and deltamethrin were shown to cause alterations in the liver
   metabolome of X. laevis. We also showed that some of these changes can
   be enhanced in exposure to a mixture of these two pesticides. Initial
   behavioural responses recorded directly after exposure were seen in the
   form of decreased activity, less alterations between mobility states,
   and less time spent at the water surface. This response persisted after
   96 h of exposure to a mixture of the two pesticides. This study shows
   that sub-lethal exposure to pesticides can alter the biochemical
   homeostasis of frogs with the potential to cascade onto behavioural and

Abstract = {Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have
   long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present
   work intended to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the
   pesticide carbaryl on adult fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
   embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to sublethal concentrations of
   carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and then kept in
   standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of behavioral
   tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor
   activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and
   feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations
   of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood.
   Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in
   slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially
   in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while
   during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of
   the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this
   demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly
   demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at
   embryonic stages. This data supports the need of considering this
   scenario in environmental risk evaluations. Further work should focus on
   the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption responsible for the
   effects observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   findings from this review are that: (1) triadimefon occurred widely in
   surface waters, with high rates of detection; (2) abiotic degradation of
   triadimefon was affected by many factors. Stereoselectivity was found
   during biotic degradation and metabolism of triadimefon. Different
   enantiomers can cause various adverse effects, which complicates the
   assessment and requires enantiomers-specific considerations; (3)
   triadimefon exposure can affect organisms by causing multiple toxic
   effects on the thyroid, reproductive system, liver, nervous system as
   well as carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, and it can also act
   synergistically with other pesticides. Long-term, low-dose effects were
   considered to be the main characteristics of toxic effects of
   triadimefon; (4) results of the risk assessment based on probabilistic
   relationships represented by joint probability curves (JPCs) indicated
   that risk of triadimefon was classified as low risk. Conclusion
   Triadimefon occurred widely in surface waters, with high rates of
   detection, while the concentration data of triadimefon in surface water
   is insufficient. Researches about toxic effects and mechanisms of
   triadimefon on invertebrate are needed. Meanwhile, researches about
   toxic effects and environmental exposure of chiral monomers are also
   required. Due to its reproductive toxicity, triadimefon might result in
   adverse effects on the population level or even on the ecosystem level.
   Risk assessments for pesticides that cause long-term and low-dose
   effects on aquatic organisms such as triadimefon need to consider
   higher-level ecological risk.},

Title = {Potential effects of internal physio-ecological changes on the online

   rhythms of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to different chemicals},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {The online biomonitoring of aquatic accidental pollution is very
   important to realize the assessment of complex toxicity. However, the
   monitoring results would be affected greatly by the internal
   physioecological changes of test organisms, and circadian rhythms might
   contribute greatly to this kind of effects. In the present study, the
   behavior responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to different
   concentrations of Deltamethrin, Atrazine, and Thallium (T1) in 15 days
   were investigated using an online behavior monitoring system. The
   results showed that the average behavior strength (BS) value of dark
   period (0.71 +/- 0.16) was lower than that of light period (0.88 +/-
   0.09) in the control group. Similar pattern was observed in all other
   treatments with negative relationship between exposure concentrations
   and mean BS values. It is concluded that the 24 h circadian rhythms in
   the behavior responses of zebrafish (Dario rerio) could be observed
   clearly in the online biomonitoring system, and the online monitoring
   results would be affected obviously in the characteristics of behavior
   periodicity abnormal and time delay. Therefore, it is suggested that
   internal physio-ecological characteristics of organisms must be
   considered once they have the chance to play roles in bio-induced
   technologies. More investigations are warranted to clear the effects of
   internal physio-ecological changes on the exported results. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide designed to selectively inhibit
   insect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Although fipronil is
   often used in or near aquatic environments, few studies have assessed
   the effects of this neurotoxicant on aquatic vertebrates at sensitive
   life stages. We explored the toxicological effects of fipronil on
   embryos and larvae using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) experimental model
   system. Embryos exposed to fipronil at nominal concentrations at or
   above 0.7 mu M (333 mu g/l) displayed notochord degeneration, shortening
   along the rostral-caudal body axis, and ineffective tail flips and
   uncoordinated muscle contractions along the body axis in response to
   touch. This phenotype closely resembles zebrafish locomotor mutants of
   the accordion class and is consistent with loss of reciprocal inhibitory
   neurotransmission by glycinergic commissural interneurons in the spinal
   cord. Consistent with the hypothesis that notochord degeneration may be
   due to abnormal mechanical stress from muscle tetany, the expression
   patterns of gene and protein markers specific to notochord development
   were unaffected by fipronil. Moreover, the degenerative effects of
   fipronil (1.1 mu M) were reversed by coexposure to the sodium channel
   blocker MS-222 (0.6mM). The notochord effects of fipronil were
   phenocopied by exposure to 70 mu M strychnine, a glycinergic receptor
   antagonist. In contrast, exposure to gabazine, a potent vertebrate
   GABA(A) antagonist, resulted in a hyperactive touch response but did not
   cause notochord degeneration. Although specifically developed to target
   insect GABA receptors with low vertebrate toxicity, our results suggest
   that fipronil impairs the development of spinal locomotor pathways in
   fish by inhibiting a structurally related glycine receptor subtype. This
   represents an unanticipated and potentially novel mechanism for fipronil
   toxicity in vertebrates.},

Title = {Behavioural toxicity of environmental relevant concentrations of a
   glyphosate commercial formulation - RoundUp (R) UltraMax - During
   zebrafish embryogenesis},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The use of herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient (a.i.) has
   increased dramatically in recent years, with its residues often being
   found in either soil or water. Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about
   its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health.
   Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a
   commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp (R) UltraMax), at
   environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a
   set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2
   and 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for
   72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae
   were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the
   larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the
   general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related
   behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were
   assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the
   exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related
   behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was
   observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations.
   Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the
   larvae exposed to 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an
   aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory-
   motor coordination during development. In general, these results
   indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based
   formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results
   obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should
   not be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {392},
Pages = {32-39},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide in the world, due
   to the wide scale adoption of transgenic glyphosate resistant crops
   after its introduction in 1996. Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is
   commonly applied as an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup (R).
   This pesticide contains several adjuvants, which may promote an unknown
   toxicity. The indiscriminate application poses numerous problems, both
   for the health of the applicators and consumers, and for the
   environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death of
   plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio redo) is quickly gaining popularity
   in behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals,
   sensitivity to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost,
   short spawning intervals, external fertilization, transparency of
   embryos through larval stages, and rapid development. The aim of this
   study was evaluate the effects of glyphosate and Roundup on behavioral
   and morphological parameters in zebrafish larvae and adults. Zebrafish
   larvae at 3 days post-fertilization and adults were exposed to
   glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) or Roundup (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5
   mg/L) for 96 h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the
   analysis of locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for
   the larvae and exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance
   memory for adult zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant
   differences in the locomotor activity and aversive behavior after
   glyphosate or Roundup' exposure when compared to the control group. Our
   findings demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate at the concentration
   of 0.5 mg/L, Roundup at 0.065 or 0.5 mg/L reduced the distance traveled,
   the mean speed and the line crossings in adult zebrafish. A decreased
   ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5 mg/L of
   glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5 mg/L of Roundup{''}-treated adult
   zebrafish demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both
   glyphosate and Roundup (R) reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest
   that there are small differences between the effects induced by
   glyphosate and Roundup', altering morphological and behavioral
   parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity and
   cellular response.},

   Focus on mitochondrial function and larval activity in early staged
   zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {452},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Strobilurin fungicides are used globally and have been detected in
   microgram per liter concentrations in aquatic environments. Here, we
   determined the potential toxicity of four commonly used strobilurins
   (azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin) on
   mitochondrial function and locomotor activity of larval zebrafish at an
   environmentally relevant level. As the mode of action of strobilurins in
   fungi is binding to cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III, we
   evaluated exposure effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of
   zebrafish, by measuring oxygen consumption rates, mitochondria-related
   enzyme activities, and transcripts levels for genes associated with the
   electron transfer chain and citric acid cycle. We found that 50 nM
   pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin lowered basal respiration,
   oligomycin-induced ATP respiration, and maximal respiration of embryos.
   Dysfunction in mitochondrial bioenergetics was associated with changes
   in mitochondrial complex III activity and transcripts of oxidative
   respiration and stress-related genes. Lower activity of complex III, and
   reduced cytb mRNA levels were hypothesized to contribute to reduced
   electron supply to complex IV and V. Both coxI and atp6 were
   up-regulated, suggesting a compensatory response to impaired oxidative
   respiration. Cluster analysis indicated that strobilurin-induced
   oxidative stress and cytb transcript were related to impaired oxidative
   phosphorylation. We also assessed larval behavior responses, as reduced
   ATP can affect activity. We observed that pyraclostrobin and
   trifloxystrobin induced hypoactive responses in zebrafish. At 50 nM,
   azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl exerted no effects on mitochondrial
   function nor locomotion of zebrafish. Studies such as this are important
   for determining sublethal toxicity to these fungicides, as widespread
   detection of strobilurins in aquatic environments suggests there is a
   potential for adverse effects in aquatic organisms.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate is a broad spectrum herbicide used aggressively in
   agricultural practices as well as home garden care. Although labeled

   mimic chronic exposures to sublethal doses that organisms in the

   widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental
   toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model
   system to study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart.
   Treatment by embryo soaking with 50 mu g/ml glyphosate starting at
   gastrulation results in structural abnormalities in the atrium and
   ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs inversus as well as decreased
   heartbeats by 48 h as determined by live imaging and
   immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as
   determined using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects
   noted at 48 h post fertilization are due to early stage alterations in
   myocardial precursors, we also investigate cardiomyocyte development
   with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in situ hybridization and find
   alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns during early cardiac
   patterning stages. We conclude that glyphosate is developmentally toxic

Abstract = {The neurotoxic effects of a commercial formulation of Azadirachta indica
   A. Juss, also called neem or nim, in adult zebrafish were determined
   using behavioral models. General activity, anxiety-like effects, and
   learning and memory in a passive avoidance task were assessed after
   exposure to 20 or 40 mu l/L neem. The results showed that 20 mu l/L neem
   reduced the number of runs. Both neem concentrations increased the
   number of climbs to the water surface, and 40 mu l/L increased the
   number of tremors. In the anxiety test, the 20 mu l/L dose increased the
   number of entries in the light side compared with controls, but the
   latency to enter the dark side and the freezing behavior in this side
   did not changed. In relation to controls, the 40 mu l/L neem reduced the
   latency to enter in the light side, did not change the number of entries
   in this side and increased freezing behavior in the light side. In the
   passive avoidance test, pre-training and pre-test neem exposure to 40 mu
   l/L decreased the response to the learning task. Thus, no impairment was

Title = {Feeding behavior of early life stages of the zebrafish Danio rerio is
   altered by exposure to glyphosate},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Glyphosate levels and the transfer of glyphosate across trophic levels
   have rarely been studied in zooplankton. The food preferences of
   zebrafish during the first-feeding stage (which is critical for the
   survival of organisms), were analyzed because of the requirement for
   live food. Larval survival begins to be affected when glyphosate intake
   exceeds 0.3666 mu g/larvae/day, in the case that only the food is
   contaminated; if the medium is also contaminated, the effects on
   survival start from 0.2456 mu g/larvae/day. It was shown that glyphosate
   was more likely to be incorporated through the medium than through the
   food (zooplankton), which supports the results of previous studies that
   have ruled out the potential for biomagnification. The bioconcentration
   factor (BCF) of glyphosate was determined using an ELISA tests specific
   to measure glyphosate in the fish D. rerio, the rotifers Brachionus
   calyciflorus and Lecane papuana, and the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia.
   The experimental design consisted in exposing seven zebrafish adults per
   replica (four replicates) in three treatments 1, 5, and 10 mg/L of
   glyphosate for 96 h to obtain bioconcentration factors in the gills,
   liver, and muscle. These concentrations were selected as potential
   glyphosate concentrations right after application as double highest
   reported concentration. Glyphosate levels in zooplankton can represent
   up to 6.26\% of the total weight of rotifers (BFC = 60.35) and in
   zebrafish adult organs were less than 8 mu g/mg of tissue (BCF values <
   6). Although glyphosate does not biomagnify, our results suggest that
   glyphosate affected the dynamics between zooplankton and zebrafish
   larvae, diminishing survival and feeding rates, given that zooplankton
   species bioconcentrate glyphosate in large quantities. The BCF values
   found in this contribution are higher than expected. Glyphosate exposure
   affected energy metabolism and feeding behavior of zebrafish larvae,
   which presented high mortality rates at environmentally relevant
   concentrations.},

Title = {Carbofuran induces increased anxiety-like behaviors in female zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) through disturbing dopaminergic/norepinephrinergic system},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Carbofuran, a carbamate pesticide, is widely used in developing
   countries to manage insect pests. Studies have found that carbofuran
   posed potential risks for the neurotransmitter systems of non-target
   species, we speculated that these disruptive effects on the
   neurotransmitter systems could trigger anxiety-like behaviors. In this
   study, female zebrafish were exposed to environmental levels (5, 50, and
   500 mu g/L) of carbofuran for 48 h to evaluate the effects of carbofuran
   on anxiety-like behaviors. Results showed that zebrafish exhibited more
   anxiety-like behaviors which proved by the observed higher bottom trend
   and more erratic movements in the novel tank after carbofuran treatment.
   In order to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of
   carbofuran-induced anxiety-promoting effects, we measured the levels of
   neurotransmitters, precursors, and major metabolites, along with the
   level of gene expression and the enzyme activities involved in
   neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. The results demonstrated that
   acute carbofuran exposure stimulated the mRNA expression and enzyme
   activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, which sequentially induced the
   increased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Tyrosine hydroxylase
   inhibitor relieved the anxiety-related changes induced by carbofuran,
   confirming the overactive tyrosine hydroxylase-mediated accumulation of
   dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain was one of the main reasons for
   carbofuran-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the female zebrafish.
   Overall, our study indicated the environmental health risks of carbamate
   pesticide in inducing neurobehavioral disorders and provided novel
   insights into the investigation of the relevant underlying mechanisms.

Title = {Enantioselective aquatic toxicity and degradation in soil of the chiral
   fungicide oxathiapiprolin},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {836},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Oxathiapiprolin is an efficient and chiral fungicide for
   peronosporomycetes. The enantioselective environmental behavior and
   ecotoxicity of oxathiapiprolin are still unclear. The enantioselectivity
   of oxathiapiprolin enantiomers was explored, including their acute
   toxicity toward aquatic plants (Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa and
   Soirodela polyrhiza) along with their influence on photosynthetic
   pigment production, the acute toxicity and morphological differences for
   the embryos, larvae and adult stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio), and the
   degradation in four typical soils (aerobic, anaerobic and sterilized
   conditions). The enantioselective toxicity of oxathiapiprolin showed
   that the toxicity of R-oxathiapiprolin was 1.8-2.1 times higher than
   that of S-oxathiapiprolin toward the two aquatic plants. In particular,
   the content of photosynthetic pigments decreased significantly stronger
   after exposure to R-oxathiapiprolin compared with S-oxathiapiprolin. The
   LC50 values of R-oxathiapiprolin in zebrafish in the different life
   stages were 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of S-oxathiapiprolin. The
   zebrafish embryos were most sensitive to the oxathiapiprolin
   enantiomers. After exposure to R-oxathiapiprolin, zebrafish embryos
   showed noticeable hatching delays, inhibition or deformation.
   R-oxathiapiprolin degraded preferentially in all four soils, with an
   enantiomeric fraction (EF) ranging from 0.28 to 0.42 under aerobic
   conditions. Enantioselective degradation was not found under anaerobic
   and sterilized conditions. The enantioselectivity of new chiral
   pesticides should be fully considered in risk assessments to provide a
   basis for the development and preparation of pure optical enantiomers.},

Title = {Behavioral and developmental toxicity assessment of the strobilurin
   fungicide fenamidone in zebrafish embryos/larvae (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {228},
Month = {DEC 25},
Abstract = {Strobilurin fungicides are among the most widely used in the world and
   have characteristics that include high water solubility and toxicity to
   aquatic organisms. While several studies report on mechanisms of
   toxicity of strobilurins in fish, there are no data on the sub-lethal
   toxicity of fish to the fungicide fenamidone. To address this gap,
   survival and hatch rate, deformities, mitochondrial bioenergetics,
   expression of oxidative stress and apoptotic genes, and behavior
   (locomotor activity and anxiolytic-related behaviors) were assessed in
   zebrafish embryos and larvae following exposure to fenamidone.
   Fenamidone negatively affected development of zebrafish embryos, causing
   a delay of hatching time at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mu M. Fenamidone
   caused morphological deformities in zebrafish, including pericardial
   edema, yolk sac edema, tail deformities, and spinal curvature. Exposure
   to 1.5 mu M fenamidone reduced surface area of swim bladder in larvae at
   6 dpf. Fenamidone significantly reduced oxygen consumption rates of
   embryos; 5 mu M fenamidone decreased basal respiration (similar to
   85\%), oligomycin induced ATP-linked respiration (similar to 70\%),
   FCCP-induced maximal respiration (similar to 75\%) and nonmitochondrial
   respiration (similar to 90\%) compared to controls. Sod2 mRNA levels
   were decreased by fenamidone in larval fish. Locomotor activity was
   significantly decreased in zebrafish larvae following exposure to 2 mu M
   fenamidone but there was no evidence for anxiolytic nor anxiety-related
   behaviors (exposures of 100 nM up to 1.5 mu M). This study addresses a
   data gap for potential risks associated with fenamidone exposure in
   developing fish.},

Title = {The effect of the insecticide diazinon on the osmoregulation and the
   avoidance response of the white leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is
   salinity dependent},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {206},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Diazinon is one of the insecticides that represent a high risk for Costa
   Rican estuarine environments due to its widespread use in pineapple
   plantations. In estuaries, organisms are frequently submitted to stress
   caused by natural factors (e.g., continuous changes in salinity levels)
   and, additionally, to stress due to contamination. Therefore, the
   driving question of this study was: will organisms be more susceptible
   to suffer the deleterious effects caused by diazinon because of the
   stress resulting from the salinity changes? The estuarine shrimp Penaeus
   vannamei was used as the model organism and two responses were measured:
   osmoregulation (the physiological effect after a forced and continuous
   24 h-exposure) and avoidance {[}the behavioural effect after a short (3
   h) non-forced, multi-compartmented exposure]. Juveniles were exposed to
   diazinon (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) at three different salinities (10,
   20 and 30). Disruption in the capacity to regulate the haemolymph
   osmotic pressure was observed at a salinity of 30 in individuals exposed
   to diazinon and methanol (used as vehicle). At that salinity, the
   ability of shrimps to detect and avoid the highest diazinon
   concentrations was impaired. P. vannamei juveniles inhabit environments
   with a high variation in salinity, but with an optimum osmotic point
   close to a salinity of 20; therefore, the higher the salinity, the
   greater the vulnerability of shrimps to the effects of diazinon. From an
   ecological point of view, this combined effect of salinity and
   contamination might also limit the spatial distribution of the
   organisms.},

Title = {Environmental chemicals affect circadian rhythms: An underexplored
   effect influencing health and fitness in animals and humans},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Circadian rhythms control the life of virtually all organisms. They
   regulate numerous aspects ranging from cellular processes to
   reproduction and behavior. Besides the light-dark cycle, there are
   additional environmental factors that regulate the circadian rhythms in
   animals as well as humans. Here, we outline the circadian rhythm system
   and considers zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a representative vertebrate
   organism. We characterize multiple physiological processes, which are
   affected by circadian rhythm disrupting compounds (circadian
   disrupters). We focus on and summarize 40 natural and anthropogenic
   environmental circadian disrupters in fish. They can be divided into six
   major categories: steroid hormones, metals, pesticides and biocides,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, neuroactive drugs and other compounds such as
   cyanobacterial toxins and bisphenol A. Steroid hormones as well as
   metals are most studied. Especially for progestins and glucocorticoids,
   circadian dysregulation was demonstrated in zebrafish on the molecular
   and physiological level, which comprise mainly behavioral alterations.
   Our review summarizes the current state of knowledge on circadian
   disrupters, highlights their risks to fish and identifies knowledge gaps
   in animals and humans. While most studies focus on transcriptional and
   behavioral alterations, additional effects and consequences are
   underexplored. Forthcoming studies should explore, which additional
   environmental circadian disrupters exist. They should clarify the
   underlying molecular mechanisms and aim to better understand the
   consequences for physiological processes.},

   stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Triazine herbicide atrazine is considered to be moderately toxic to
   various aquatic animals. The aim of our study was to evaluate the acute
   embryotoxicity of atrazine and its two degradation products,
   desisopropylatrazine and desethylatrazine, and their mixture to the
   early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) by means of a modified
   method of the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) Test - OECD guideline
   236. Toxic effects were studied by the evaluation of lethal endpoints
   and development of disorders. Furthermore, sublethal endpoints such as
   hatching rate, formation of somites, development of eyes, spontaneous
   movement, heartbeat, blood circulation, pigmentation and occurrence of
   edema at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post fertilization were assessed. Newly
   fertilized eggs were exposed to various concentrations of atrazine,
   desisopropylatrazine and desethylatrazine, and their combination 0.3,
   30, 100, 300, 1000, 3,000 and 10,000 mu g/l, which represent
   environmentally relevant levels of these pollutants in surface waters
   and multiples of these concentrations to find out if the toxic effect
   depends on dose. Single substances and their combination were not
   associated with a negative effect on mortality. Rare malformations were
   observed during these embryonal toxicity tests. Only pericardial edema
   was recorded during the monitored observation. A significant increase in
   the occurrence of pericardial edema between the control 0\% and the
   experimental group 17.6 \%) was found only in the group exposed to the
   highest concentration of a triazine herbicide combination (10,000 mu
   g/l) at 72 and 96 h post fertilization. Obtained results indicate that
   especially higher not environmentally relevant concentrations of
   atrazine, its metabolites or their combination present a potencial risk
   of embryotoxicity for zebrafish.},

Title = {Chlorpyrifos and malathion have opposite effects on behaviors and brain
   size that are not correlated to changes in AChE activity},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {50-58},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Organophosphates, a type of neurotoxicant pesticide, are used globally
   for the treatment of pests on croplands and are therefore found in a
   large number of conventional foods. These pesticides are harmful and
   potentially deadly if ingested or inhaled in large quantities by causing
   a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the
   central and peripheral nervous system. However, much less is known about
   the effects of exposure to small quantities of the pesticides on neural
   systems and behavior during development. In the current study we used
   zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects of two of the most
   widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on zebrafish
   behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the
   organophosphates during different time points in development and then
   tested at 5 days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental
   and AChE abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that
   chlorpyrifos and malathion cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such
   as swim speed (hypoactivity vs. hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally,
   the pesticides affect only certain behaviors, such as thigmotaxis,
   during specific time points in development that are unrelated to changes
   in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not chlorpyrifos
   also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions compared
   to controls by 5 days postfertilization. We conclude that exposure to
   very low concentrations of organophosphate pesticides during development
   cause abnormalities in behavior and brain size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Paternal exposure to a common herbicide alters the behavior and
   serotonergic system of zebrafish offspring},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Increasingly, studies are revealing that endocrine disrupting chemicals
   (EDCs) can alter animal behavior. Early life exposure to EDCs may
   permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the
   effects of EDCs may not be isolated to a single generation - offspring
   may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed
   the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance
   moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone,
   and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain mRNA of genes involved in
   the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, htr1Aa, htr1B,
   htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed to
   atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile
   development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the
   effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was
   quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced
   interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the
   latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring.
   Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat
   affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of
   aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to
   correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that
   this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group.
   Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a
   variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system
   dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects. Further research
   is needed to explore transgenerational effects on behavior and possible
   mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.},

Title = {Transcriptome network data in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) following
   exposure to the phenylpyrazole fipronil},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole pesticide that is used in both residential
   and agricultural applications. Fipronil is detected in run-offand water
   systems that are near areas in which the pesticide has been applied. The
   pesticide acts to antagonize gamma aminobutyric acid receptors, leading
   to overexcitation in the central nervous system. Fipronil has relatively
   high toxicity to fish, but the mechanisms underlying the toxicity are
   not well understood in embryonic stages. Zebrafish embryos were exposed
   to a single concentration of fipronil for 48 h at similar to 3-4
   h-post-fertilization. Following a 7-day depuration phase, transcriptome
   and behavioral analyses were conducted. Transcriptomics identified
   neural processes as those differentially expressed with different doses
   of fipronil (0.2 mu g, 200 mu g and 2 mg fipronil/L). Gene networks
   associated with astrocyte differentiation, myelination, neural tube
   development, brain stem response, innervation, nerve regeneration,
   astrocyte differentiation, among other pathways were altered with
   exposure. In addition, miRNA-related events are disrupted by fipronil
   exposure and genes associated with primary or pri-miRNA processing were
   increased in larval fish exposed to the pesticide. These data present
   putative mechanisms associated with neurological impacts at later ages
   of zebrafish. This is important because it is not clear how early
   exposure to pesticides like fipronil affect central nervous system
   function and organisms later in life. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Environmentally relevant mixture of S-metolachlor and its two
   metabolites affects thyroid metabolism in zebrafish embryos},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {221},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Herbicides and their metabolites are often detected in water bodies
   where they may cause adverse effects to non-target organisms. Their
   effects at environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear,
   especially concerning mixtures of pesticides. This study thus
   investigated the impacts of one of the most used herbicides:
   S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic acid (MOA)
   and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of
   zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual
   substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf
   (hours post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints
   such as malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae,
   spontaneous movements, heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression
   levels of eight genes linked to the thyroid system disruption, oxidative
   stress defense, mitochondrial metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and
   retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway were analyzed. Exposure to
   S-metolachlor (1 mu g/L) and the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each
   substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of 21 hpf
   embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in
   larvae exposed to more than 100 mu g/L of individual substances
   (craniofacial deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac
   malabsorption) and to 30 mu g/L of each substance in the pesticide
   mixture (spine deformation). No effect on hatching success, length of
   larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found. Strong responses
   were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53 gene
   regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each
   substance; MESA 30 mu g/L; and MOA 100 mu g/L), as induction of cyp26a1
   gene encoding cytochrome P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each
   substance). Genes implicated in the thyroid system regulation (dio2,
   thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the environmentally relevant
   concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) and
   MESA metabolite (1 mu g/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was
   revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related
   developmental malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac
   abnormalities), and reduced spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the
   thyroid system disruption represents a likely hypothesis behind the
   effects caused by the low environmental concentrations of S-metolachlor,
   its two metabolites and their mixture.},

Title = {Mitochondrial bioenergetics and locomotor activity are altered in
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to the bipyridylium herbicide
   diquat},

Abstract = {Diquat is a non-selective bipyridylium herbicide which has replaced its
   sister compound paraquat, as paraquat is associated to an increased risk
   for Parkinson's disease. However, the propensity of diquat to propagate
   reactive oxygen species ensures that diquat remains an exposure risk in
   non-target organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
   were exposed to diquat (1, 10, 100 mu M) beginning at similar to 6 h
   post fertilization for up to 7 days to learn more about the mechanisms
   underlying diquat toxicity during vertebrate development. Zebrafish
   embryos exposed to diquat for 96 h did not show any significant
   mortality nor deformity compared to controls. Moreover, there was no
   difference in the timing of hatch, an indicator of stress, for fish
   exposed to diquat. To determine whether changes in mitochondrial
   bioenergetics occurred in early development as a response to diquat
   exposure, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole embryos. Basal
   respiration and ATP production were decreased following a 24 h diquat
   exposure at 100 mu M, suggesting that diquat negatively affects
   oxidative phosphorylation. We also assessed locomotor behavior as a
   sensitive endpoint for impaired activity and neurotoxicity. Seven day
   old (7 dpf) zebrafish treated with diquat at the highest doses tested
   (10-100 mu M) showed an increase (hyper-activity) in total distance
   travelled, velocity, movement cumulative duration, and overall activity
   compared to unexposed fish. Lastly, in 7d fish, we measured transcripts
   related to redox balance and apoptosis as diquat has been reported to
   induce oxidative stress and can affect mitochondrial bioenergetics.
   Larvae exposed to 10 mu M diquat showed higher transcript levels of
   catalase compared to control fish, implying that reactive oxygen species
   are produced following diquat exposure. Transcript levels of sod1, sod2,
   bcl2, bax and caspase 3 however did not vary in abundance among
   treatments with diquat. This study improves mechanistic understanding of
   diquat in fish at early stages of development and presents evidence that
   diquat disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics and behavior.},

Abstract = {Fish live in waters of contaminant flux. In three urban, fish-bearing
   waterways of British Columbia, Canada, we found the active ingredients
   of WeedEx (R), KillEx (R), and Roundup (R) herbicide formulations
   (2,4-D, dicamba, glyphosate, and mecoprop) at low to high ng/L
   concentrations (0.26 to 309 ng/L) in routine conditions, i.e., no rain
   for at least one week. Following rain, these concentrations increased by
   an average of eightfold, suggesting runoff as a major route of herbicide
   introduction in these waterways. To determine whether fish might be able
   to limit point-source exposures through sensory-driven behaviors, we
   introduced pulses of representative herbicide mixtures to individual
   adult zebrafish (a model species) in flow-through tanks. Fish did the
   opposite of limit exposure; they chose to spend more time in pulses of
   herbicide mixtures representative of those that may occur with rain
   events. This attraction response was not altered by a previous 4-d
   exposure to lower concentrations of the mixtures, suggesting fish will
   not learn from previous exposures. However, previous exposures did alter
   an attraction response to an amino acid prevalent in food (L-alanine).
   The present study demonstrates that fish living within urban waterways
   may elect to place themselves in herbicide-contaminated environments and
   that these exposures may alter their behavioral responses to cues
   necessary for survival. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:2046-2054. (C)

Abstract = {Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropglamine-s-triazine) a widely

   Teratogeny of atrazine was examined during the first 48 h of zebrafish
   development (embryo test) and correlated to effects on the microsomal
   and soluble glutathione S-transferases (m-/sGST; EC 2.5.1.18), Atrazine
   at 4 mg/L disturbed the normal development to long pec stage, at
   concentrations between 10 and 20mg/L it caused retardations in
   organogenesis, a slowdown of movements, and functional disturbances of
   heart and circulatory system, m- and sGST activities were affected by
   atrazine in all investigated developmental stages, Atrazine elevated the
   mGST activity dose dependently up to a concentration of 5 mg/L, and the
   sGST up to 1 mg/L, Higher atrazine concentrations caused a decrease of
   GST activity, especially of the sGST of the younger stages, 32 cells and
   75\% epiboly. This might indicate that the detoxication system itself is
   affected, which then gives rise to morphological abnormalities during
   fish development. In vitro tests were performed to purify and
   characterize GST-formed atrazine metabolites by the use of ESI-HPLC-MS,
   mGST showed higher conversion rates compared to sGST. (C) 2001 Academic

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Triazole fungicides are increasingly used in North America to combat
   mold and fungi, in order to protect vegetables, citrus, ornamental
   plants and field crops. To determine the biological impacts of
   tebuconazole in nontarget aquatic organisms, early life stage zebrafish
   were exposed to 0.1-100 mu M tebuconazole for 120 h (5 dpf). There was a
   significant increase in mortality over time and at 100 mu M, only 50\%
   of the animals survived 96 h compared to > 95\% for all other
   experimental groups. There was evidence for increased hatching time with
   10 mu M tebuconazole compared to the control group (similar to 7 h
   longer at 50\% total hatch) or a lack of hatch observed with 100 mu M.
   Oxidative respiration and behavior were evaluated to assess whether the
   fungicide impaired energy-associated processes. Oxygen consumption rates
   in embryos (exposed from similar to 6 hpf) were determined with exposure
   to 2.5, 25, 50, 100 pM tebuconazole for 24 h using the XFe24
   Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Embryos treated with 100 pM showed a
   similar to 60\% reduction in basal respiration, indicating impaired
   oxygen consumption and/or changes in resource allocation (e.g.
   anti-oxidant production, metabolite synthesis). Environmentally-relevant
   concentrations of tebuconazole did not affect oxidative phosphorylation.
   As behavior is a sensitive endpoint for toxicity, we measured the dark
   photokinesis response and conducted a light-dark preference test in 6
   dpf larvae following a sub-chronic exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M
   tebuconazole beginning with 6 hpf embryos. It was observed in two
   independent experiments for dark photokinesis that 10 mu M tebuconazole
   reduced total distance moved (i.e. hypoactivity) in the dark period by
   similar to 25-35\%. In the light-dark preference test, there was an
   increase for mean time in dark zone (similar to 100\% increase in the
   average time/visits per second) and frequency in dark zone (increase of
   similar to 35\% in average number of visits) with tebuconazole,
   suggestive of anxiolytic behavior at environmentally-relevant doses.
   This study demonstrates that exposure to tebuconazole can affect
   survival, hatch time, oxidative phosphorylation, and behavioral activity
   of early-staged zebrafish. While survival, hatch time, and mitochondrial
   bioenergetics were not different than control fish at
   environmentally-relevant levels of tebuconazole, behavioral responses
   were detected at concentrations reported in some aquatic environments.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {761},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Benoxacor, a chiral herbicide safener for S-metolachlor, has been
   detected in streams. However, the potential risk this poses to aquatic
   ecosystems is not clear. This study used zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
   as a model to assess the enantioselective toxicity of benoxacor and its
   effects on biological activity and development from 2 h to 96 h
   post-fertilization (hpf). Results showed that benoxacor had negative
   effects on hatchability, malformations, and mortality. Compared to
   either individual enantiomer, embryos exposed to Rac-benoxacor had
   higher acute and developmental toxicities, glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities, and nrf 2
   expression levels. They also had lower superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme activity and krt
   17, tbx 16, osx, cat, bcl 2, bax, and ifn expression levels.
   High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that Rac-benoxacor had a greater
   effect on gene regulation than either enantiomer. Gene Ontology
   enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses
   demonstrated that changes in oxidoreductase activity, cellular lipid
   metabolic process, and catalytic activity related genes may be due to
   the enantioselective effects of benoxacor isomers. These results suggest
   that the ecotoxicology data and safety knowledge about the effects of
   chiral benoxacor on zebrafish should be considered in future
   environmental risk evaluation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The current research progression efforts for investigating novel
   treatments for exposure to organophosphorus (OP) compounds that inhibit
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE), including pesticides and chemical warfare
   nerve agents (CWNAs), rely solely on in vitro cell assays and in vivo
   rodent models. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular,
   well-established vertebrate model in biomedical research that offers
   high-throughput capabilities and genetic manipulation not readily
   available with rodents. A number of research studies have investigated
   the effects of subacute developmental exposure to OP pesticides in
   zebrafish, observing detrimental effects on gross morphology, neuronal
   development, and behavior. Few studies, however, have utilized this
   model to evaluate treatments, such as oxime reactivators,
   anticholinergics, or anticonvulsants, following acute exposure.
   Preliminary work has investigated the effects of CWNA exposure. The
   results clearly demonstrated relative toxicity and oxime efficacy
   similar to that reported for the rodent model. This review surveys the
   current literature utilizing zebrafish as a model for OP exposure and
   highlights its potential use as a high-throughput system for evaluating
   AChE reactivator antidotal treatments to acute pesticide and CWNA

Abstract = {The use of pesticides has continue grown over recent years, leading to
   several environmental and health concerns, such as the contamination of

   affecting populations that are not primary targets of these complex
   chemical mixtures. In this work, we investigate lethal and sublethal
   effects of acute exposure of methomyl commercial formulation in
   zebrafish embryo and larvae. Methomyl is a broad-spectrum carbamate
   insecticide and acaricide that acts primarily in acetylcholinesterase
   inhibition (AChE). Methomyl formulation 96 h-LC50 was determined through
   the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test (FET) and resulted in 1.2 g/L +/-
   0.04. Sublethal 6-day exposure was performed in six methomyl formulation
   concentrations (0.5; 1.0; 2.2; 4.8; 10.6; 23.3 mg/L) to evaluate
   developmental, physiological, morphological, behavioral, biochemical,
   and molecular endpoints of zebrafish early-development. Methomyl
   affected embryo hatching and larva morphology and behavior, especially
   in higher concentrations; resulting in smaller body and eyes size,
   failure in swimming bladder inflation, hypolocomotor activity, and
   concentration-dependent reduction of AChE activity; demonstrating
   methomyl strong acute toxicity and neurotoxic effect.},

   and degradation in soils},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Volume = {122},
Pages = {145-153},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tebuconazole and myclobutanil are two widely used triazole fungicides,
   both comprising two enantiomers with different fungicidal activity.
   However, their non-target toxicity and environmental behavior with
   respect to enantioselectivity have received limited attention. In the
   present study, tebuconazole and myclobutanil enantiomers were isolated
   and used to evaluate the occurrence of enantioselectivity in their acute
   toxicity to three non-target organisms (Scenedesmus obliquus, Daphnia
   magna, and Danio rerio). Significant differences were found:
   R-(-)-tebuconazole was about 1.4-5.9 times more toxic than
   S-(+)-tebuconazole; rac-myclobutanil was about 1.3-6.1 and 1.4-7.3 more
   toxic than (-)-myclobutanil and (+)-myclobutanil, respectively.
   Enantioselectivity was further investigated in terms of fungicide
   degradation in seven soil samples, which were selected to cover a broad
   range of soil properties. In aerobic or anaerobic soils, the
   S-(+)-tebuconazole degraded faster than R-(-)-tebuconazole, and the
   enantioselectivity showed a correlation with soil organic carbon
   content. (+)-Myclobutanil was preferentially degraded than
   (-)-myclobutanil in aerobic soils, whereas both enantiomers degraded at
   similar rates in anaerobic soils. Apparent correlations of
   enantioselectivity with soil pH and soil texture were observed for
   myclobutanil under aerobic conditions. In addition, both fungicides were
   configurationally stable in soils, i.e., no enantiomerization was found.
   Enantioselectivity may be a common phenomenon in both aquatic toxicity
   and biodegradation of chiral triazole fungicides, and this should be
   considered when assessing ecotoxicological risks of these compounds in
   the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cyproconazole is a triazole fungicide used to protect a diverse range of
   fruits, vegetables, and grain crops. As such, it has the potential to
   enter aquatic environments and affect non-target organisms. The
   objective of this study was to assess the acute toxicity of the triazole
   fungicide cyproconazole to zebrafish embryos by assessing mortality,
   developmental defects, morphological abnormality, oxidative respiration,
   and locomotor activity following a 96-h exposure. Zebrafish embryos at
   6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either a solvent control
   (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mu M
   cyproconazole for 96 h. Data indicated that cyproconazole exhibited low
   toxicity to zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC50 value of 90.6 mu M (
   26.4 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos/larvae displayed a significant decrease in
   spontaneous movement, hatching rate, and heartbeats/20 s with 50, 100,
   and 250 mu M cyproconazole exposure. Malformations (i.e., pericardial
   edema, yolk sac edema, tail deformation, and spine deformation) were
   also detected in zebrafish exposed to ae<yen> 50 mu M cyproconazole,
   with significant increases in cumulative deformity rate at 48, 72, and
   96 hpf. In addition, a 20-30\% decrease in basal and oligomycin-induced
   ATP respiration was observed after 24-h exposure to 500 mu M
   cyproconazole in embryos. To determine if cyproconazole affected
   locomotor activity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae
   following 7-day exposure to 1, 10, and 25 mu M cyproconazole in two
   independent trials. Activity in the dark period was decreased for
   zebrafish exposed to 25 mu M cyproconazole in the first trial, and
   hypoactivity was also observed in zebrafish exposed to 1 mu M
   cyproconazole in a second trial, suggesting that cyproconazole can
   affect locomotor activity. These data improve understanding of the
   toxicity of cyproconazole in developing zebrafish and contribute to
   environmental risk assessments for the triazole fungicides on aquatic
   organisms. We report that, based on the overall endpoints assessed,
   cyproconazole exhibits low risk for developing fish embryos, as many
   effects were observed above environmentally-relevant levels.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In animals, hatching represents the transition point from a developing
   embryo to a free-living individual, the larva. This process is finely
   regulated by many endogenous and environmental factors and has been
   shown to be sensitive to a variety of chemical agents. It is commonly
   evaluated in bioassays in order to establish the effects of different
   agents on early development and reproductive capabilities in fish and
   other aquatic animals. In fish, the breakdown of the chorion is achieved
   by the secretion of choriolysin by hatching gland cells (HGCs) into the
   perivitelline space (PVS), coupled with spontaneous movements of the
   developing larva. In this work, we used zebrafish to assay the effects
   of a family of widely used agrochemicals-triazoles Triadimefon (FON),
   Triadimenol (NOL) and free triazole (1,2,4-T)-on hatching success. We
   found a strong inhibition of hatching by triazole exposure which was
   correlated with morphological changes and a reduction in the secretory
   function of the HGCs. As a consequence, the release of choriolytic
   enzymes by HGCs was reduced. We also found that HGC secretion reduction
   after exposure to FON can be rescued by co-incubation with a dopamine D2
   receptor antagonist but not by antagonists of the D1-like receptors.
   This suggests a specific pathway through which this family of fungicides
   may be impairing a critical event in the fish life cycle.},

   enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior and toxic effects of
   penthiopyrad in zebrafish. Significant enantioselective bioaccumulation
   was observed when exposed to penthiopyrad at two dose levels:
   S-(+)-penthiopyrad was preferentially accumulated. Moreover,
   S-(+)-penthiopyrad caused oxidative stress in zebrafish liver. The
   results of real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that exposure to
   penthiopyrad also enantioselectivity interfered with the expression of
   mitochondrial respiratory complexes, mtDNA synthesis, lipid metabolism
   and apoptosis-related genes. S-(+)-penthiopyrad significantly decreased
   most of the expression of the above gene, which showed higher toxic
   effects. We inferred that the toxicity mechanism of penthiopyrad was
   caused by lipid metabolism disorder and mitochondrial dysfunction in
   zebrafish, and further leads to apoptosis even DNA damage. This study
   provides more accurate data to investigate the environmental impact of
   penthiopyrad at the enantiomer level.},

Title = {Ecological risk of pesticide contamination in a Brazilian river located

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Aquatic environments are affected by the use of pesticides in
   agricultural areas near rivers. To assess the impact of pesticide
   residues on affected environments Denio rerio (zebrafish) embryos have
   become an alternative model for biomonitoring studies. In the present
   study, zebrafish embryos were used as bioindicator of water quality in
   the Vacacaf river, located in the city of Santa Maria, southern Brazil.
   We hypothesized that it would be possible to observe changes in the
   biomarkers tested in the embryos. Exposures were performed over a total
   of eight months during the year 2018 using water collected in a river
   located near agricultural areas. Twenty-four pesticides were found in
   river water samples. The most frequently found were atrazine, quinclorac
   and domazone. During exposure (96 h) spontaneous movement, the heart
   rate and hatching rate were evaluated. After the exposure time the
   embryos were euthanized for biochemical assays. We analyzed biomarkers
   such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS),
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and
   catalase (CAT). We observed increases in GST and TBARS, especially
   during periods of major water contamination such as January, February,
   October, and November. Pesticides can affect the development of native
   species that reproduce during periods of high agricultural production.
   These results demonstrate the potential use of biochemical parameters
   combined with developmental and behavioral analyses in zebrafish embryos
   for biomonitoring studies.},

Title = {Developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of penconazole enantiomers
   exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {267},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Penconazole is a widely used chiral triazole bactericide that may
   adversely affect the environment. It contains two corresponding
   enantiomers and there may be differences in toxicity between the
   isomers. Therefore, in this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to
   different concentrations of the penconazole enantiomer to study the
   developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of penconazole on zebrafish and
   the difference in toxicity between enantiomers. The results showed that
   penconazole exposure caused adverse effects on zebrafish embryos, such
   as autonomous motor abnormalities, heart rate slowing, and increased
   deformity, resulting in significant developmental toxicity. Meanwhile,
   also caused the zebra fish larvae to slow movement, the neurotransmitter
   content and nervous system related gene expression significantly
   changed, which proved that penconazole also caused neurotoxicity to
   zebrafish. Interestingly, our results also clearly show that
   (+)-penconazole is significantly more toxic to zebrafish than
   (-)-penconazole at the same concentration, whether it is developmental
   toxicity or neurotoxicity, which suggests that we should focus on
   (+)-penconazole more when conducting toxicological studies on
   penconazole. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Assessment of pesticides toxicity using zebrafish early life stages is
   relevant for aquatic systems safety. This study aimed to evaluate the
   short-term effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos from 3 h post fertilization to 96 hpf. A
   set of 2,4-D concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 80 mg/L were tested and
   median lethal concentration (LC50) at 96-h was calculated as 2.86 mg/L.
   A sub-teratogenic concentrations range from 0.02 to 0.8 mg/L was then
   used to assess effects at ontogenic, biochemical, and behavioral levels.
   The main developmental defects were tail deformities and pericardial
   edema at concentrations equal or above 0.32 mg/L. Cholinesterase
   activity (at 96 hpf) and larvae swimming behavior (at 120 hpf) were
   affected even at the lowest tested dose (0.02 mg/L). The behavior
   analysis was a sensitive endpoint, with a decrease in the swimming
   distance of exposed larvae during light period. The effect of 2,4-D in
   ChE was translated by an inhibition of the enzyme activity in all
   treated groups. These findings demonstrate that 2,4-D can alter the
   cholinergic system by affecting ChE activity which may be involved in
   the locomotion reduction of exposed larvae and emphasize the potential
   of neurotransmission and behavioral endpoints as early warning signs of
   herbicides contamination in aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Paraquat affects mitochondria' bioenergetics, dopamine system

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {191},
Pages = {106-117},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The dipyridyl herbicide paraquat induces oxidative stress in cells and
   is implicated in adult neurodegenerative diseases. However, less is
   known about paraquat toxicity in early stages of vertebrate development.
   To address this gap, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1,
   10 and 100 mu M paraquat for 96 h. Paraquat did not induce significant
   mortality nor deformity in embryos and larvae, but it did accelerate
   time to hatch. To evaluate whether mitochondrial respiration was related
   to earlier hatch times, oxygen consumption rate was measured in whole
   embryos. Maximal respiration of embryos exposed to 100 mu M paraquat for
   24 h was reduced by more than 70\%, suggesting that paraquat negatively
   impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics in early development. Based upon
   this evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional responses
   of oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes were measured. Fish
   exposed to 1 mu M paraquat showed higher expression levels of superoxide
   dismutase 2, heat shock protein 70, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and
   B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2a compared to control fish. No differences among
   groups were detected in larvae exposed to 10 and 100 mu M paraquat,
   suggesting a non-monotonic response. We also measured endpoints related
   to larval behavior and dopaminergic signaling as paraquat is associated
   with degeneration of dopamine neurons. Locomotor activity was stimulated
   with 100 mu M paraquat and dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor 3
   mRNA levels were increased in larvae exposed to 1 mu M paraquat,
   interpreted to be a compensatory response at lower concentrations. This
   study improves mechanistic understanding into the toxic actions of
   paraquat on early developmental stages. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Developmental toxicity in embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed
   to strobilurin fungicides (azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin are broad spectrum strobilurin
   fungicides that have been measured in the aquatic environment.
   Strobilurins inhibit mitochondrial respiration by binding to the
   mitochondrial respiratory complex Ill. The goal of this study was to
   investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the
   developing zebrafish from exposure to azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin.
   Exposure studies were performed where zebrafish embryos were exposed to
   azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin at 0.1, 10, 100 mu g/L from 4 hpf to 48
   hpf to measure mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress mRNA
   transcripts, and 5 dpf to measure movement, growth, oxygen consumption,
   enzymatic activities, and mRNA transcripts. Results from this study
   indicated that there was a significant reduction in both basal and
   maximal respiration at 48 hpf in zebrafish exposed to 100 mu g/L of
   pyraclostrobin. There was no difference in oxidative stress or apoptotic
   mRNA transcripts at 48 hpf, indicating that the two strobilurins were
   acting first on mitochondrial function and not directly through
   oxidative stress. At 5 dpf, standard body length was significantly
   reduced with exposure to pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin exposure as
   compared to the control. These reductions in apical endpoints
   corresponded with increases in oxidative stress and apoptotic mRNA
   transcripts in treatment groups at 5 dpf indicating that strobilurins'
   exposure followed the adverse outcome pathway for mito-toxicants. Our
   results indicate that strobilurins can decrease mitochondrial function,
   which in turn lead to diminished growth and movement. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {Worldwide, pesticides have contaminated the environment, affecting
   non-target species. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of
   fosetyl-Al (FOS) on model organisms. Based on the 3 Rs for animal
   research and described guidelines, the OECD 236 and 220 were applied
   with some modifications. The FOS test concentrations were
   0.02-0.2-2-20-200 mg/L for Danio rerio and 250-500-750-1000-1250 mg/kg
   for Enchytraeus crypticus. Besides the standard endpoints, additional
   endpoints were evaluated (D. rerio: behavior and biochemical responses;
   E. crypticus: extension of exposure duration (28 d (days) + 28 d) and
   organisms' sizes). For D. rerio, after 96 h (h), hatching was inhibited
   (200 mg/L), proteins' content increased (2 and 20 mg/L), lipids' content
   decreased (2 mg/L), glutathione S-transferase activity increased (2
   mg/L), and, after 120 h, larvae distance swam increased (20 mg/L). For
   E. crypticus, after 28 d, almost all the tested concentrations enlarged
   the organisms' sizes and, after 56 d, 1250 mg/kg decreased the
   reproduction. In general, alterations in the organisms' biochemical
   responses, behavior, and growth occurred at lower concentrations than
   the effects observed at the standard endpoints. This ecotoxicological
   assessment showed that FOS may not be considered safe for the tested
   species, only at higher concentrations than the predicted environmental
   concentrations (PECs). This research highlighted the importance of a
   multi-endpoint approach to assess the (eco)toxic effects of the

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {211},
Pages = {252-258},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Field residue of fipronil can interfere with the physiological
   characters of the domesticated fish; thus, lethal dose test and the
   general biomarker cannot delineate the low-level situation. Manipulating
   by video track, we observed an anxiety-like behavior including high
   speed and abnormal photoperiod accommodation after exposure to fipronil
   at environmental typical dose in zebrafish larvae. Examining the
   unbiased metabolomic profiles, we found perturbation in several
   metabolic pathways, including the increased contents of fatty acids and
   glycerol and the decreased levels of the glycine, serine, and branched
   amino acid. We presumed that observed enhanced fatty acid utility was in
   response to increase energy demands caused by anxiety like behavior.
   Additionally, the body burden of neurotransmitter such as glycine and
   L-glutamate may concurrently stimulate the swimming behavior. The
   insight of this study showed that integral perturbation such as
   metabolism helps us to further understand the risk to aquatic fish at
   the environmentally relevant levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl-dimethylphosphate), an organophosphorus
   pesticide used for indoor insect and livestock parasite control, is
   among the most common commercially available pesticides, However, there
   are significant concerns over its toxicity, especially due to its
   relative stability in water, soil, and air. Zebrafish, an important
   developmental model, has been used for studying the effects of toxic
   compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to
   dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days
   postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during
   the development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization),
   locomotor and social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days
   postfertilization). Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the
   body length and heartbeat rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as
   well as the surface area of the eyes (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance
   behavior test showed a significant decrease in escape responses at 7 (1,
   5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish. The evaluation of
   larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance traveled,
   mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between control
   and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult
   animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed
   remained reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L),
   recovering values similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior
   of zebrafish was not altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early
   stages of development. Thus, the exposure to organophosphorus compounds
   at early stages of development induces an increased susceptibility to
   behavioral and neuronal changes that could be associated with several
   neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl-glycine) (GLY) is the active ingredient of
   the most used herbicides in the world. GLY is applied in formulated
   products known as glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), which could induce
   effects that are not predicted by toxicity assays with pure GLY. This
   herbicide is classified as organophosphorus compound, which is known to
   induce neurotoxic effects. Although this compound is classified as
   non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies, acute exposure to GBH causes
   neurological symptoms in humans. However, there is no consensus in
   relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH. Thus, the aim of this study was
   to investigate the neurotoxic effects of the GBH in the zebrafish Danio
   rerio, focusing on acute toxicity, the activity and transcript levels of
   mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane
   potential, reactive species (RS) formation, and behavioral repertoire.
   Adult zebrafish were exposed in vivo to three concentrations of GBH
   Scout (R), which contained GLY in formulation (fGLY) (0.065,1.0 and 10.0
   mg L-1 fGLY) for 7 d, and an in vitro assay was performed using also
   pure GLY. Our results show that GBH induced in zebrafish brain a
   decrease in cell viability, inhibited mitochondrial complex enzymatic
   activity, modulated gene expression related to mitochondrial complexes,
   induced an increase in RS production, promoted hyperpolarization of
   mitochondrial membrane, and induced behavioral impairments. Together,
   our data contributes to the knowledge of the neurotoxic effects of GBH.
   Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a relevant cellular
   response that should not be disregarded. Moreover, this study pointed to
   the mitochondria as an important target of GBH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of a commercial
   herbicide extensively used in sugarcane cultivation, composed of diuron,
   hexazinone and inert ingredients using Danio rerio as test organism.
   Laboratory tests were performed according to the recommendations of the
   ABNT 15088 (2004) and USEPA (2002) standards. The water control
   parameters were pH, total water hardness, electrical conductivity,
   dissolved oxygen and temperature, swimming activity and mortality of the
   test organism. The lethal concentration (LC50) of the commercial
   herbicide for Danio rerio was of 581.50mg.L-1. Significant behavioral
   changes were observed at concentrations starting from 50 mg.L-1 of the
   commercial herbicide, causing hypoactivity of swimming movements in over
   50\% of the test organisms. To evaluate the toxicity of the inert
   ingredients, which account for 40\% p/p of the herbicide's composition,
   the compounds hexazinone and diuron were tested separately. At the
   studied concentrations, hexazinone and diuron did not cause mortality or
   altered swimming movements. It was concluded that the inert ingredients
   in the composition of the commercial herbicide were the major cause for
   acute toxicity to Danio rerio.},

Abstract = {The assessment of early effects caused in biota by sublethal exposure to
   pesticide mixtures should enhance the realism in the ecological risk
   assessment for agricultural landscapes. This study aimed to evaluate
   sub-individual responses in fish, which can be linked with outcomes at
   higher levels of biological organization and affect their trophic
   relationships. A multilevel biomarker approach was applied to assess the
   effects of a 48 h exposure of two freshwater mesoamerican fish species
   (Parachromis dovii and Poecilia gillii) to a mixture of sublethal
   concentrations of chlorpyrifos (5 mu g/L) and difenoconazole (325 mu
   g/L). Transcriptomic induction of cyp1A and the activities of
   7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-distillase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) were measured as biotransformation-related biomarkers;
   cholinesterase activity (ChE) was assessed as a neumtoxicity biomarker;
   resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured as a physiological biomarker;
   and the movement of fish in a dark-light environment as a behavior
   biomarker. The exposure to the mixture had evident effects on P. gillii,
   with significant induction of cyp1A transcription, increased EROD
   activity, ChE inhibition in muscle, and increased permanence in the
   light side of the dark-light environment. Meanwhile, P. dovii only
   showed significant induction of cyp1A, without evidence of neurotoxicity
   or changes in behavior. This study demonstrates that the severity of the
   effects caused by the exposure to a mixture of pesticides can differ
   among species from the same trophic chain. The potential impairment of
   predator-prey relationships is a relevant effect that pesticide
   pollution can cause and it should be considered for the risk assessment
   of such contaminants.},

Abstract = {Thiamethoxam is a commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide that acts as a
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. Although vertebrates
   are less sensitive to neonicotinoid insecticides than invertebrates,
   some neonicotinoids have been shown to cause neurobehavioral changes in
   larval fishes. In the present study, we examine the neurobehavioral
   toxicity of acute and chronic exposure to environmentally relevant
   concentrations of thiamethoxam in fathead minnows at two different life
   stages. Whereas acute exposure of embryos to thiamethoxam does not
   appear to stimulate spontaneous contractions within 1 min, chronic
   exposure of embryos to 1.57 mu g or more thiamethoxam/L caused increased
   mortality as well as a subtle increase in spontaneous contraction
   frequency (SCF), which was negatively correlated with early hatching
   success. Chronic exposure of embryos to 155 mu g thiamethoxam/L impaired
   predator escape response, and chronic exposure to 0.02-14.61 mu g
   thiamethoxam/L impaired foraging efficiency of some fish. Fathead
   minnows exposed to thiamethoxam beginning post hatch did not experience
   changes to measured health or neurobehavioral indicators. Taken
   together, our findings indicate that embryonic life stages are more
   sensitive to thiamethoxam exposure than later larval life stages.
   Because early exposure to thiamethoxam can cause deficits in predatory
   escape behaviors and may impair foraging success, further study of the
   potential direct and nondirect impacts of thiamethoxam on wild fish
   populations is warranted. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;00:1-10. (c) 2022

Abstract = {Pesticides contribute to human welfare by reducing vector-borne diseases
   and protecting crops against pests. Insecticides are the most widely
   employed pesticides for agricultural, domestic, and industrial pest
   control. However, some insecticides such as synthetic pyrethroids,
   analogs of the natural pyrethrin, persist in the environment and result
   in different hostile effects on nontarget organisms. Due to a continuous
   increase in the use of pyrethroids and their widespread application,
   different generations and types of pyrethroids have been frequently
   reported from environmental media, biota, and residential areas.
   Synthetic pyrethroids are observed to be less toxic to mammal and birds,
   relatively toxic to amphibians, and highly toxic to aquatic organisms
   including fish. Here, we review the occurrence, fate, biotransformation,
   and bioavailability of pyrethroids in waters. We also present biomarkers
   used to evidence toxicological effects of pyrethroids on fish. Toxic
   effects include oxidative stress and damage such as production of
   reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation; neurological behavioral
   inconsistencies; developmental effects such as delayed development and
   signaling; biochemical alterations of protein, glucose, and enzymes;
   hematological changes in white blood cells, red blood cells, and
   hemoglobin; physiological effects on metabolism and heart function;
   histopathological changes in the brain, liver, and gills; molecular
   toxicity including DNA damage, micronuclei induction, and altered gene
   or mRNA expression; and reproductive or endocrine disruption, e.g.,
   disrupted pathways and signaling. Mechanisms of toxicity and control

Abstract = {Thifluzamide is widely used fungicide and frequently detected in aquatic
   system. In this study, the toxicity of fungicide thifluzamide to
   non-targeted aquatic organisms was investigated for neuroendocrine
   disruption potentials. Here, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a series
   of concentrations of thifluzamide for 6 days. The results showed that
   both the development of embryos/larvae and the behavior of hatched
   larvae were significantly affected by thifluzamide. Importantly, the
   decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and the increased
   contents of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) and
   norepinephrine (NE), along with transcriptional changes of nervous
   system related genes were observed following 4 days exposure to
   thifluzamide. Besides, the decreased contents of triiodothyronine (T3)
   and thyroxine (T4) in whole body, as well as significant expression
   alteration in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis associated genes
   were discovered in zebrafish embryos after 4 days of exposure to
   thifluzamide. Our results clearly demonstrated that zebrafish embryos
   exposed to thifluzamide could disrupt neuroendocrine, compromise

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to compare the biological responses in
   developing zebrafish to two organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyrifos
   (CPF) and diazinon (DZN). Zebrafish embryos were exposed to either
   solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and
   25.0 mu M CPF, as well as one dose of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 mu M DZN
   for 96 h. CPF at 10.0 and 25.0 mu M caused 70-80\% and 100\% mortality
   in embryos after 96 h exposure, whereas embryos treated with 10.0 and
   100.0 04 DZN showed 30-40\% and 70-80\% lethality. CPF at 10.0 mu M
   significantly decreased cumulative hatching rate, whereas hatching rate
   was significantly reduced in embryos treated with 100.0 mu M DZN. Spinal
   lordosis was primarily observed in larvae exposed to 1.0 and 10.0 mu M
   CPF, whereas pericardial edema was mainly detected with 10.0 and 100.0
   mu M DZN exposure. Embryo exposed to 1.0, 10.0 and 25.0 mu M CPF
   exhibited no mitochondrial dysfunction; exposure to 100.0 mu M DZN
   significantly inhibited mitochondrial bioenergetics. To determine if CPF
   and DZN affected larval activity, dark photokinesis response was
   assessed in larvae following 7 days exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 mu M CPF, as
   well as to 0.1 1.0, and 10.0 mu M DZN. Larvae exposed to 1.0 mu M CPF
   showed hypoactivity, whereas the activity in the dark was not overtly
   changed in larvae exposed to DZN. In summary, CPF showed higher
   developmental toxicity compared to DZN. Moreover, based on the types of
   morphological deformities noted, as well as differences in locomotor
   activity, we conclude that OPs have unique chemical-specific modes of
   action that can result in varied biological responses during early
   development.},

Abstract = {To study the effects of endosulfan, a mild estrogen-mimic, on survival,

   hatchlings were discretely immersed at selected doses (44-1400 ng/l) for

   frequency of `juveniles' increased from 17\% at 44 ng/l to 44 \% at 1400

   suppression increased in the order of female > male > juveniles. During
   the 240-day experiment, it also postponed sexual maturity in females
   from the 120th dph (day post-hatching) in the control to the 181st dph

   processes of maturation of eggs and vitellogenesis. In the treated but
   persisting males, it postponed sexual maturity (120-129th dph) and

Abstract = {Endosulfan (ES) modifies the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibers
   and causes changes to the swimming behavior of fish. The objectives of
   the present work were to evaluate, in fishes of Australoheros facetus,
   1) the integrity of myofibrils (Mf) by the analysis of SDS-PAGE
   profiles, and 2) the functionality of Mf through the microscopically
   monitoring of the contraction and changes in Mg2+ Ca2+- ATPase and
   Mg2+(EGTA)-ATPase activities. As expected, after the addition of the
   contraction buffer, control fish Mf contracted. On the contrary, Mf from
   fish exposed at 0.5 mu g/L ES showed a partial contraction and none of
   the fish exposed at 10 mu g/L ES contracted. As judged by its high Mg2+
   Ca2+ ATPase activity and low Mg2+ (EGTA) ATPase activity, control Mf
   showed good functionality. In Mf from fish exposed to 0.5 and 10 mu g/L
   ES the activities of these enzymes were similar, suggesting denaturation
   or degradation of some component of tropomyosin troponin complex.
   SDS-PAGE patterns of Mf from fish exposed to ES showed degradation of
   the myosin heavy chain and of tropomyosin. Similar values of lipid
   peroxidation (TSARS) were found in both control and exposed Mf,
   suggesting that lipid oxidation was not be related to the
   above-mentioned changes. The observed effects expand the knowledge of ES
   action in muscles and could be used as biomarkers of damage in fishes
   exposed to organochlorine compounds like the insecticide endosulfan.},

Title = {Myclobutanil developmental toxicity, bioconcentration and sex specific
   response in cholesterol in zebrafish (Denio rerio)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The fungicide myclobutanil (MYC) is a common contaminant found in
   surface water. The aim of this study was to determine the acute
   toxicity, developmental effects, bioconcentration factor (BCF) and
   potential bio-molecular mechanisms of MYC toxicity in zebrafish.
   Susceptibility to MYC toxicity was life-stage dependent with adult fish
   being the most sensitive (96 h-LC50, 6.34 mg/L) followed by 72 h
   post-hatch (hph) larvae (8.90 mg/L), 12 hph larvae (20.53 mg/L) and
   embryos (42.54 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos and larvae (12 hph) responded
   with decreased hatching, heartbeat and growth, as well as abnormal
   spontaneous movement and development. BCFs were calculated by
   quantifying MYC concentrations from different tissues of adult zebrafish
   exposed to MYC for up to 11 days. Highest BCFs were obtained from gills
   (18.25 +/- 0.07), followed by viscera (16.78 +/- 0.04), head (13.13 +/-
   0.08) and muscle (8.96 +/- 0.10). MYC (0.5 mg/L) inhibited gene
   expression related to cholesterol synthesis pathway, including
   24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase
   (DHCR7), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCRa), HMGCRb,
   farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1(FDFT1), squa-lene epoxidase
   (SQLE), isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1) and CYP51,
   while no cholesterol changes were observed in the MYC treated group.
   These results will contribute to the literature assessing the
   environmental risk of MYC in aquatic environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Triadimefon (TDF) is a triazole fungicide extensively used in
   agriculture that has been found as a pollutant in numerous water
   sources. In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the
   dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine,
   resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a
   neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as
   locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we
   have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both
   larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the
   dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure
   of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L
   to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor
   activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of
   two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat).
   Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an
   anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production.
   On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent
   reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1
   (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists,
   respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes
   could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus,
   in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases
   locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the
   behaviors observed in mammals.},

Title = {Long-term exposure to cyprodinil causes abnormal zebrafish aggressive
   and antipredator behavior through the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal
   axis},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {241},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cyprodinil, one of the main pyrimidinamine fungicides, has been used to
   control fungal diseases in plants and vegetables worldwide. Previous
   studies have investigated the influences of cyprodinil on the
   developmental and reproductive toxicity of fish. However, it remains
   unknown whether it affects fish behaviors and the underlying mechanisms.
   In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model animal for behavioral
   studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to 240 days
   postfertilization at 0.1 mu g/L (environmentally relevant concentration)
   and 1, 10 mu g/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of
   zebrafish was significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 mu g/L
   cyprodinil and antipredator behavior was decreased after exposure.
   Cyprodinil exposure altered the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol
   levels, which regulate cortisol homeostasis and were significantly
   reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 mu g/L). In addition, most of the
   key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland axis, such as
   corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were
   downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent
   with the hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of
   apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil
   exposure groups. Moreover, these changes were potentially responsible
   for the increased aggression of zebrafish during the mirror-like
   aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator behavior during the
   predator avoidance test. Overall, the data provided herein further our
   understanding of cyprodinil toxicity and can be used to assess the
   ecological effects of cyprodinil on the induction of abnormal behaviors
   at the environmental level.},

Abstract = {Global use of azole fungicides is expected to increase over the next
   several years. Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that is used for
   turf protection, residential, and other commercial applications. As
   such, it can enter local rural and urban water systems via run-off and
   rain events. Early life stages of aquatic organisms can be susceptible
   to pesticides that enter the water, but in the case of triticonazole,
   data on the potential for subacute toxicity are lacking. Here, we
   determined the effects of triticonazole on development, oxygen
   consumption rates, and locomotor activity in zebrafish to address this
   knowledge gap. Wild-type zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were
   exposed to triticonazole (1-100 mu M) in early development for different
   lengths of time depending on the assay conducted. Triticonazole did not
   affect survival nor induce significant deformity (pericardial edema,
   skeletal defects) in zebrafish at doses up to 100 mu M. Oxygen
   consumption rate was measured in embryos after 24 and 48 hour exposure
   to triticonazole beginning at similar to 6 hpf using the XFe flux
   analyzer. Triticonazole did not affect basal respiration,
   oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration, FCCP-induced maximum
   respiration, proton leak, spare capacity, nor non-mitochondrial
   respiration at doses up to 100 mu M for 24 hours, even for exposure up
   to 250 mu M for 48 hours. To determine whether the fungicide affected
   larval swimming activity, the visual motor response test was conducted
   following triticonazole exposure for 6 days. Larval zebrafish exposed to
   triticonazole showed hypoactivity in the dark following a 100 mu M
   treatment, suggesting that the fungicide can affect the locomotor
   activity of zebrafish, albeit at relatively high levels. Given the fact
   that sublethal biological responses were absent at lower environmentally
   relevant concentrations, we conclude that triticonazole, relative to
   other triazole fungicides and types of pesticides, exhibits a relatively
   low risk of toxicity to the early life stages of fish.},

Title = {Detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals in Danio rerio and Daphnia
   pulex: Step-one, behavioral screen},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {271},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic surface and ground water contamination by chemicals is a
   global problem, and there is an urgent need to develop tools to identify
   and elucidate biological effects. Contaminants of emerging concern
   (CECs) are not typically monitored or regulated and those with known or
   suspected endocrine disrupting potential have been termed endocrine
   disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Many CECs are known to be neurotoxic (e.g.,
   insecticides) and many are incompletely characterized. Behavioral
   responses can identify chemicals with neuroactive properties, which can
   be relevant to EDC mechanisms (e.g., neuroendocrine disturbances). Two
   freshwater species, Daphnia pulex and Danio rerio, were evaluated for
   swimming behavior alterations resulting from 24-hr exposure to 9 CECs:
   triclosan, triclocarban, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, 4-nonylphenol,
   bisphenol-A, atrazine, metformin, and estrone. This is the first step in
   the development of a bioassay for detecting estrogenic and/or
   anti-androgenic activity with the goal to evaluate complex mixtures of
   uncharacterized contaminants in water samples. The second step,
   described in a subsequent report, examines transcriptome alterations
   following chemical exposure. Significant differences in the swimming
   behavior response and sensitivity were found across chemicals within a
   species and across species for a given chemical in this unique optical
   bioassay system. In the concentration ranges studied, significant
   behavioral alterations were detected for 6 of 9 CECs for D. pulex and 4
   of 9 CECs for D. rerio. These results underscore the utility of this
   bioassay to identify behavioral effects of sublethal concentrations of
   CECs before exploration of transcriptomic alterations for EDC detection.

Abstract = {Alterations of fish behavioral responses are sensitive indicators to
   identify accidental chemical pollution. In this research, a series of
   exposure tests were conducted to investigate behavioral changes of adult
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to deltamethrin (DM) in six
   concentrations of 0, 0.15, 1.5, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 g/L. Swimming changes
   in zebrafish were detected at a concentration as low as 1\% of the
   LC50-24h within five hours. Hyperactivity was the first response,
   followed by a second response of fish surfacing. The change patterns of
   swimming speed in zebrafish were similar in all exposure groups, but the
   degree increased with increasing concentrations. Swimming speed and
   depth were altered within the first two hours after exposure, which was
   regarded as the most vital phase for water quality monitoring. The
   duration of hyperactivity and the time of zebrafish surfacing were both
   logarithmically correlated with exposure concentrations, which was
   helpful to distinguish the level of pollution.},

Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate if vitamin E (alpha-TOC)
   modulates the developmental toxicity of the pesticide endosulfan (ESF),
   using a modified zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET). Zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) embryos were exposed from 6 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) to
   either ESF (0.1-50 mg/L) or alpha-TOC (0.01 3 mM) alone or in
   combination. The effects of these exposures on embryonic morphology,
   larval behavior and antioxidant gene expression were analyzed.
   Phenotypic analysis at 48 hpf showed that ESF led to a dose-dependent
   increase in embryonic deformities, including axis malformations,
   pericardial edema and reduced pigmentation. Co-exposure of ESF with
   a-TOC (1-3 mM) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ESF-induced embryonic
   malformations. Exposure to solely alpha-TOC did not affect rates of
   survival or malformations. Behavior studies showed that ESF caused
   hyperactivity at 5 days post fertilization, indicating a developmental
   neurotoxic effect. The ESF-induced hyperactivity was ameliorated by
   alpha-TOC. Elevated ESF concentrations caused down-regulation of the
   antioxidant genes cuzn-sod, gpxl a and cat, suggesting that ESF promoted
   oxidative stress in the embryos. alpha-TOC did not prevent the
   ESF-induced dysregulation of these genes. These results demonstrate that
   alpha-TOC protects against phenotypic and behavioral effects caused by
   ESF but did not rescue ESF-induced aberrations in antioxidant gene
   expression.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present study examined effects of the pesticide dichlorvos
   (O-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-O,O dimethylphosphate {[}DDVP]) on embryonic
   development of zebrafish. In a first set of experiments, early life
   stages of zebrafish were exposed to five concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50,
   and 100 mg/L(-1)) of DDVP for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). The
   24-hpf LC(50) value of DDVP in the semistatic test was 39.75 mg/L(-1).
   Developmental abnormalities have been observed in embryos and larvae,
   such as no blood flow, cardiac edema, delayed hatching, and vertebra
   malformations. Most of the onserved effects were increased in a
   concentration-dependent manner. To investigate the behavior of the
   larvae, zebrafish exposed to 10 and 25 mg/L(-1) DDVP were observed on
   days 6 and 9 after fertilization. 25 mg L(-1) DDVP dose caused
   significant slowing of swimming activity on day 6 and 9 after
   fertilization. According to present study results, DDVP exposure during
   early development caused (i) clear behavioral impairments detectable
   during the posthatching period and (ii) mortality and developmental
   abnormalities in zebrafish. Dichlorvos is present in the environment
   with other similar organophosphate compounds. Additive responses to
   organophosphate compounds may induce lethal or sublethal effects in
   early life stages of fish chronically exposed to this class of
   chemicals.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As a major neonicotinoid insecticide, thiacloprid (THCP) is frequently
   detected in aquatic environments worldwide due to its heavy use, posing
   potential threats to aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) embryos were exposed to THCP (1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 mu g/L)
   for 5 days and then recovered in THCP-free water for 20 days to
   investigate the effects of early-stage THCP exposure on the development,
   antioxidant defense, and neurotransmitter systems of zebrafish, and
   explore their recovery mechanism. The results show that THCP exposure
   induced developmental toxicity and oxidative stress in zebrafish. The
   hypoactivity, behavioral alterations (decreased avoidance and edge
   preference behaviors) and neurotoxicity were found throughout the
   exposure-recovery experiments. THCP exposure altered the expression of
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and serotonin (5-HT)-related genes
   accompanied by the decrease in GABA and 5-HT contents. However, after
   recovery, GABA content returned to the control level, but 5-HT did not,
   indicating that only the serotonergic system was persistently disrupted.
   Overall, our results suggest that the disruption of the serotonergic
   system and oxidative stress may aggravate neurotoxicity and that the
   former was the main reason for the depressive-like behavior. This study
   could help to unravel the mechanisms of the behavioral alterations
   induced by early-stage THCP exposure in zebrafish.},

Title = {Hepatic proteome network data in zebrafish (Danio rerio) liver following
   dieldrin exposure},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Dieldrin is an environmental contaminant that adversely affects aquatic
   organisms. The data presented in this study are proteomic data collected
   in liver of zebrafish that were exposed to the pesticide in a dietary
   exposure. For label free proteomics, data were collected with a
   quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer and for iTRAQ proteomics,
   data were acquired using a hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap (Q Exactive) MS
   system. Using formic acid digestion and label free proteomics, 2,061
   proteins were identified, and among those, 103 were differentially
   abundant (p < 0.05 in at least one dose). In addition, iTRAQ proteomics
   identified 722 proteins in the liver of zebrafish following dieldrin
   treatment. The label-free approach identified 21 proteins that followed
   a dose dependent response. Of the differentially abundant proteins
   identified by iTRAQ, there were 26 unique expression patterns for
   proteins based on the three doses of dieldrin. Proteins were queried for
   disease networks to learn more about adverse effects in the liver
   following dieldrin exposure. Differentially abundant proteins were
   related to metabolic disease, steatohepatitis and lipid metabolism
   disorders, drug-induced liver injury, neoplasms, tissue degeneration and
   liver metastasis. The proteomics data described here is associated with
   a research article, ``Label-free and iTRAQ proteomics analysis in the
   liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio) following a dietary exposure to the
   organochlorine pesticide dieldrin{''} (Simmons et al. 2019). This
   investigation reveals new biomarkers of toxicity and will be of interest

Title = {Chronic exposure to environmentally realistic levels of diuron impacts
   the behaviour of adult marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {238},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Diuron, a commonly used herbicide and antifouling biocide, has been
   frequently detected in seawater. The effects of diuron on fish behaviour
   are currently poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias
   melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels
   of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural
   evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron
   increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator
   avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression,
   social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However,
   only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the
   novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to
   diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and
   changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine
   synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused
   significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine
   hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the
   expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative
   expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly
   upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups. These
   findings highlight the significant neumtoxic effects of diumn and the
   extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain.
   More broadly, this study reveals the ecological risk associated with
   environmentally realistic levels of diuron in marine animals.},

Title = {Exposure and post-exposure effects of endosulfan on Bufo bufo tadpoles:

Abstract = {Endosulfan is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) that has lethal and
   sublethal effects on non-target organisms, including amphibians. In a
   laboratory study, we investigated direct and post-exposure effects of
   endosulfan on Bufo bufo tadpoles. For this purpose we exposed the
   tadpoles to a single short-term contamination event (96 h) at an
   environmentally-realistic concentration (200 mu g endosulfan/L). This
   was followed by a recovery period of 10 days when the experimental
   animals were kept in pesticide-free water. The endpoints were assessed
   in terms of mortality, incidence of deformity, effects on behavior, and
   the morpho-functional features of the epidermis. We found that a
   short-term exposure to the tested concentration of endosulfan did not
   cause mortality but induced severe sublethal effects, such as
   hyperactivity, convulsions, and axis malformations. Following relocation
   to a pesticide-free environment, we noted two types of response within
   the experimental sample, in terms of morphological and behavioral
   traits. Moreover, by using both ultrastructural and a morpho-functional
   approach, we found that a short-term exposure to endosulfan negatively
   affected the amphibian epidermis. We also observed several
   histo-pathological alterations: increased mucous secretion, an increase
   in intercellular spaces and extensive cell degeneration, together with
   the induction of an inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
   Following the post-exposure period, we found large areas of epidermis in
   which degeneration phenomena were moderate or absent, as well as a
   further increase in iNOS immunoreactivity. Thus, after 10 days in a
   free-pesticide environment, the larval epidermis was able to partially
   replace elements that had been compromised due to a physiological and/or
   a pathological response to the pesticide. These results highlight the
   need for both exposure and post-exposure experiments, when attempting to
   assess pollutant effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Molecular networks related to the immune system and mitochondria are
   targets for the pesticide dieldrin in the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
   central nervous system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS},

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and
   molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous
   system (CNS) following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin.
   Zebrafish were fed pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8 mu g/g
   dieldrin for 21 days. Behavioral analysis revealed no difference in
   exploratory behaviors or those related to anxiety. Transcriptional
   networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were decreased in
   expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,
   consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides.
   Processes related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially
   affected by dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid
   quadrupole-Orbitrap identified 226 proteins that were different
   following one or more doses. These proteins included ATP synthase
   subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 which were
   decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal recognition
   particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were
   functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network
   analysis implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as
   diseases associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to
   mitochondrial dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to
   underlie the association between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute
   to a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic biomarker framework for
   pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Biological significance: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine
   pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease
   such as Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S.
   Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a
   pesticide of concern for human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative
   proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed to characterize the molecular networks
   in the central nervous system that are altered with dietary exposure to
   dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and protein networks related to
   the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's disease were
   preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight into

Title = {Chronic bisphenol A exposure alters behaviors of zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {206},
Pages = {275-281},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to treated-effluent
   concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) for 6
   months to evaluate their effects on behavioral characteristics: motor
   behavior, aggression, group preference, novel tank test and light/dark
   preference. E2 exposure evidently dampened fish locomotor activity,
   while BPA exposure had no marked effect. Interestingly, BPA-exposed fish
   reduced their aggressive behavior compared with control or E2. Both BPA
   and E2 exposure induced a significant decrease in group preference, as
   well as a weaker adaptability to new environment, exhibiting lower
   latency to reach the top, more entries to the top, longer time spent in
   the top, fewer frequent freezing, and fewer erratic movements.
   Furthermore, the circadian rhythmicity of light/dark preference was
   altered by either BPA or E2 exposure. Our results suggest that chronic
   exposure of treated-effluent concentration BPA or E2 induced various
   behavioral anomalies in adult fish and enhanced ecological risk to
   wildlife. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing Anti-Social and Aggressive Behavior in a Zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) Model of Parkinson's Disease Chronically Exposed to Rotenone},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Rotenone (ROT) is currently being used in various research
   fields, especially neuroscience. Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT
   induces a Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the
   associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous
   system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing
   data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring
   novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different
   potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive
   behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer.
   Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 mu g/L,
   valproic acid (VPA)-0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg
   + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the
   anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every
   4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern
   in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB,
   and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating
   a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal
   intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four
   out of eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT
   + VPA-displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by
   long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central
   arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g)
   ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not
   significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except
   for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms
   of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited
   exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only
   near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001).
   Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement
   compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e-h).
   Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among
   the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while
   VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.},

   and their metabolites exhibited significant developmental toxicities,
   caused abnormal vascular development, and changed locomotor activities
   in larvae. The alteration of gene expression involved in the thyroid
   system and the innate immune system indicated that SPs and their three
   metabolites have the potency to induce thyroid disruption and trigger an

   metabolites could induce multiple toxic responses similar to parent
   compounds, and their toxicity should be considered for improving the

Abstract = {Sevin brand carbaryl insecticide is one of the most commonly used

   were consistently smaller than the control starting at 24 h after
   spawning until hatching. Embryos in the highest concentration took up to
   twice as long to hatch as the control. This delayed hatching time
   increases vulnerability to predation. In addition, as minnows are lower
   on the food chain, bioaccumulation of Sevin in tissues may increase in
   larger predators, affecting their metabolism and reproduction. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Toxicological studies of O-ethyl-O-(4-nitrophenyl)
   phenylphosphonothioate (EPN) to aquatic vertebrates have been reported,
   but no reports on toxic mechanism was reported. As zebrafish (Danio

   at the highest treated concentration of 500 mu g/L. In both 250 mu g/L
   and 500 mu g/L, edemas were observed in the heart and yolk sac, and a
   blood pool was also found. Acridine orange staining confirmed apoptotic
   phynotype, which was the strongest in embryos at 48 hpf. No noticeable
   difference in the formation and the shape of blood vessels of
   Tg(fli1a:EGFP) was observed. However, the total body length and number
   of somite were decreased. Heart formation in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) were not
   properly proceeded, and the ventricle did not beat normally at 500 mu
   g/L level. Cardiac development-related genes, myl7 and nppa, were
   significantly down- and up-regulated in a concentration-dependent
   manner. The slowed heartbeat was confirmed using Tg(gata1:EGFP), showing
   stagnant blood flow and seizure-like events were observed. Altogether,
   EPN can be the cause for the abnormal heart development accompanied by
   blood stagnation in embryos, interfering normal development with their
   inner circulatory system.},

Abstract = {Fish in agricultural and remote areas may be exposed to endosulfan and
   its degradation products as a result of direct runoff, atmospheric
   transport and deposition. The following study used the zebrafish
   developmental model to investigate the responses to endosulfan I and
   endosulfan sulfate, the major degradation product of endosulfan I and
   II. Embryos were dechorionated and waterborne exposed to the endosulfan
   I or endosulfan sulfate from 6 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf).
   Endosulfan I exposure concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 10 mu g/L and
   endosulfan sulfate from 1 to 100 mu g/L. Water solutions were renewed
   every 24 h and fish were scored for overt developmental and behavioral
   abnormalities. Chemical analysis was performed on water, whole embryo,
   and larvae samples to determine waterborne exposure concentrations and
   tissue concentrations throughout the 5-day period. The most sensitive
   toxicity end-point for both endosulfan I and endosulfan sulfate was an
   abnormal response of the embryo/larvae to touch, suggesting that
   endosulfan I and sulfate are developmentally neurotoxic. The waterborne
   exposure EC(50)s for inhibition of touch response for endosulfan I and
   endosulfan sulfate were 2.2 mu g/L and 23 mu g/L, respectively. The
   endosulfans were highly concentrated by the organisms, and the
   inhibition of touch response tissue EC50, determined from the measured
   tissue concentrations, was 367 ng/g for endosulfan I and 4552 ng/g for
   endosulfan sulfate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessment of fipronil toxicity to the freshwater midge Chironomus
   riparius: Molecular, biochemical, and organismal responses},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {216},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that entered the market to
   replace organochlorides and organophosphates. Fipronil impairs the
   regular inhibition of nerve impulses that ultimately result in paralysis
   and death of insects. Because of its use as a pest control, and due to
   runoff events, fipronil has been detected in freshwater systems near
   agricultural areas, and therefore might represent a threat to non-target
   aquatic organisms. In this study, the toxicity of fipronil to the
   freshwater midge Chironomus riparius was investigated at biochemical,
   molecular, and whole organism (e.g. growth, emergence, and behavior)
   levels.
   At the individual level, chronic (28 days) exposure to fipronil resulted
   in reduced larval growth and emergence with a lowest observed effect
   concentration (LOEC) of 0.081 mu g L-1. Adult weight, which is directly
   linked to the flying performance and fecundity of midges, was also
   affected (LOEC = 0.040 mu g L-1). Additionally, behavioral changes such
   as irregular burrowing behavior of C. riparius larvae (EC50 = 0.084 mu g
   L-1) and impairment of adult flying performance were observed. At a
   biochemical level, acute (48 h) exposure to fipronil increased cellular
   oxygen consumption (as indicated by the increase of electron transport
   system (ETS) activity) and decreased antioxidant and detoxification
   defenses (as suggested by the decrease in catalase (CAT) and glutathione
   S-transferase (GST) activities). Exposure to fipronil also caused
   alterations in the fatty acid profile of C. riparius, since high levels
   of stearidonic acid (SDA) were observed. A comparison between exposed
   and non-exposed larvae also revealed alterations in the expression of
   globins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and proteins involved in
   protein biosynthesis. These alterations may aid in the interpretation of
   potential mechanisms of action that lead to the effects observed at the
   organism level.
   Present results show that environmentally relevant concentrations of
   fipronil are toxic to chironomid populations which call for monitoring
   of phenylpyrazole insecticides and of their ecological effects in
   freshwaters. Present results also emphasize the importance of
   complementing ecotoxicological data with molecular approaches such as
   proteomics, for a better interpretation of the mode of action of
   insecticides in aquatic invertebrates.},

Abstract = {Neonicotinoids are widely used insecticides that have frequently been
   found in freshwater with concentrations ranging from ng to mu g/L. It is
   known that these compounds impact non-target invertebrates, such as bees
   and gammaridae, in terms of toxicity and behavior, but impacts and
   species differences on vertebrates such as fish are little explored. The
   aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of one
   widely used neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on development and behavior of
   two fish model species: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka
   (Oryzias latipes). Fish were exposed for 5 (zebrafish) and 14 (medaka)
   days from 0.2 to 2000 mu g/L. imidacloprid by aqueous exposure.
   Survival, development, behavior and histological features were monitored
   and organism-internal concentrations and biotransformation products
   measured. Imidacloprid caused sublethal effects in both species but the
   effects were much stronger in medaka with deformities, lesions and
   reduced growth being the most prominent impacts. Due to the overall
   longer time of development, time-integrated exposure of medaka was about
   2-fold higher compared to zebrafish, potentially accounting for parts of
   the sensitivity differences. Our results underline the importance of
   taking species sensitivity differences into account especially when
   considering that medaka responded at imidacloprid concentrations that
   have been measured in the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The maternal transfer and developmental toxicity of chiral contaminants
   with respect to enantioselectivity have rarely been investigated. Here,
   the residues and toxicological responses of cis-BF, a typical chiral
   pesticide, were studied in the progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to
   cis-BF (0, 20, 100, and 500 ng/L) for 60 days. Cis-BF enantiomers
   exhibited the equal maternal transfer potentials. GC/MSD analysis showed
   that parental 1S-cis-BF exposure could disrupt the components of fatty
   acids in offspring embryos. In transcriptional expression, the whole
   differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in GO
   categories, including the processes related to lipid
   biosynthesis/metabolism. The perturbations of fatty acids suggested that
   cis-BF has potential negative impacts on embryos' development.
   Furthermore, enantioselective growth inhibition and developmental
   neurotoxicity in larvae were also observed. The mRNA expressions of
   neuronal development genes were significantly changed in 1S-exposed
   offspring, so were the levels of the neurotransmitters and larval
   locomotion. Our results show that the cis-BF induced the growth
   inhibition and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae, which may be mediated
   by the development interference in embryos related to the disrupted
   fatty acid composition. Furthermore, the toxicological response to
   1S-cis-BF was greater than that to the 1R-enantiomer in the offspring of
   exposed adults.},

Abstract = {An effective biological early warning system for the detection of water
   contamination should employ undemanding species that rapidly react to
   the presence of contaminants in their environment The demonstrated
   reaction should be comprehensible and unambiguously evidential of the
   contamination event. This study utilized 96 h post fertilization
   zebrafish larvae and tested their behavioral response to acute exposure
   to low concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) (5.0, 2.5,125, 0.625
   mg/L) and permethrin (0.05, 0.029, 0.017, 0.01 mu g/L). We hypothesize
   that the number of larvae that show advanced trajectories in a group
   corresponds with water contamination, as the latter triggers avoidance
   behavior in the organisms. The proportion of advanced trajectories in
   the control and treated groups during the first minute of darkness was
   designated as a segregation parameter. It was parametrized and a
   threshold value was set using one CdCl2 trial and then applied to the
   remaining CdCl2 and permethrin replicates. For all cases, the method
   allowed distinguishing between the control and treated groups within two
   cycles of light: dark. The calculated parameter was statistically
   significantly different between the treated and control groups, except
   for the lowest CdCl2 concentration (0.625 mg/L) in one replicate. This
   proof of-concept study shows the potential of the proposed methodology

Abstract = {In order to assess the combined toxicity of environmental chemicals with
   different modes of action in acute (2 h) and subchronic (11 d)
   exposures, embryos and larvae of Danio rerio were exposed to a heavy
   metal salt, nickel chloride (NiCl(2)) the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CHP)
   and their binary mixtures. Chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholine esterase
   inhibitor, which is likely to affect behaviour of the organism. NiCl(2)
   targets the active sites of enzymes and is regarded as an unspecific
   toxicant for aquatic organisms. Several endpoints, such as locomotor
   activity, morphological abnormalities, and mortality of D. rerio embryos
   and larvae were studied. During acute exposures to >= 0.25 mg/L of
   chlorpyrifos, locomotor activity tended to increase. However, this
   activity decreased significantly at >= 7.5 mg Ni/L. Subchronic exposures
   to CHP resulted in behavioural changes at much lower concentrations (>=
   0.01 mg/L) and considerably earlier than the observed increase in
   morphological abnormalities and mortality (LC(50) (10 d): 0.43 mg/L).
   Combined CHP and NiCl(2) Mixtures led to an antagonistic deviation from
   the concept of independent action, in the case of locomotor activity.
   Compared to developmental or survival parameters, behaviour was the most
   sensitive endpoint for CHP exposure in this study; therefore we
   recommend this parameter to complement already established endpoints.

Abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ), a commonly used pesticide linked to endocrine
   disruption, cancer, and altered neurochemistry, frequently contaminates
   water sources at levels above the US Environmental Protection Agency's 3
   parts per billion (ppb; mu g/L) maximum contaminant level. Adult male
   zebrafish behavior, brain transcriptome, brain methylation status, and
   neuropathology were examined to test the hypothesis that embryonic ATZ
   exposure causes delayed neurotoxicity, according to the developmental
   origins of health and disease paradigm. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
   were exposed to 0 ppb, 0.3 ppb, 3 ppb, or 30 ppb ATZ during
   embryogenesis (1-72 h post fertilization (hpf)), then rinsed and raised
   to maturity. At 9 months post fertilization (mpf), males had decreased
   locomotor parameters during a battery of behavioral tests.
   Transcriptomic analysis identified altered gene expression in organismal
   development, cancer, and nervous and reproductive system development and
   function pathways and networks. The brain was evaluated
   histopathologically for morphometric differences, and decreased numbers
   of cells were identified in raphe populations. Global methylation levels
   were evaluated at 12 mpf, and the body length, body weight, and brain
   weight were measured at 14 mpf to evaluate effects of ATZ on mature
   brain size. No significant difference in genome methylation or brain
   size was observed. The results demonstrate that developmental exposure
   to ATZ does affect neurodevelopment and neural function in adult male
   zebrafish and raises concern for possible health effects in humans due
   to ATZ's environmental presence and persistence.},

Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Organophosphate (OP) compounds comprise one of the most widely used
   classes of insecticides worldwide. OPs have been shown to have negative
   human health impacts, particularly developmental neurotoxicity. However,
   neurotoxic impacts in later adulthood and during the aging process are
   relatively uncharacterized. The present study examined diazinon (DZN),
   an OP, to determine the neurobehavioral consequences, in addition to
   mitochondrial dysfunction on a macroscale (whole organism basal
   respiration) and on a microscale (whole organ mitochondrial
   respiration), using zebrafish (ZF) as a model. One group of 14-month-old
   adult ZF were exposed acutely as adults (0.4, 1.25, and 4.0 mu M) for
   five days and tested as adults, and another group was exposed
   developmentally 5-120 h post-fertilization (70, 210, and 700 nM) and
   tested at larval, adolescent, adult, and aging life stages. ZF exposed
   acutely as adults did not display many significant neurobehavioral
   impacts or mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the embryonically
   exposed ZF showed altered behavioral functions at each stage of life
   which emerged and attenuated as fish transitioned from each
   developmental stage to the next. Mitochondrial oxygen consumptions
   measurement results for developmentally DZN exposed ZF showed
   significant increases in the low and middle dose groups in organs such
   as the brain and testes. Overall, there is an indication that early
   developmental exposure to DZN had continuing adverse neurobehavioral and
   cellular consequences throughout their lives well into adulthood and
   aging periods.},

Abstract = {This study outlines the toxic effects of Quinalphos (QP), an
   organophosphrous insecticide on the development of zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) embryos, with special emphasis on toxicomorphomics and
   toxicokinetics of target enzyme, AChE. A range of concentrations was
   used to elucidate the median lethal concentration (LC50) of Quinalphos.
   Furthermore, embryos were exposed to two sub-lethal concentrations LC10
   (0.66 mg/L) and LC20 (1.12 mg/L) along with a median lethal
   concentration (3.0 mg/L) for 96 h. Several morphological aberrations
   like lordosis, kyphosis, scoliosis, heart edema, breaks in the neuronal
   tube and underdeveloped facial parts were noticed, which were of
   concentration and time dependent. The QP has adequately hindered
   hatching process during the course of exposure which was upheld by the
   in silico docking studies with hatching enzyme, ZHE1. The length of
   hatchlings at 96 h in LC50 concentration was significantly reduced to
   47\% compared to control. A significant pericardial effusion (5 to 16
   fold) was observed in >90\% of LC50 treated groups. Morphological
   changes in heart lead to the bradycardia, which ultimately leading to
   heart failure in some cases. The swimming behavior was significantly
   diminished in relation to the inhibition of AChE levels. From the in
   vitro kinetic studies, the kinetic constants Km, Vmax and inhibitory
   concentration K-i (4.45 x 10(-5) M) was determined which supported the
   competitive nature of QP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   alteration in zebrafish (Danio rerio){*}},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) is one of the first synthetic hormones and
   has been widely used in fruit cultivation, gardening and agriculture.
   However, excessive use of 6-BA will cause potential harm to the
   environment and humans. Therefore, our research focused on assessing the
   impact of 6-BA on the development and neurobehavior of zebrafish. The
   results showed that 6-BA had little effect on the embryos from 2 hpf to
   10 hpf. However, delayed development, decreased survival and
   hatchability were observed under 30 and 40 mg/L 6-BA from 24 hpf. 6-BA
   also reduced surface tension of embryonic chorions at 24 hpf. In
   addition, 6-BA caused abnormal morphology and promoted the accumulation
   of oxidative stress. Transcription of genes in connection with
   development and oxidative stress was also strikingly altered. Results of
   movement assay showed that zebrafish were less active and their behavior
   was significantly inhibited under the 20 and 30 mg/L 6-BA treatments.
   Locomotion-related genes th and mao were down-regulated by gradient,
   while the transcription of dbh was upregulated at a low concentration (2
   mg/L) but decreased as the concentration increased. Moreover, 6-BA
   exposure caused increased arousal and decreased sleep. Sleep/wake
   related genes hcrt and hcrtr2 were upregulated, but decreased at 30
   mg/L, while the mRNA level of aanat2 was reduced in a
   concentration-dependent manner. To sum up, our results showed that 6-BA
   induced developmental toxicity, promoted the accumulation of oxidative
   stress, and damaged locomotion and sleep/wake behavior.

Abstract = {The excessive levels of aquatic endocrine disruptors (EDs) and namely
   heavy metals plus xenoestrogens account for irregular gas exchange
   processes, reduced reproductive success, as well as abnormal social
   interactions of marine teleost fish. These effects at the encephalic
   level appear to derive from the interference of major signaling factors
   such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor subtypes (H1-4R). HA is one of the
   main biogenic amine neuronal system responsible for regulatory
   homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms and motor
   activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic
   effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how
   they are capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor
   subtypes. Interestingly, subtype 2 (H2R) proved to be a preferential
   target of heavy metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as
   displayed by its specific antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing
   non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et al., 2003, Pharmacol
   Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the preferential H3R
   antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfer with normal swimming
   behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent
   hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol
   227:248-256). In the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan,
   their actions tend to mostly account for feeding alterations through
   hypothalamic H3R-dependent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to
   highlight the type of ED-HAergic neuroreceptor variations that are
   involved in stressor-dependent neurobehavioral responses of commercially
   valuable marine teleosts.},

   pollution?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {In this research, the toxic effects of deltamethrin (DM) on the behavior
   responses of Zebra fish (Danio rerio) in the characteristic of behavior
   strength were investigated followed by an assessment of an in situ
   remediation of the DM pollution using sodium percarbonate. Behavior
   strength of Danio rerio was approximately 0.83 in the control group and
   was slightly higher than 0.83 in the sublethal treatment (0.1 TU (toxic
   unit)), which suggested that sublethal DM exposure could induce a
   stimulation effect in 48 h of exposure. In lower DM concentration
   treatments (0.5 and 1.0 TU), behavior strength could be inhibited
   significantly. Behavior responses of Danio rerio showed a gradually
   increased tendency when they were exposed to higher concentration of DM,
   and the declining amplitudes of behavior strength changed with the
   increase of DM concentrations. These results suggested that DM had
   evident acute toxicity effects on the behavior responses of Danio rerio
   with a good dose-effect relationship. The in situ remediation of the DM
   pollution using sodium percarbonate showed that the toxic effect of DM
   on behavior responses of Danio rerio could be eliminated even in the
   highest concentration of DM (5.0 TU). Meanwhile, the behavior response
   of Danio rerio in the treatment of sodium percarbonate was the same as
   in the control, which indicated that sodium percarbonate had no evident
   toxic effects on the behavior of Danio rerio in the current
   concentration. This study suggested that adding sodium percarbonate in
   situ might be a good way to eliminate the DM toxic effects. (C) Higher

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {698},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In natural environments, the aquatic organisms are exposed to complex
   mixtures of chemicals which may originate from natural sources or from
   anthropogenic activities. In this context, the aim of the study was to
   assess the potential effects that might occur when aquatic organisms are
   simultaneously exposed to multiple chemicals. For that, we have studied
   the acute effects of cadmium (0.2 mu g L-1), nickel (10 mu g L-1) and
   deltamethrin (2 mu g L-1) as individual toxicants and as mixture on the
   behavioral responses, oxidative stress (SOD and GPx), body electrolytes
   and trace metals profiles of zebrafish (Danio rerio). So far the
   scientific literature did not report about the combined effects of
   pesticides and toxic metals on zebrafish behavior using a 3D tracking
   system. Compared with other studies, in the present paper we
   investigated the acute effects of two heavy metals associated with a
   pesticide on zebrafish, in the range of environmentally relevant
   concentrations. Thus, the environmental concentrations of cadmium and
   nickel in three rivers affected by urban activities and one river with
   protected areas as background control were measured. The observations
   that resulted in our study demonstrated that del tamethrin toxicity was
   significantly decreased in some of the behavioral variables and
   oxidative stress when combined with Cd-Ni mixture. Consequently, our
   study supports previous works concerning the combined toxicity of
   environmental chemicals since their simultaneous presence in the aqueous
   environment may lead to higher or lower toxicological effects on biota
   than those reported from a single pollutant. Therefore, the evaluation
   of toxic effects of a single contaminant does not offer a realistic
   estimate of its impact against aqueous ecosystems This study also
   supports the idea that the interactions between different chemical
   compounds which do not exceed the maximum permitted limits in
   environment may have benefits for aquatic life forms or be more toxic.

Abstract = {The neurotoxic effects attributed to the pesticide fenvalerate (FEN) are
   well-established. The aim of this study was to determine whether
   melatonin (MLT) was able to protect against FEN-induced behavior,
   oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neurogenesis using zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) model. Zebrafish exposed to 100 mu g/L FEN for 120 h exhibited
   decreased swimming activity accompanied by downregulated expression of
   neurogenesis-related genes (Dlx2, Shha, Ngn1, Elavl3, and Gfap),
   suggesting that neurogenesis were impaired. In addition, FEN exposure
   significantly elevated oxidative stress as evidenced by increased
   malondialdehyde levels, as well as activities of Cu/Zn superoxide
   dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Acridine
   orange staining demonstrated that embryos treated with FEN for 120 h
   significantly enhanced apoptosis mainly in the brain. FEN also produced
   upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes (Bax, Fas,
   caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3) and decreased expression of the
   anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. MLT significantly attenuated the FEN-mediated
   oxidative stress, modulated apoptotic-regulating genes, and diminished
   apoptotic responses. Further, MLT blocked the FEN-induced effects on
   swimming behavior as well as on neurogenesis-related genes. In
   conclusion, MLT protected against FEN-induced developmental
   neurotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibiting pesticide-mediated oxidative
   stress in zebrafish.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate is the active ingredient of some of the most highly produced
   and used herbicides worldwide. The intensive applications of
   glyphosate-based herbicides and its half-life in water lead to its
   presence in many aquatic ecosystems. Whereas recent studies have
   reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including autism related
   effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L) concentrations,
   so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant
   concentrations of this compound (ng/L to mu g/L) can induce
   neurotoxicity. In this study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate
   in adult zebrafish after waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant
   concentrations (0.3 and 3 mu g/L) for two weeks. Our data showed that
   exposed fish presented a significant impairment of exploratory and
   social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety. The anterior brain
   of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in dopamine and
   serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic
   acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes
   involved in the dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was
   downregulated. Finally, the brain of exposed fish presented a
   significant increase in the catalase and superoxide dismutase
   activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione stores. These
   changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the
   observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the
   levels of lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show
   that current glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic
   ecosystems may have detrimental consequences on fish survival by
   decreasing exploration of the environment or altering social
   interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a vertebrate model
   widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are relevant
   not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding
   the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.},

Abstract = {Pesticides reach water bodies through different routes, either owing to
   incorrect packaging disposal, direct application to control macrophytes,
   leaching from fields, or natural degradation processes. In the aquatic
   environment, adverse effects in non-target species that come in contact
   with these substances are poorly understood. Currently, the most used
   pesticides are glyphosate (GBH) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-based
   herbicides (DBH), as its presence in water bodies is already known, we
   used environmental concentrations and our exposure time comprised the
   entire period of organogenesis (3-120 h post-fertilization). We
   evaluated the response of embryos in their early development with the
   parameters of mortality, hatching, spontaneous movement, and heart rate;
   and it's through behavior the open field test and aversive stimulus, as
   well as biochemical analyzes of acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE),
   catalase (CTL) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as a possible mechanism of
   action. Exposure to GBH decreased survival, caused hypermobility and
   anxiolytic behavior, negatively affected the anti-predatory behavior of
   the larvae, and increases acetylcholinesterase activity, whereas
   exposure to DBH caused only slight hypermobility in the larvae and
   increases acetylcholinesterase activity. These changes may compromise
   the perpetuation of the species, the search for partners/food, and
   facilitate the action of predators, which can result in serious
   ecological consequences.},

Title = {Mortality, Spatial Avoidance and Swimming Behavior of Bullfrog Tadpoles
   (Lithobates catesbeianus) Exposed to the Herbicide Diuron},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Diuron is a widely used pesticide for weed control in Brazil, Australia,
   the USA, and EU; therefore, environmental consequences are of concern.
   The aim of the present study was to determine the potential toxic
   effects of diuron (as formulation Diuron Nortox (R) 500 SC) on tadpoles
   of the bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus, considering three endpoints:
   lethality, swimming behavior, and avoidance (ability to escape from
   contaminant). Secondly, it was intended to compare the sensitivity of
   tadpoles with to fish and other amphibian species by applying species
   sensitive distribution (SSD). Five diuron concentrations (20, 30, 35,
   40, and 45mg a.i./L) were tested in triplicate to evaluate mortality,
   swimming speed, and distance traveled after 96h of exposure to the
   herbicide. Two avoidance tests were conducted using a multicompartmented
   system (n=6) containing three tadpoles per compartment. Dilution
   gradients were established at 0; 5; 25; 50; 75; and 100\% for both
   systems, corresponding to 0; 0.5; 2.5; 5; 7.5; and 10mg a.i./L in an
   experiment, taking into account the results of the acute toxicity test
   and 0; 5; 25; 50; 100; and 150g a.i./L for another experiment,
   considering reported environmentally relevant concentrations in
   Brazilian water bodies. The acute toxicity tests (n=3) with diuron
   revealed an 96h-LC50 of 31 +/- 3.7mg a.i./L. The decreased maximum speed
   was only observed in tadpoles exposed to 30mg a.i./L (0.15 +/- 0.04m/s)
   when compared to the control (0.28 +/- 0.06m/s). In the avoidance tests,
   concentrations of 2.5 and 5mg a.i./L caused the escape behavior of L.
   catesbeianus tadpoles. However, tadpoles were also able to avoid diuron
   contamination at environmental relevance, especially in concentrations
   of 25 and 50g a.i./L. As expected, avoidance and effects on swimming
   behavior ocurred at lower diuron concentrations than mortality.
   Sublethal diuron concentrations may thus lead to the displacement of
   organisms to more favorable areas when they are available and the
   ability to swim is not affected.},

Abstract = {The research on the enantioselective toxic effects of chiral pesticides
   on non-target aquatic organisms has attracted more and more attention.
   This study investigated the enantioselective toxic effects of
   mefentrifluconazole (MFZ) on acute toxicity, developmental toxicity,
   locomotor behaviors, and the mRNA relative expression levels of genes
   related to neurodevelopment and cardiac development in zebrafish embryos
   or larvae. The 96-h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) values (exposed to
   racemate and enantiomers of MFZ, that is, rac-MFZ/(-)-MFZ/(+)-MFZ) were
   1.010, 1.552, and 0.753 mg/L for embryo, and 0.753, 1.187, and 0.553
   mg/L for larvae. The rac-MFZ/(-)-MFZ/(+)-MFZ can affect the heart
   development of zebrafish embryos, accompanied by heart rate inhibition,
   yolk sac deformities, pericardial deformities, and down-regulation of
   genes related to cardiotoxicity in larvae in an enantioselective manner.
   Moreover, the rac-MFZ/(-)-MFZ/(+)-MFZ also can affect the neural
   development of zebrafish embryos, accompanied by autonomic movement
   inhibition, swimming speed and swimming distance abnormalities, and
   down-regulation of genes related to neurotoxicity in larvae in an
   enantioselective manner. For all toxicity endpoints, the effect of the
   (+)-MFZ to early-staged zebrafish were significantly greater than that
   of (-)-MFZ. These results will help distinguishing the difference of MFZ
   enantiomers to zebrafish, and provide scientific reference for improving
   the risk assessment of chiral pesticides MFZ.},

   showed weak genotoxic effects and statistically significant DNA damages
   were recorded in the cells exposed to highest tested concentration of 75

Abstract = {Thiamethoxam (TM) is a neonicotinoid insecticide that acts as a
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. While designed to
   specifically target invertebrate nAChRs, recent studies have reported
   adverse effects of neonicotinoid exposure in early life-stage fish. This
   study examined the health and neurobehavioral impacts of chronic
   exposure to various concentrations of TM or nicotine (NIC) in early life
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) in conjunction with in-silico molecular docking
   to compare their ligand-receptor interactions with vertebrate nAChR.
   Chronic exposure to both reduced survival by approximately 20\% (163 mu
   g TM/l) and 25-100\% (>= 0.49 mu g NIC/l). Hatching and growth were
   impaired following exposure to >= 0.21 mu g TM/l or 4.9 mu g NIC/l. Both
   TM and NIC produced morphological and behavioral indicators of
   neurotoxicity, with more potent effects following NIC exposure. NIC
   impaired embryonic motor activity by 40\% (49 mu g NIC/l), while both TM
   and NIC significantly altered predator escape response in larvae,
   specifically the latency and the initial burst movement of the response
   were impacted. Molecular docking predicted variations in the type and
   strength of interactions that occur between NIC or TM and vertebrate
   nAChR. These findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to TM might
   impact general health and neurobehavior of early-stage zebrafish. Our
   data support hypotheses that TM presents low affinity for vertebrate
   nAChR but may still pose an adverse risk to larval fish growth and
   neurobehavior.},

Abstract = {Background. As every organ within the body, the brain is also extremely
   susceptible to a plethora of noxious agents that change its chemistry.
   One component frequently found in current products against harmful
   species to crops is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has
   been demonstrated to cause neurodegenerative disorders such as
   Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have indeed revealed that
   rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming to show
   congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and
   Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to
   demonstrate how chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs
   the locomotor activity and sociability and induces oxidative stress in
   zebrafish. Results. There were no statistically significant differences
   following the analysis of their social interaction and locomotor tests
   (p>0.05). However, several exceptions have been noted in the control,
   rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their locomotor
   activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p<0.05). We
   further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying
   system as represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase
   (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite
   the fact that there were no statistically significant changes within SOD
   and GPx levels between the control group and rotenone, probiotics, and
   rotenone+probiotics (p>0.05), relevant changes have been observed
   between the analyzed groups (p<0.05 and p<0.005, respectively). On the
   other hand, significant differences (p<0.05) have been observed for MDA
   when we analyzed the data between the control group and the other three
   groups. Conclusions. Our results suggest that rotenone can be
   successfully used to trigger Parkinson's disease-related symptomatology

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {270},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In modern agricultural management, the use of pesticides is
   indispensable. Due to their massive use worldwide, pesticides represent
   a latent risk to both humans and the environment. In the present study,
   1056 frequently used pesticides were screened for oestrogen receptor
   (ER) agonistic activity by using in silico methods. We found that 72 and
   47 pesticides potentially have ER agonistic activity by the machine
   learning methods random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN),
   respectively. Among endocrinedisrupting chemicals (EDCs), 14 have been
   reported as EDCs or ER agonists by previous studies. We selected 3
   reported and 7 previously unreported pesticides from 76 potential ER
   agonists to further assess ERa agonistic activity. All 10 selected
   pesticides exhibited ERa agonistic activity in human cells or zebrafish.
   In the dual-luciferase reporter gene assays, six pesticides exhibited
   ERa agonistic activity. Additionally, nine pesticides could induce mRNA
   expression of the pS2 and NRF1 genes in MCF-7 cells, and seven
   pesticides could induce mRNA expression of the vtg1 and vtg2 genes in
   zebrafish. Importantly, the remaining 48 out of 76 potential ER
   agonists, none of which have previously been reported to have
   endocrine-disrupting effects or oestrogenic activity, should be of great
   concern. Our screening results can inform environmental protection goals
   and play an important role in environmental protection and early
   warnings to human health. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {232},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Pesticides are currently extensively used in agriculture, forestry,
   animal husbandry, and environmental hygiene, and their residues have
   become a global environmental problem, which can easily form combined
   pollution with heavy metals. The present study examined the effects of
   chronic (28 days) aqueous exposure of chiral penflufen (rac-penflufen,
   R-(-)-penflufen and S-(+)-penflufen), a widely used fungicide,
   with/without cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic heavy metal in zebrafish
   (Danio rerio). After rac-penflufen individual or combined exposure with
   Cd, the bioaccumulation and residual levels of S-(+)-penflufen were
   significantly higher than R-(-)-penflufen, and the effects of Cd were
   insignificantly. But for penflufen enantiomer, the effects of Cd were
   more serious for R- (-)-penflufen, which could increase the
   bioaccumulation (up to1.73 times), inhibit the dissipation (up to
   32.3\%) and enhance the residue (up to 5.35 times) of R-(-)-penflufen in
   zebrafish, decreasing the enantioselectivity. However, significant
   increase of S-(+)-penflufen concentrations was only found in viscera
   under co-exposure of Cd. The tissue distribution of penflufen
   enantiomers were not affected by the presence of Cd, and no
   intercon-version of the two enantiomers occurred regardless of the
   presence of Cd. These findings indicated that co-contamination with Cd
   could increase the persistence of R-(-)-penflufen in zebrafish, thus
   increasing the environmental risks. The significant differences of Cd
   effects on chiral pesticide enantiomer and racemate indicated that the
   combined pollution of heavy metal and chiral pesticide might have
   enantiomer-specific, which should raise concern, and the
   enantioselective mechanism deserve further study.},

Abstract = {The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent model system for assessing
   the effects of toxicant exposure on behavior and neurodevelopment. In
   the present study, we examined the effects of sub-chronic embryonic
   exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a ubiquitous anthropogenic
   pollutant, on anxiety-related behaviors. We found that exposure to the
   PCB mixture, Aroclor (A) 1254, from 2 to 26 h post-fertilization (hpf)
   induced two statistically significant behavioral defects in larvae at 7
   days postfertilization (dpf). First, during 135 min of free swimming,
   larvae that had been exposed to 2 ppm, 5 ppm or 10 ppm A1254 exhibited
   enhanced thigmotaxis (edge preference) relative to control larvae.
   Second, during the immediately ensuing 15-min visual startle assay, the
   5 ppm and 10 ppm PCB-exposed larvae reacted differently to a visual
   threat, a red `bouncing' disk, relative to control larvae. These results
   are consistent with the anxiogenic and attention-disrupting effects of
   PCB exposure documented in children, monkeys and rodents and merit
   further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of
   dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and movement defects,
   including bradykinesia, tremor, and postural imbalance. Whereas the
   etiology and pathogenesis of PD is still poorly understood, studies in
   animal models are providing important insights. One valuable type of
   animal model for PD is established by treating animals with PD-inducing
   neurotoxins, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
   (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat. These neurotoxins are thought to inhibit
   mitochondrial complex I activity leading to oxidative stress, impaired
   energy metabolism, proteasomal dysfunction, and, eventually, dopamine
   neuronal loss. However, the genes and pathways that underlie the
   neurotoxicity of these agents are not known. In this study, we explored
   the effect of MPTP, rotenone, and paraquat in both adult and larval
   zebrafish, which are highly amenable to genetic analysis that can lead
   to the identification of the underlying genes and pathways. Here, we
   report that adult zebrafish display behavioral alterations, including
   decreased locomotor activity in response to MPTP, whereas larval
   zebrafish exhibited developmental, behavioral, and DA sensitivity to
   these agents. Taken together, these findings suggest that zebrafish
   could be a valuable model for genetically dissecting the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of PD-inducing agents. (C) 2004

Title = {Developmental toxicity of the fungicide ziram in zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {214},
Pages = {303-313},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ziram is a broad spectrum pesticide that belongs to the class of
   dimethyl-dithiocarbamate (DTC) fungicides. The objectives of this study
   were to assess the effects of ziram in developing zebrafish. Ziram was
   highly toxic to zebrafish embryos, with a 96-h LC50 value of 1082.54 nM
   (similar to 0.33 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization
   (hpf) were exposed to solvent control (0.1\% DMSO), or one dose of 1,
   10, 100, and 1000 nM ziram for 96 h. Ziram induced lethality in a
   dose-dependent manner, decreased hatching rate and heartbeat, and caused
   wavy deformities at 72 and 96 hpf at 100 and 1000 nM. Basal oxygen
   consumption rates of zebrafish at 24 hpf were decreased with 1000 nM,
   suggesting that ziram affects oxidative phosphorylation. We also
   measured the expression of transcripts associated with the oxidative
   stress response (sod] and sod2) and dopamine receptor signaling at
   similar to 96 h of exposure. There was no difference in the expression
   of genes related to oxidative stress, nor those related to the dopamine
   system. Locomotor activity was also assessed in larval zebrafish (7
   dpf), and ziram increased total activity, the velocity in light zone,
   and total distance moved at 10 nM, while it decreased the mean time
   spent in the dark zone at 1 and 10 nM. Behavioral responses were
   dependent upon the time point and clutch examined. These data
   demonstrate that ziram negatively impacts embryonic development (i.e.
   mortality, hatching, heartbeat and notochord development) of zebrafish,
   decreases basal respiration of embryos, and alters behavioral responses
   in larvae. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Differential impact of dose-range glyphosate on locomotor behavior,
   neuronal activity, glio-cerebrovascular structures, and transcript
   regulations in zebrafish larvae},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {267},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The presence of glyphosate represents a debated ecotoxicological and
   health risk factor. Here, zebrafish larvae were exposed, from 1.5 to 120
   h post-fertilization, to a broad concentration range (0.05 -10.000 mu
   g/L) of glyphosate to explore its impact on the brain. We evaluated
   morphology, tracked locomotor behavior and neurophysiological
   parameters, examined neuro-glio-vascular cell structures, and outlined
   transcriptomic outcomes by RNA sequencing.
   At the concentration range tested, glyphosate did not elicit gross
   morphological changes. Behavioral analysis revealed a significant
   decrease in locomotor activity following the exposure to 1000 mu g/L
   glyphosate or higher. In parallel, midbrain electrophysiological
   recordings indicated abnormal, and variable, spike activity in zebrafish
   larvae exposed to 1000 mu g/L glyphosate. Next, we asked whether the
   observed neurophysiological outcome could be secondary to brain
   structural modifications. We used transgenic zebrafish and in vivo
   2-photon microscopy to examine, at the cellular level, the effects of
   the behavior-modifying concentration of 1000 mu g/L, comparing to low
   0.1 mu g/L, and control. We ruled out the presence of cerebrovascular
   and neuronal malformations. However, microglia morphological
   modifications were visible at the two glyphosate concentrations,
   specifically the presence of amoeboid cells suggestive of activation.
   Lastly, RNAseq analysis showed the deregulation of transcript families
   implicated in neuronal physiology, synaptic transmission, and
   inflammation, as evaluated at the two selected glyphosate
   concentrations.
   In zebrafish larvae, behavioral and neurophysiological defects occur
   after the exposure to high glyphosate concentrations while cellular and
   transcript signatures can be detected in response to low dose. The
   prospective applicability to ecotoxicology and the possible extension to
   brain-health vulnerability are critically discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A long-term toxicity test with zebrafish was carried out with different
   concentrations of DDT, Arochlor1254 (A54), and their 1: 1 mixture under
   flow-through conditions. By collecting and counting the number of sperm
   released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are
   released asynchronously. Sperms are released in the form of sperm trails
   laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the
   trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consist
   of bands of viscous material in which sperm are embedded. The water
   samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually
   within 180 min after 24 h, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of exposure.
   It was established that the reductions in count, activity of sperm, and
   average life span of sperm trails were significant (p<0.05) at the
   tested concentrations, 5 and 50 mug/L after 1 month and 2 weeks of
   exposure to each chemical tested and to their mixture, respectively. In
   conclusion, this study demonstrates that DDT and A54 could react
   synergically and increase the alteration in sperm release and activity
   as well as the life span of their trails. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Considering the intriguing relationship between immune system and
   behavior recently described in mammals, and the lack of information of
   this relationship in fish, here we describe for the first time the
   interaction between the immune system and social and exploratory
   behavior in zebrafish. Fish high responders to novelty (HRN) presented a
   proinflammatory profile, with increased IL-1 beta and reduced IL-10
   expression compared to fish low responders to novelty (LRN). Likewise,
   fish less responsive to social stimuli have a reduced expression of
   INF-gamma We show that fish with different behavior patterns have
   differences in the immune response. Our findings indicate that the
   interplay between immune system and behavior in zebrafish is similar to
   that found in mammalian models and that zebrafish should be considered
   as a potential model organism to study the relationship between immune
   system and behavior.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {565},
Pages = {758-766},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Pesticide contaminants are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose a
   threat to biodiversity. Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of
   action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife.
   Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological
   and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal
   effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and
   behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the
   largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of
   pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found
   that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides
   reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35\%, and
   reduced overall activity by 72\%. There were also differences in the
   magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect
   underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and
   organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as
   phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids,
   carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also
   produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no
   overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing
   activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of
   pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic
   vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We
   expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing
   the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management. (C)

Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The olfactory system, composed of the olfactory organs and the olfactory
   bulb, allows organisms to interact with their environment and through
   the detection of odor signals. Olfaction mediates behaviors pivotal for
   survival, such as feeding, mating, social behavior, and danger
   assessment. The olfactory organs are directly exposed to the milieu, and
   thus are particularly vulnerable to damage by environmental pollutants
   and toxicants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and surfactants, among
   others. Given the widespread occurrence of olfactory toxicants, there is
   a pressing need to understand the effects of these harmful compounds on
   olfactory function. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for
   studying human physiology, disease, and toxicity. Additionally, the
   anatomical components of the zebrafish olfactory system are similar to
   those of other vertebrates, and they present a remarkable degree of
   regeneration and neuroplasticity, making it an ideal model for the study
   of regeneration, reorganization and repair mechanisms following
   olfactory toxicant exposure. In this review, we focus on (1) the
   anatomical, morphological, and functional organization of the olfactory
   system of zebrafish; (2) the adverse effects of olfactory toxicants and
   injury to the olfactory organ; and (3) remodeling and repair
   neuroplasticity mechanisms following injury and degeneration by

Title = {Chitosan nanoparticles containing the insecticide dimethoate: A new
   approach in the reduction of harmful ecotoxicological effects},
Journal = {NANOIMPACT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Organophosphate insecticides such as dimethoate (DMT) are widely used in
   agriculture. As a side effect, however, these insecticides contaminate
   bodies of water, resulting in damage to aquatic organisms. The
   development of nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the
   control of agricultural pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing
   their toxicological effects. Based upon this, the present study has
   investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate chitosan nanoparticles
   (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on non-target
   organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM, as
   well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity
   was also evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT
   (NP + DMT), and commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and
   larvae of Danio rerio (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology,
   and behavior. The nanoparticle control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size
   values of 283 +/- 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 +/- 0.05 and a zeta potential of
   -31 +/- 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate, the
   nanoparticles showed 301 +/- 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 +/- 0.02, a
   zeta potential of -27.9 +/- 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 +/-
   0.32\%, with slow-release overtime (52\% after 48 h). The AFM images
   showed that both types of nanoparticles showed spherical morphology.
   Major toxic effects on embryo larval development were observed in
   commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the technical pesticide,
   predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With regard to the
   toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an
   increase for LC50-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior
   of the larvae was not affected. The data obtained demonstrate that
   nanoencapsulated dimethoate reduces the toxicity of insecticides on
   zebrafish larvae, suggesting that nanoencapsulation may be safer for
   non-target species, by eliminating collateral effects and thus promoting
   sustainable agriculture.},

Abstract = {Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) is an environmental contaminant

   Behavioral measurements showed that TBOEP exposure reduced embryonic
   spontaneous movement and decreased swimming speed of larvae in response
   to dark stimulation. In accordance with these motor effects, TBOEP
   treatment reduced neuron-specific GFP expression in transgenic Tg
   (HuC-GFP) zebrafish larvae and inhibited the growth of secondary
   motoneurons, as well as decreased expression of marker genes related to
   central nervous system development in TBOEP treated group. Furthermore,
   increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
   malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as reduction of SOD activity were
   detected in TBOEP exposure group. The present results showed that the
   alteration in motor neuron and oxidative stress could together lead to
   the motor behavior alterations induced by TBOEP.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Monceren 250 SC is a commercial fungicide with the active ingredient
   1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1-(cyclopentyl)-3-phenylurea, also known as
   pencycuron. This compound inhibits the growth of fungi as Rhizoctonia
   solani that invades potato, rice, and cotton or as Pellicularia spp,
   which contaminates lettuce and tomato crops. In this study, we assessed
   genotoxicity or DNA damage by the alkaline comet assay in zebrafish
   blastula-stage embryos exposed to 250 to 1250 mu g/mL of the Monceren
   fungicide or to Bleomycin (0.25 mu g/mL) used as a positive control.
   Additionally, survival and spontaneous movement were monitored in
   embryos after exposure to different concentrations of fungicide. DNA
   damage was evaluated using three genotoxicity parameters of the alkaline
   comet assay: tail length, tail moment, and tail intensity. We found that
   Monceren 250 SC fungicide induces DNA damage, as shown by significant
   increases in the three genotoxicity parameters in zebrafish embryos
   compared with control embryos nonexposed to Monceren. Tail intensity was
   the more accurate parameter to evaluate genotoxicity levels in zebrafish
   embryos. At 48 h after exposure to the fungicide, the survival rate of
   larvae-embryos was reduced to 40-45\%. This study shows that the
   Monceren 250 SC fungicide exerts genotoxic effects in zebrafish during
   early stages of development.},

Abstract = {Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are common replacements for the
   phased-out polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and have been detected
   at high concentrations in environmental samples. OPFRs are structurally
   similar to organophosphate pesticides and may adversely affect the
   developing nervous system. This study evaluated the overt toxicity,
   uptake, and neurobehavioral effects of tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)
   phosphate (TDCPP), tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris
   (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris (2,3-dibromopropyl)
   phosphate (TDBPP) in early life stage zebrafish. Chlorpyrifos was used
   as a positive control. For overt toxicity and neurobehavioral
   assessments, zebrafish were exposed from 0 to 5 days postfertilization
   (dpf). Hatching, death, or malformations were evaluated daily.
   Teratogenic effects were scored by visual examination on 6 dpf. To
   evaluate uptake and metabolism, zebrafish were exposed to 1 mu M of each
   organophosphate (OP) flame retardant and collected on 1 and 5 dpf to
   monitor accumulation. Larval swimming activity was measured in 6 dpf
   larvae to evaluate neurobehavioral effects of exposures below the acute
   toxicity threshold. TDBPP elicited the greatest toxicity at >1 mu M.
   TDCPP and chlorpyrifos were overtly toxic at concentrations >= 10 mu M,
   TCEP, and TCPP were not overtly toxic at the doses tested. Tissue
   concentrations increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the parent
   chemical after 24h exposures. TDCPP and TDBPP and their respective
   metabolites were detected in embryos on 5 dpf. For all chemicals tested,
   developmental exposures that were not overtly toxic significantly
   altered larval swimming activity. These data indicate that OPFRs
   adversely affect development of early life stage zebrafish.},

Title = {Biological impacts of glyphosate on morphology, embryo biomechanics and

Abstract = {All of these days, residues of herbicides such as glyphosate are widely
   distributed in the environment. The ubiquitous use of glyphosate has
   drawn extensive attention to its toxicity as an organic pollutant. In
   this study, we employed larval zebrafish as an animal model to evaluate
   the effect of different concentrations of glyphosate on early
   development via morphological, biomechanics, behavioral and
   physiological analyses. Morphological results showed that an obvious
   delay occurred in the epiboly process and body length, eye and head area
   were reduced at concentrations higher than 10 mg/L. The expression of
   ntl (no tail) shortened and krox20 (also known as Egr2b, early growth
   response 2b) changed as the glyphosate concentration increased, but
   there was no change in the expression of shh (sonic hedgehog). In
   addition, biomechanical analysis of the elasticity of chorion indicated
   that treated embryos' surface tension was declined. Furthermore, a 48-h
   locomotion test revealed that embryonic exposure to glyphosate
   significantly elevated locomotor activities, which is probably
   attributed to motoneuronal damage. The decreased surface tension of
   chorion and the increased locomotive activities may contribute to the
   hatching rates after glyphosate treatment. Our study enriches the
   researches of evaluating glyphosate toxicity and probablely plays a
   warning role in herbicides used in farming. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Herbicides diuron and fluazifop-p-butyl affect avoidance response and

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {210},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The usage of pesticides has been steadily increasing over the last
   decades, and among them herbicides are the most commonly used ones.
   Despite their main mode of action targeting plant organisms, they can
   also have adverse effects on non-target animal organisms. In soil
   ecosystems, earthworms play an important role due to their positive
   impacts on the soil functioning and they represent good model organisms
   in soil ecotoxicology. The aim of the present study was to assess the
   effects of two herbicides on several endpoints at different levels of
   biological organization in the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Diuron and
   fivazifop-p-butyl were selected for the investigation and their lethal
   concentrations were determined: LC50 48 h: 89.087 mu g/cm(2) for diuron
   and 6.167 mu g/cm(2) for fluazifop-p-butyl. Furthermore, measurements of
   enzymatic biomarkers (catalase (CAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
   carboxylesterase (CES) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)),
   multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity and gene expression of
   antioxidative enzymes (only for fluazifop-p-butyl) were conducted.
   Enzymatic biomarker responses showed no significant differences compared
   to the control after the exposure to the investigated herbicides,
   whereas the MXR activity was significantly inhibited. The gene
   expression level of superoxide dismutase (sod) and glutathione
   S-transferase (gst) after fivazifop-p-butyl exposure showed a
   significant increase. Finally, avoidance behavior in soil was assessed
   and it was determined that both herbicides caused significant avoidance
   response. The obtained results show that both investigated herbicides
   significantly affect earthworms on different levels of biological
   organization. This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive
   ecotoxicological assessment of herbicide effects on non-target organisms
   at all organizational levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Toxicity and fate of chiral insecticide pyriproxyfen and its metabolites
   in zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {280},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analogue insecticide used worldwide.
   At present, the potential threat of pyriproxyfen to aquatic organism has
   not been well explored. In this work, the bioaccumulation, metabolic
   profile and toxicity of pyriproxyfen and its metabolites to zebrafish
   were studied, and the enantioselectivity of pyriproxyfen and the major
   chiral metabolites were also determined. Sixteen metabolites of
   pyriproxyfen in zebrafish were identified. Hydroxylation, ether linkage
   cleavage and oxidation in phase I metabolism, followed by sulfate and
   glucuronic acid conjugation. The bioconcentration factors ranged from
   1175 to 1246. Hydroxylation metabolites of pyriproxyfen showed
   enantioselective behavior in zebrafish with enantiomer fractions (EFs)
   of 4'-OH- pyriproxyfen and 5 `'-OH- pyriproxyfen ranged from 0.50 to
   0.71. Toxicological indexes including acute toxicity, joint toxicity and
   oxidative stress were tested. Among all the metabolites, 4'-OH-
   pyriproxyfen was found 2 folds more toxic to zebrafish than
   pyriproxyfen. (-)-Pyriproxyfen was found 2 folds more toxic than rac-
   and (+)-pyriproxyfen. Antagonistic effects were found in binary joint
   toxicity of pyriproxyfen and its hydroxylated metabolites. Pyriproxyfen
   and its metabolites also showed oxidative stress damage by inhibiting
   the activity of CAT and SOD and increasing MDA. This work provided deep
   insight into the metabolism and the potential risks of pyriproxyfen to
   aquatic organisms. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   rotenone-treated zebrafish},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {103-109},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The pesticide rotenone is widely used to produce Parkinson's disease
   (PD)-like symptoms in rodents, but few studies have examined whether
   rotenone-treated zebrafish can serve as an animal model of PD. Here, we
   report that 4 weeks of rotenone treatment induced motor and non-motor
   PD-like symptoms in adult zebrafish. Compared with control fish,
   rotenone-treated fish spent less time swimming at a fast speed,
   indicating a deficit in motor function. In the light-dark box test,
   rotenone-treated fish exhibited longer latencies to enter the dark
   compartment and spent more time in the light compartment, reflecting
   anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Furthermore, rotenone-treated
   fish showed less of an olfactory preference for amino acid, indicating
   olfactory dysfunction. These behavioral symptoms were associated with
   decreased levels of dopamine in the brains of rotenone-treated fish.
   Taken together, these results suggest that rotenone-treated zebrafish
   are a suitable model of PD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effect of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the bioavailability and
   neurotoxicity of cypermethrin in zebrafish larvae},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {199},
Pages = {212-219},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In aquatic environment, the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) has been
   reported to modify the bioavailability and toxicity of the organic
   toxicants. Nevertheless, the combined toxicity of NPs and the pesticides
   that were used world-widely still remains unclear. Cypermethrin (CYP), a
   synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is commonly used for controlling
   agricultural and indoor pests. Therefore, the effects of titanium
   dioxide NPs (nTiO(2)) on CYP bio-concentration and its effects on the
   neuronal development in zebrafish were investigated in our study.
   Zebrafish embryos (2-hour-post-fertilization, hpf) were exposed to CYP
   (0, 0.4, 2 and 10 mu g/L) alone or co-exposed with nTiO(2) (1 mg/L)
   until 120-hpf. nTiO(2) is taken up by zebrafish larvae and also it can
   adsorb CYP. The zebrafish body burdens of CYP was observed and CYP
   uptake was increased by nTiO(2), indicating that the nTiO(2) could
   accelerate the bioaccumulation of CYP in larvae. Co-exposure of nTiO(2)
   and CYP induced the generation of reactive oxygen species. Exposure to
   CYP alone significantly decreased the mRNA expression of genes,
   including glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), alpha 1-tubulin,
   myelin basic protein (mbp) and growth associated protein (gap-43).
   Besides, reductions of serotonin, dopamine and GABA concentrations were
   observed in zebrafish and the larval locomotion was significantly
   decreased in response to the lower level of the neurotransmitters.
   Moreover, co-exposure of nTiO(2) and CYP caused further significantly
   decreased in the locomotion activity, and enhanced the down-regulation
   of the mRNA expression of specific genes and the neurotransmitters
   levels. The results demonstrated that nTiO(2) increased CYP accumulation
   and enhanced CYP-induced developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish.},

Abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used to objectively address
   the physical condition as an index of stress. Though a numerous accounts
   of investigations on aquatic organisms' ECGs have been made,
   differentiation of ECG parameters in responding to specific toxic
   chemicals has not been extensively studied. In this research, it is
   hypothesized that zebrafish (Danio rerio) ECG parameters would
   differently respond to different types of pollutants, a heavy metal,
   thallium (TI, 0.10 and 13.00 mu g/L) and an organic chemical,
   deltamethrin (DM, 0.52 and 2.00 mu g/L). Based on the SOM training and
   statistical analyses, QRS complex could be specified as an indicator of
   TI stress, while QT interval might be used to evaluate DM stress.
   Pearson correlation analysis indicated that QRS complex and QT interval
   were significantly associated with TI stress (r = 0.854, p = 0.0002) and
   DM stress (r= 0.792, p = 0.001), respectively. QRS complex and QT
   interval had the highest R-2, the minimum of SSE and the lowest AIC
   value in TI and DM treatments, respectively. Bases on the current
   experimental results and previous reports, QRS complex and QT interval
   could be considered as a specific indicator of TI and DM disturbances in
   the environment, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Veterinary antiparasitic pharmaceuticals as well as pesticides have been

   Combination of IVM at 100 mu g L-1 with CYP at 5 mu g L-1 exposure
   induced hatching delay and malformations at 96 hpf in zebrafish larvae
   as well as significant induction of cell death in zebrafish larvae. At
   the same time, the two single concentrations of IVM and CYP did not show
   a toxic effect on zebrafish development. In conclusion, our study

Abstract = {This paper was designed to study stereoselective enrichment and changes
   in gene expression when zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo-larvae were
   exposed to racemic, (-)-or (+)-PCB149 (2,2', 3,4',
   5',6-hexachlorobiphenyl). Based on bioconcentration analysis,
   non-racemic enrichment was significantly observed after racemic
   exposure. No isomerization between the two isomers was found after
   (-)/(+)-PCB149 exposure. Furthermore, based on gene expression-data
   mining, CYPs genes (cyp2k6, cyp19a1b, and cyp2aa4) were differential
   genes after (+)-PCB149 exposure. No obvious differences of dysregulation
   of gene expression caused by racemic and (-)-PCB149, were observed in
   embryo-larvae. The above results suggested that (-)-PCB149 could be
   considered as the main factor causing the dysregulation of gene
   expression in embryo-larvae after racemic exposure; and (+)-PCB149
   should be pursued apart from the racemate, when considering the toxicity

Abstract = {In agricultural areas, insecticides inevitably reach water bodies via
   leaching or run-off. While designed to be neurotoxic to insects,
   insecticides have adverse effects on a multitude of organisms due to the
   high conservation of the nervous system among phyla. To estimate the
   ecological effects of insecticides, it is important to investigate their
   impact on nontarget organisms such as fish. Using zebrafish as the
   model, we investigated how different classes of insecticides influence
   fish behavior and uncovered neuronal underpinnings of the associated
   behavioral changes, providing an unprecedented insight into the
   perception of these chemicals by fish. We observed that zebrafish larvae
   avoid diazinon and imidacloprid while showing no response to other
   insecticides with the same mode of action. Moreover, ablation of
   olfaction abolished the aversive responses, indicating that fish smelled
   the insecticides. Assessment of neuronal activity in 289 brain regions
   showed that hypothalamic areas involved in stress response were among
   the regions with the largest changes, indicating that the observed
   behavioral response resembles reactions to stimuli that threaten
   homeostasis, such as changes in water chemistry. Our results contribute
   to the understanding of the environmental impact of insecticide exposure
   and can help refine acute toxicity assessment.},

Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {In order to characterize the toxic response of zebra fish (Danio rerio)
   to Deltamethrin (DM), behavior strength (BS) and muscle AChE activity of
   zebra fish were investigated. The results showed that the average values
   of both BS and AChE activity showed a similarly decreased tendency
   asDMconcentration increased, which confirmed the dose-effect
   relationship, and high and low levels of AChE and BS partly matched low
   and high levels of exposure concentrations in self-organizing map. These
   indicated that AChE and BS had slight different aspects of toxicity
   although overall trend was similar. Behavior activity suggested a
   possibility of reviving circadian rhythmin test organisms after exposure
   to the chemical in lower concentration (0.1 TU). This type of rhythm
   disappeared in higher concentrations (1.0 TU and 2.0 TU). Time series
   trend analysis of BS and AChE showed an evident time delayed effect of
   AChE, and a 2 h AChE inhibition delay with higher correlation
   coefficients (r) in different treatments was observed. It was confirmed
   that muscle AChE inhibition of zebra fish is a factor for swimming
   behavior change, though there was a 2 h delay, and other factors should
   be investigated to illustrate the detailed behavior response mechanism.},

   effects in zebrafish embryos},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {For specific primary modes of action (MoA) in environmental non-target
   organisms, EU legislation restricts the usage of active substances of
   pesticides or biocides. Corresponding regulatory hazard assessments are
   costly, time consuming and require large numbers of non-human animal
   studies. Currently, predictive toxicology of development compounds
   relies on their chemical structure and provides little insights into
   toxicity mechanisms that precede adverse effects. Using the zebrafish
   embryo model, we characterized transcriptomic responses to a range of
   sublethal concentrations of six nerve-and muscle-targeting insecticides
   with different MoA (abamectin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, fipronil,
   imidacloprid \& methoxychlor). Our aim was to identify affected
   biological processes and suitable biomarker candidates for MoA-specific
   signatures. Abamectin showed the most divergent signature among the
   tested insecticides, linked to lipid metabolic processes. Differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) after imidacloprid exposure were primarily
   associated with immune system and inflammation. In total, 222 early
   responsive genes to either MoA were identified, many related to three
   major processes: (1) cardiac muscle cell development and functioning
   (tcap, desma, bag3, hspb1, hspb8, flnca, myoz3a, mybpc2b, actc2,
   tnnt2c), (2) oxygen transport and hypoxic stress (alas2, hbbe1.1,
   hbbe1.3, hbbe2, hbae3, igfbp1a, hif1al) and (3) neuronal development and
   plasticity (npas4a, egr1, btg2, ier2a, vgf). The thyroidal function
   related gene dio3b was upregulated by chlorpyrifos and downregulated by
   higher abamectin concentrations. Important regulatory genes for cardiac
   muscle (tcap) and forebrain development (npas4a) were the most
   frequently ifferentially expressed across all insecticide treatments. We
   consider the identified gene sets as useful early warning biomarker
   candidates, i.e. for developmental toxicity targeting heart and brain in
   aquatic vertebrates. Our findings provide a better understanding about
   early molecular events in response to the analyzed MoA. Perceptively,
   this promotes the development for sensitive and informative
   biomarker-based in vitro assays for toxicological MoA prediction and AOP
   refinement, without the suffering of adult fish.},

Abstract = {The developing central nervous system and the blood brain barrier are
   especially vulnerable and sensitive to different chemicals, including
   environmental contaminants and drugs. Developmental exposure to these
   compounds has been involved in several neurological disorders, such as
   autism spectrum disorders as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
   diseases. Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) have emerged as powerful toxicological
   model systems that can speed up chemical hazard assessment and can be
   used to extrapolate neurotoxic effects that chemicals have on humans.
   Zebrafish embryos and larvae are convenient for high-throughput
   screening of chemicals, due to their small size, low-cost, easy
   husbandry, and transparency. Additionally, zebrafish are homologous to
   other higher order vertebrates in terms of molecular signaling
   processes, genetic compositions, and tissue/organ structures as well as
   neurodevelopment. This mini review underlines the potential of the
   zebrafish as complementary models for developmental neurotoxicity
   screening of chemicals and describes the different endpoints utilized
   for such screening with some studies illustrating their use.},

Title = {Chronic Toxicity of Primary Metabolites of Chloroacetamide and
   Glyphosate to Early Life Stages of Marbled Crayfish Procambarus

Abstract = {Simple Summary Due to the rising population, it is necessary to ensure
   sustainable agricultural management, especially in agricultural
   production. Therefore, using pesticides is the only way to reach a
   sufficient number of crops for the human population. However, using
   these agrochemicals has one big disadvantage-harmful effects on
   non-target species. Since aquatic ecosystems are essential for biota,
   fauna, flora, and humans, this study provides information about the
   toxicity of primary metabolites of commonly used glyphosate and
   acetochlor herbicides. Generally, it is known that pesticide degradation
   products may have lower, the same, or even higher toxicity than their
   parental compounds. Moreover, the developmental stages are more
   predisposed to be affected by pollution than adults, and consequently,
   in the worst case, it may affect the whole species population. Due to
   this reason, we studied the toxicity of these metabolites on
   embryolarval marbled crayfish-how they can affect their growth,
   ontogenetic development, behaviour, and gill morphology. Our study
   revealed that these two metabolites alone induce changes in behaviour,
   antioxidant enzymes, and gill morphology, even in combination.
   Nevertheless, there is a gap in the knowledge about pesticides'
   metabolite toxicities, a small fraction of the hundreds with potential
   for entering the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, chronic toxicity tests
   are suitable for evaluating the toxicity of aquatic pollution.
   Degradation products of herbicides, alone and in combination, may affect
   non-target aquatic organisms via leaching or runoff from the soil. The
   effects of 50-day exposure of primary metabolites of chloroacetamide
   herbicide, acetochlor ESA (AE; 4 mu g/L), and glyphosate,
   aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; 4 mu g/L), and their combination (AMPA
   + AE; 4 + 4 mu g/L) on mortality, growth, oxidative stress, antioxidant
   response, behaviour, and gill histology of early life stages of marbled
   crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) were investigated. While no treatment
   effects were observed on cumulative mortality or early ontogeny, growth
   was significantly lower in all exposed groups compared with the control
   group. Significant superoxide dismutase activity was observed in
   exposure groups, and significantly higher glutathione S-transferase
   activity only in the AMPA + AE group. The gill epithelium in AMPA +
   AE-exposed crayfish showed swelling as well as numerous unidentified
   fragments in interlamellar space. Velocity and distance moved in
   crayfish exposed to metabolites did not differ from controls, but
   increased activity was observed in the AMPA and AE groups. The study
   reveals the potential risks of glyphosate and acetochlor herbicide usage
   through their primary metabolites in the early life stages of marbled
   crayfish.},

Abstract = {Methamidophos is a representative organophosphate insecticide. The
   knowledge of its developmental neurotoxicity is limited, especially for
   zebrafish in the early stages of their life. Four hour
   post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to several
   environmentally relevant concentrations of methamidophos (0, 25, and 500
   mu g/L) for up to 72 hpf. Locomotor behavior was then studied in the
   zebrafish larvae at this timepoint. Acridine orange (AO) staining was
   carried out in the zebrafish larvae, and the mRNA levels of genes
   associated with neural development (mbp and syn2a) were analyzed by
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The number of
   escape responders for mechanical stimulation was significantly decreased
   in exposed groups. AO staining showed noticeable signs of apoptosis
   mainly in the brain. In addition, the mRNA levels of mbp and syn2a were
   both significantly down-regulated in exposed groups. Our study provides
   the first evidence that methamidophos exposure can cause developmental
   neurotoxicity in the early stages of zebrafish life, which may be caused
   by the effect of methamidophos on neurodevelopmental genes and the
   activation of cell apoptosis in the brain.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {559-570},
Abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an integrative vertebrate model ideal for
   toxicity studies. The zebrafish genome is sequenced with detailed
   characterization of all life stages. With their genetic similarity to
   humans, zebrafish models are established to study biological processes
   including development and disease mechanisms for translation to human
   health. The zebrafish genome, similar to other eukaryotic organisms,
   contains microRNAs (miRNAs) which function along with other epigenetic
   mechanisms to regulate gene expression. Studies have now established
   that exposure to toxins and xenobiotics can change miRNA expression
   profiles resulting in various physiological and behavioral alterations.
   In this review, we cover the intersection of miRNA alterations from
   toxin or xenobiotic exposure with a focus on studies using the zebrafish
   model system to identify miRNA mechanisms regulating toxicity. Studies
   to date have addressed exposures to toxins, particulate matter and
   nanoparticles, various environmental contaminants including pesticides,
   ethanol, and pharmaceuticals. Current limitations of the completed
   studies and future directions for this research area are discussed.},

Abstract = {Although epoxiconazole is the worldwidely used fungicide, limited
   information is known about its toxic effects and bioaccumulation
   behavior in freshwater ecosystems. In this study, zebrafish were exposed
   to epoxiconazole at concentrations of 100 and 1000 mu g L-1 for 21 d.
   H-1 NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that low- and high-dose
   epoxiconazole exposure resulted in two similar but not identical
   patterns for the change of endogenous metabolites related to energy,
   lipid and amino acid metabolism. The expression of genes associated with
   mitochondrial respiratory chain, ATP synthesis and fatty acid
   beta-oxidation were further measured to explore the reason for the
   disturbed energy metabolism, finding epoxiconazole had an inhibition
   effect on the genes expression of the above ways. Significant
   enantio-selectivity was observed with (+)-epoxiconazole enrichment in
   the bioaccumulation process. These results will be of great importance
   in understanding the toxic effects induced by epoxiconazole and provide
   important basis for its comprehensive environmental assessment. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The species Ocimum basilicum L., Lamiaceae, is popular for culinary
   purposes and medicinal use as a larvicide, repellent, antifungal, and
   antimicrobial agent. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to
   evaluate the chemical composition and antinociceptive effect of the
   volatile oil of O. basilicum flowers using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)
   (n = 6/group) treated orally (20 mu l) with volatile oil (0.25, 1.25, or
   2.5 mg/ml; 20 mu l) or vehicle (0.9\% NaCl, 20 mu l). The volatile oil
   of the O. basilicum flowers was obtained by hydrodistillation and
   analyzed by GC-MS, and the antinociceptive action is evaluated by
   different stimuli using motor parameters. The analysis of the chemical
   profile identified fourteen components with linalool (1) as a major
   chemical constituent (56.37\%). The oral administration of volatile oil
   did not show any acute toxicity or behavior effects in all tested doses.
   The volatile oil has a pharmacological potential for the treatment of
   acute pain by modulation of opioid system, N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors (glutamatergic receptor), and the transient receptor potential
   vanilloid subtype 1 and acid-sensing ion channels. Together, these data
   provide support for analgesic properties of the volatile oil and
   contribute to suggest that the adult zebrafish model presents the
   cheapest, cost-effective pharmacological alternative for the discovery
   of novel analgesics.},

Abstract = {Developmental exposure of rats to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF)
   causes persistent neurobehavioral impairment. In a parallel series of
   studies with zebrafish, we have also found persisting behavioral
   dysfunction after developmental CPF exposure. We have developed a
   battery of measures of zebrafish behavior, which are reliable and
   sensitive to toxicant-induced damage. This study determined the critical
   duration of developmental CPF exposure for causing persisting
   neurobehavioral effects. Tests of sensorimotor response (tap startle
   response and habituation), stress response (novel tank diving test) and
   learning (3-chamber tank spatial discrimination) were conducted with
   adult zebrafish after early developmental CPF exposure. The CPF exposure
   level was 100 ng/ml with durations of 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 and 0-5 days
   after fertilization. Developmental CPF exposure had persisting
   behavioral effects in zebrafish tested as adults. In the tactile startle
   test, CPF exposed fish showed decreased habituation to startle and a
   trend toward increased overall startle response. In the novel tank
   exploration test, exposed fish showed decreased escape diving response
   and increased swimming activity. In the 3-chamber learning test, the 0-5
   day CPF exposure group had a significantly lower learning rate. There
   was evidence for persisting declines in brain dopamine and
   norepinepherine levels after developmental CPF exposure. In all of the
   measures the clearest persistent effects were seen in fish exposed for
   the full duration of five days after fertilization. In a follow-up
   experiment there were some indications for persisting behavioral effects
   after exposure during only the later phase of this developmental window.
   This study demonstrated the selective long-term neurobehavioral
   alterations caused by exposure to CPF in zebrafish. The zebrafish model
   can facilitate the determination of the molecular mechanisms underlying
   long-term neurobehavioral impairment after developmental toxicant
   exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   (MCRH) was developed using a nano-composite including palygorskite

Title = {Bifenthrin exposure causes hyperactivity in early larval stages of an
   endangered fish species at concentrations that occur during their
   hatching season},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {228},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Bifenthrin is a pyrethmid insecticide commonly used in agricultural and
   urban sectors, and is found in watersheds worldwide. As a sodium channel
   blocker, at sublethal concentrations it causes off-target effects,
   including disruption of calcium signaling and neuronal growth. At the
   whole organism level, sublethal concentrations of bifenthrin cause
   behavioral effects in fish species, raising concerns about the neumtoxic
   properties of the compound on fish populations. Here we describe the
   application of a high-throughput behavioral system to evaluate
   contaminant impacts on the sensitive early-life stages of Delta smelt
   (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered teleost species
   endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD), California, USA.
   Leveraging the natural behavior of early-larval Delta smelt, whereby
   they increase movement in bright light and decrease movement in the
   dark, we developed a test using a cycle of light and dark periods in a
   closed chamber to test hyper- or hypoactivity for this species. We show
   that early-larval Delta smelt have a significant preference to move
   toward light, and utilized the behavioral test to evaluate the impact of
   exposure to bifenthrin at concentrations found in habitats where Delta
   smelt reportedly spawn, ranging up to concentrations detected in
   tributaries to these habitats. All tested concentrations of bifenthrin
   (nominal 2, 10, or 100 ng/L) caused hyperactivity, over a 96 h exposure,
   with noted significance determined during the light period of the test.
   To further understand the impact of bifenthrin exposure, expression of a
   suite of genes relevant to neurodevelopment, the mechanistic target of
   rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and biotransformation in exposed
   larvae were also measured. Following exposure to picomolar
   concentrations of bifenthrin, expression of genes in the mTOR signaling
   and neurogenesis pathways were altered alongside behavior. This study
   demonstrates how light and dark cycle behavioral tests can be used to
   assess sensitive alterations in swimming activity in Delta smelt at
   early developmental stages and how gene expression can complement these
   assays. This approach can be used to assess the impact of multiple
   compounds that occur within the restricted habitat of Delta smelt, thus
   having the potential to greatly inform conservation management
   strategies for this critically sensitive life stage.},

Abstract = {Permethrin (PM) is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide widely used as
   domestic repellent. Damage effects to nontarget organisms have been
   reported, particularly in the early stages of development. Studies
   indicate redox unbalance as secondary PM effect. Therefore, our goal was
   to investigate the acute PM effects on larval zebrafish. Larvae (6 days
   postfertilization) were exposed to PM (25-600 mu g/L) during 24 hours,
   and 50\% lethal concentration was estimated. For subsequent assays, the
   sublethal PM concentrations of 25 and 50 mu g/L were used. PM increased
   anxiety-like behaviors according to the Novel Tank and Light-Dark tests.
   At the molecular level, PM induced increased ROS, which may be related
   to the increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis detected
   in PM-exposed organisms. In parallel, upregulation of the antioxidant
   system was detected after PM exposure, with increased superoxide
   dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase
   activities, and thiol levels. The increased of Nrf2 target genes and the
   activation of an electrophile response element-driven reporter
   Tg(EPRE:LUC-EGFP) suggest that the Nrf2 pathway can mediate a fast
   response to PM, leading to antioxidant amplification. By using
   high-resolution respirometry, we found that exposure to PM decreased the
   oxygen consumption in all respiratory stages, disrupting the oxidative
   phosphorylation and inhibiting the electron transfer system, leading to
   decrease in bioenergetics capacity. In addition, PM led to increases of
   residual oxygen consumption and changes in substrate control ratio.
   Glucose metabolism seems to be affected by PM, with increased lactate
   dehydrogenase and decreased citrate synthase activities. Taken together,
   our results demonstrated the adverse effects of acute sublethal PM
   concentrations during larval development in zebrafish, causing apparent
   mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating a potential mechanism to redox
   unbalance and oxidative stress, which may be linked to the detected cell
   death and alterations in normal behavior patterns caused by acute PM
   exposure.},

Title = {The fungicide imazalil induces developmental abnormalities and alters
   locomotor activity during early developmental stages in zebrafish},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {455-461},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The fungicide imazalil (IMZ) is used extensively to protect vegetable
   fields, fruit plantations and post-harvest crops from rot. Likely due to
   its wide-spread use, IMZ is frequently detected in vegetable, fruit,
   soil and even surface water samples. Even though several previous
   studies have reported on the neurotoxicity of IMZ, its effects on the
   neurobehavior of zebrafish have received little attention to date. In
   this study, we show that the heartbeat and hatchability of zebrafish
   were significantly influenced by IMZ concentrations of 300 mu g L-1 or
   higher. Moreover, in zebrafish larvae, locomotor behaviors such as
   average swimming speed and swimming distance were significantly
   decreased after exposure to 300 mu g L-1 IMZ for 96 h, and
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression and activity were consistently
   inhibited in IMZ-treated fish. Our results further suggest that IMZ
   could act as a neuroendocrine disruptor by decreasing the expression of
   neurotoxicity-related genes such as Glial fibrillary acidic protein
   (Gfap), Myelin basic protein (Mbp) and Sonic hedgehog a (Shha) during
   early developmental stages of zebrafish. In conclusion, we show that
   exposure to IMZ has the potential to induce developmental toxicity and
   locomotor behavior abnormalities during zebrafish development. (C) 2016

Title = {Enantioselective bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and thyroid
   disruption assessment of cis-metconazole enantiomers in zebrafish (Danio

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {248},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Chiral triazole pesticides may cause enantioselectively adverse effects
   to non-target organisms. In this work, we employed zebrafish as an
   aquatic organism model to explore stereoselective acute toxicity,
   bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and thyroid disruption of
   cis-metconazole enantiomers. The median lethal concentration values of
   (1S, 5R)-metconazole, (1R, 5S)-metconazole, and the mixture of them
   against zebrafish were 4.01, 2.61 and 3.17 mg???L- 1, respectively. (1R,
   5S)-Metconazole was preferentially bioaccumulated in zebrafish than (1S,
   5R)metconazole, and the bioconcentration factor of (1R, 5S)-metconazole
   was 1.28-fold larger than that of (1S, 5R)metconazole. Then, the
   activity order of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S
   transferase enzymes in zebrafish was expressed as (1S, 5R)-metconazole >
   the mixture > (1R, 5S)-metconazole, while the order of malondialdehyde
   content in zebrafish was (1R, 5S)-metconazole > the mixture > (1S,
   5R)-metconazole. Moreover, cis-metconazole exhibited enantioselective
   regulation effects on the levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine in
   zebrafish, and (1R, 5S)-metconazole possessed stronger thyroid
   disruption ability to zebrafish than the others. By virtue of molecular
   docking methodology, the binding affair and docking energy results
   supported that interactions between (1R, 5S)-metconazole and thyroid
   hormone receptors were much stronger than those between (1S,
   5R)-metconazole and same receptors. This study of enantioselective
   evaluation of cis-metconazole in zebrafish can provide favorable
   information for risk assessments of chiral pesticides toward environment
   and health of aquatic organisms.},

Title = {2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid containing herbicide impairs essential
   visually guided behaviors of larval fish},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {209},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aquatic herbicides are used worldwide to eradicate nuisance and invasive
   plants despite limited knowledge of their toxicity to non-target
   organisms. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a common active
   ingredient in commercial herbicide formulations, which triggers plant
   cell death by mimicking the plant-specific hormone auxin. Application
   practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly
   freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to
   xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D
   on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may
   alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem
   dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a
   2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated
   morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D
   concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic
   or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day
   larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey
   capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed
   larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow
   perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4
   exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period
   of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval
   zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within
   the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest
   that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits
   underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided
   behaviors required for survival.},

Title = {Kinetic Processes of Acute Atrazine Toxicity to Brachydanio rerio in the
   Presence and Absence of Suspended Sediments},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {226},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Suspended sediments can decrease the apparent bio-concentration factor
   of organic pollutants through adsorption. However, whether this process
   also weakens the toxicity of organic pollutants to non-target aquatic
   organisms is not clear. Therefore, natural sediments were chosen as
   suspended sediment examples in this research applying atrazine as the
   target pollutant and Brachydanio rerio (more recently, Danio rerio
   (Zebrafish)) as the target organism to conduct acute toxicity
   experiments. The concentration of atrazine in aqueous solution was
   measured as a time series. Results show that without suspended
   sediments, the 96-h LC50 of atrazine to Brachydanio rerio is 29.06 mg/l
   at 95 \% confidence interval (24.41 to 40.70 mg/l). For suspended
   sediments of 7500 and 15,000 mg/l, the LC50 (i.e., concentration
   resulting in 50 \% mortality) equates to 30.74 and 39.51 mg/l,
   respectively, and the corresponding confidence intervals are between
   27.17 and 40.91 mg/l and between 30.43 and 126.93 mg/l in that order.
   Probit analysis, which is a type of regression used to analyze binomial
   response variables, was applied using the Statistical Package for the
   Social Sciences. For the series of no suspended solids (SS), 7500 and
   15,000 mg/l SS, the so-called no-observed-effective concentrations were
   3, 9, and 15 mg/l, correspondingly. The uptake quantity and uptake rate
   of atrazine by B. rerio according to atrazine concentrations in the
   aqueous solution were computed. The research indicates that suspended
   sediments can decrease the absorbed rate of atrazine by B. rerio. Thus,
   suspended sediments weaken the acute toxicity of atrazine to B. rerio.},

Title = {Behavioral changes occur earlier than redox alterations in developing

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {268},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {As agriculture expands to provide food and wellbeing to the world's
   growing population, there is a simultaneous increasing concern about the
   use of agrochemicals, which can harm non-target organisms, mainly in the
   aquatic environment. The fungicide Mancozeb (MZ) has been used on a
   large-scale and is a potent inducer of oxidative stress. Therefore,
   there is an urgent need for the development of more sensitive biomarkers
   designed to earlier biomonitoring of this compound. Here we tested the
   hypothesis that behavioral changes induced by sublethal MZ
   concentrations would occur first as compared to biochemical oxidative
   stress markers. Embryos at 4 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to
   Mancozeb at 5, 10 and 20 mu g/L. Controls were kept in embryo water
   only. Behavioral and biochemical parameters were evaluated at 24, 28,
   72, and 168 hpf after MZ exposure. The results showed that MZ
   significantly altered spontaneous movement, escape responses, swimming
   capacity, and exploratory behavior at all exposure times. However,
   changes in ROS steady-stead levels and the activity of antioxidant
   enzymes were observable only at 72 and 168 hpf. In conclusion,
   behavioral changes occurred earlier than biochemical alterations in
   zebrafish embryos exposed to MZ, highlighting the potential of
   behavioral biomarkers as sensitive tools for biomonitoring programs. (C)

Title = {Developmental exposure to low concentrations of two brominated flame
   retardants, BDE-47 and BDE-99, causes life-long behavioral alterations
   in zebrafish},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {221-232},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as
   flame retardants until the early 2000s, mainly in home furnishings and
   electronics. The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to
   continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children
   experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest
   that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain
   development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We
   investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two
   prominent PBDEs; 2,2',4,4',5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and
   2,2',4,4',-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development
   on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the
   organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented
   neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans.
   Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual
   treatments; 0.1\% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 mu M CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1,
   0.3 mu M BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3,1, 3,10, 20 mu M BDE-99 from 5 until
   120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as
   those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were
   conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for
   locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish
   were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related
   behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and
   predator avoidance.
   Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in
   larvae treated with 0.3 mu M CPF and 0.1 mu M BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment
   caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 mu M causing hyperactivity
   and 1 mu M or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult
   anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in
   both the novel tank dive test and tap test.
   Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low
   concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and
   the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term
   behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low
   exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval
   activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Journal = {ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Depending on the increase in agricultural production, the use of
   pesticides has also increased worldwide. Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid
   pesticide and one of the most widely used in the world. In this study,
   it was aimed to investigate the histopathological changes in zebrafish
   ovary and testis tissue caused by imidacloprid, which pollutes the
   aquatic ecosystem in various ways. It has been shown that imidacloprid
   causes histopathological changes in the gonads by causing deterioration
   in the structure of reproductive cells.
   Neonicotinoids are the new class of insecticides that are high target
   specificity to insects. Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid that is the most
   widely used insecticide in the world. As a result of its widespread use
   in agriculture, imidacloprid interferes with the aquatic system and
   threatens the aquatic environment. In this study, an investigation of
   the histopathological effects of imidacloprid on zebrafish gonads was
   aimed. Zebrafish were exposed to 9.5 mg/L, 19 mg/L, and 38 mg/L of
   imidacloprid for 5 days, considering the 96 h LC50 value. After
   dissecting the gonadal tissues, routine histological techniques were
   applied, and the tissues were stained with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS),
   Toluidine Blue (TB), and Haematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E). Sections were
   examined under a light microscope. While normal gonad histology was
   observed in the control group, histopathological alternations such as
   degeneration and union in the seminiferous tubules, hypertrophy in
   spermatogenic and Leydig cells, and interstitial fibrosis were detected
   in testicular tissue of the experimental groups. In the ovarian tissues
   of the experimental groups, structural deterioration in oocytes,
   autolysis, increase in the number of atretic oocytes, vacuolization in
   cortical alveoli, thickening and curling in the zona radiata, and
   opening in the perifollicular layers were detected.},

Abstract = {Indoxacarb is a typical chiral insecticide widely used in agricultural
   pest control. In the present study, zebrafish was used as a model animal
   to explore the enantioselective bioaccumulation behavior of indoxacarb
   to nontarget species in aquatic environments. Zebrafish were exposed to
   0.025 and 0.1 mg/L rac-indoxacarb solution for 12 d under the semistatic
   method, and the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and enantiomeric fraction
   of zebrafish were investigated. The results showed that the
   (-)-R-indoxacarb preferentially accumulated in zebrafish. The BCF values
   at 0.025 mg/L exposure levels were 1079.8 and 83.4 L/kg for
   (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb after 12 d, respectively. The BCF
   values at 0.1 mg/L exposure levels were 1752.1 and 137.0 L/kg for
   (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb after 10 d, respectively. The
   half-life values of (-)-R-indoxacarb and (+)-S-indoxacarb were 3.47 and
   2.05 d for 0.025 mg/L concentration exposure and 4.95 and 2.66 d for 0.1
   mg/L concentration exposure, respectively. The enantiomeric fraction
   values were in the range of 0.48 to 0.55 and 0.89 to 1.00 for water and

   behavioral alteration in zebrafish larvae},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {76-88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mepanipyrim, an anilinopyrimidine fungicide, has been extensively used
   to prevent fungal diseases in fruit culture. Currently, research on
   mepanipyrim-induced toxicity in organisms is still very scarce,
   especially visual developmental toxicity. Here, zebrafish larvae were
   employed to investigate mepanipyrim-induced visual developmental
   toxicity. Intense light and monochromatic light stimuli-evoked escape
   experiments were used to investigate vision-guided behaviors. Meanwhile,
   transcriptomic sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR assays were
   applied to assess the potential mechanisms of mepanipyrim-induced visual
   developmental toxicity and vision-guided behavioral alteration. Our
   results showed that mepanipyrim exposure could induce retinal impairment
   and vision-guided behavioral alteration in larval zebrafish. In
   addition, the grk1b gene of the phototransduction signaling pathway was
   found to be a potential aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated gene.
   Mepanipyrim-induced visual developmental toxicity was potentially
   related to the AhR signaling pathway. Furthermore, mepanipyrim-induced
   behavioral alteration was guided by the visual function, and the effects
   of mepanipyrim on long and middle wavelength light-sensitive opsins may
   be the main cause of vision-guided behavioral alteration. Our results
   provide insights into understanding the relationship between visual

Abstract = {The chemical threat agent tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a
   gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA AR) antagonist that causes
   life threatening seizures. Currently, there is no specific antidote for
   TETS intoxication. TETS-induced seizures are typically treated with
   benzodiazepines, which function as nonselective positive allosteric
   modulators (PAMs) of synaptic GABAARs. The major target of TETS was
   recently identified as the GABAAR alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2 subtype in
   electrophysiological studies using recombinantly expressed receptor
   combinations. Here, we tested whether these in vitro findings translate
   in vivo by comparing the efficacy of GABAAR subunit-selective PAMs in
   reducing TETS-induced seizure behavior in larval zebrafish. We tested
   PAMs targeting alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 2/3/5, alpha 6, ss2/3, ss1/2/3,
   and delta subunits and compared their efficacy to the benzodiazepine
   midazolam (MDZ). The data demonstrate that alpha 2- and alpha
   6-selective PAMs (SL-651,498 and SB-205384, respectively) were effective
   at mitigating TETS-induced seizure-like behavior. Combinations of
   SB-205384 and MDZ or SL-651,498 and 2-261 (ss2/3-selective) mitigated
   TETS-induced seizure-like behavior at concentrations that did not elicit
   sedating effects in a photomotor behavioral assay, whereas MDZ alone
   caused sedation at the concentration required to stop seizure behavior.
   Isobologram analyses suggested that SB-205384 and MDZ interacted in an
   antagonistic fashion, while the effects of SL-651,498 and 2-261 were
   additive. These results further elucidate the molecular mechanism by
   which TETS induces seizures and provide mechanistic insight regarding
   specific countermeasures against this chemical convulsant.},

Abstract = {Chiral pesticides are used widely in the world, and at present, older
   racemic products are being replaced by enantiopure products because of
   accelerated development of asymmetry synthesis techniques. Pesticides as
   xenobiotic released into environment impose a great stress on nontarget
   organisms. Although it is a necessary procedure for pesticides to have a
   registration based on toxicological data from nontarget organism, until
   now ecological risk assessment about metalaxyl only depend on racemic
   products. Hence, we investigated the acute, chronic, and sublethal
   toxicity of R-metalaxy and rac-metalaxyl on aquatic organisms such as D.
   magna (Daphnia magna), algae (Scenedesmus quadricanda), and adult
   zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed a significant difference in
   toxicity between R-metalaxyl and rac-metalaxyl. R-Metalaxy was about
   20-fold more toxic to algae than rac-metalaxyl with IC50 of 222.89 +/-
   1.18 mg/L and 19.95 +/- 1.12 mg/L, respectively. Similarly, R-metalaxyl
   was about fourfold toxic to D. magna than rac-metalaxyl according to the
   individual 24-h-LC50 values, and sixfold toxic than rac-metalaxyl based
   on 24-h-EC50 values. In the light of 48-h-LC50 and EC50, this difference
   in toxicity was more significant. As for adult zebrafish, there was no
   pronounced difference in acute toxicity, in addition, at sublethal level
   a different pattern in inducing Na+,K+-ATPase activity between them was
   found. In general, R-metalaxyl seemed more toxic to aquatic organisms
   than rac-metalaxyl. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 24:

Abstract = {Mancozeb (MZ), a manganese/zinc-containing ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate
   (EBCD) fungicide has been claimed to present low acute toxicity and
   short environmental persistence, however, its effects on embryogenesis
   in nontarget organisms is unclear. Here, we used zebrafish embryos
   (5hpf) to assess the potential embryotoxic effects induced by MZ (up to
   72hpf) as well as the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this
   process by pre-treatment with a classical antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine,
   NAC). Markers of reactive oxygen species production (ROS), glutathione
   (GSH) levels and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were measured
   along with genotoxicity (comet assay), cell death (Acridine Orange) and
   behavioral parameters (spontaneous movement, touch stimulation and
   swimming response), in order to determine potential mechanisms of
   embryotoxicity. According to results, MZ was able to induce
   morphological abnormalities such as body axis distortion, DNA damage,
   cell death, increased ROS generation and changes in behavioral endpoints
   during zebrafish development. All these toxic effects were inhibited by
   the pre-treatment with NAC indicating a key role of redox unbalance
   during MZ-induced embryotoxicity. At least in our knowledge, this is the
   first report on the deleterious effect of MZ to the normal embryogenesis
   of zebrafish. In addition, the importance of ROS generation during this
   pathophysiological condition was highlighted.},

Title = {Enantioselective bioaccumulation and metabolism of lactofen in zebrafish
   Danio rerio and combined effects with its metabolites},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Volume = {213},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pesticide residue in agricultural land might led to contamination of
   fresh waters, creating potential risks to organisms. The environmental
   behavior of herbicide lactofen may be enantioselective and the
   metabolites may have high toxic effects in individual or in combination.
   In this work, the enantioselective bioaccumulation, metabolism and toxic
   effects of lactofen and three metabolites (desethyl lactofen,
   acifluorfene, and amino acifluorfene) in zebrafish were investigated.
   The antioxidase activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione
   peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase), lipid peroxidation content
   were measured after exposure, and genetic toxicity was evaluated by a
   micronucleus test. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) method was
   used to determine the effects of the lactofen and its metabolites as
   well as their combinations. The metabolites were found to have higher
   toxic effects, and enantioselective toxic effects of lactofen and
   desethyl lactofen were observed, with the S-enantiomer more toxic. Based
   on IBR values, synergistic effects existed in combination of lactofen
   and desethyl lactofen, while antagonistic effects of lactofen with
   acifluorfene or amino acifluorfene were observed. Zebrafish were exposed
   to 0.5 mg L-1 lactofen and the bioaccumulation were measured during a 15
   d period followed by a 7 d elimination. The half-lives of the
   metabolites varied between 0.66 and 5.21 d, with bioconcentration
   factors (BCFs) in the range of 39-120. The metabolic pathways of R- and
   S-lactofen were found to be significantly different. The results
   supported our hypothesis. Therefore, the assessment of enantiomers and
   metabolites in individual or in combination should be taken into
   consideration in evaluating chiral pesticide risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {The effects of Atrazine, an herbicide used worldwide and considered as a
   potential contaminant in aquatic environments, were assessed on the
   Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus acutely (24 and 48 h) exposed to 2
   or 10 pg L-1 of atrazine by using a set of biochemical and genetic
   biomarkers. The following parameters were measured in the liver:
   activity of the biotransformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase
   (EROD) and glutathione S transferase (GST), antioxidant enzymes
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase
   (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), content of reduced glutathione (GSH),
   generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and occurrence of lipid
   peroxidation (LPO); in brain and muscle the activity of
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and DNA damage (comet assay) on
   erythrocytes, gills and liver cells. A general decreasing trend on the
   biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes was observed in the liver of
   P. lineatus exposed to atrazine; except for GR, all the other
   antioxidant enzymes (SOD. CAT and GPx) and biotransformation enzymes
   (EROD and GST) showed inhibited activity. Changes in muscle or brain
   AChE were not detected. DNA damage was observed in the different cell
   types of fish exposed to the herbicide, and it was probably not from
   oxidative origin, since no increase in ROS generation and LPO was
   detected in the liver. These results show that atrazine behaves as
   enzyme inhibitor, impairing hepatic metabolism, and produces genotoxic
   damage to different cell types of P. lineatus. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Pesticides such as chlorpyrifos (CPF) and metals such as copper can
   impair swimming behavior in fish. However, the impact to swimming
   behavior from exposure to mixtures of neurotoxicants has received little
   attention. In the current study, we analyzed spontaneous swimming rates
   of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate in vivo mixture
   interactions involving two chemical classes. Zebrafish were exposed to
   the neurotoxicants copper chloride (CuCl, 0.1 mu M, 0.25 mu M, 0.6 mu M,
   or 63, 16,40 ppb), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 0.1 mu M, 025 mu M, 0.6 mu M, or
   35, 88, 220 ppb) and binary mixtures for 24 h to better understand the
   effects of Cu on CPF neurotoxicity. Exposure to CPF increased the number
   of animals undergoing freeze responses (an anti-predator behavior) and,
   at the highest CPF dose (0.6 mu M), elicited a decrease in zebrafish
   swimming rates. Interestingly, the addition of Cu caused a reduction in
   the number of zebrafish in the CPF exposure groups undergoing freeze
   responses. There was no evidence of additive or synergistic toxicity
   between Cu and CPF. Although muscle AChE activity was significantly
   reduced by CPF, there was a relatively poor relationship among muscle
   AChE concentrations and swimming behavior, suggesting non-muscle AChE
   mechanisms in the loss of swimming behavior. In summary, we have
   observed a modulating effect of Cu on CPF swimming impairment that
   appears to involve both AChE and non-AChE mechanisms. Our study supports
   the utility of zebrafish in understanding chemical mixture interactions
   and neurobehavioral injury. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {218},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Accumulating studies have revealed the toxicity of antimony (Sb) to
   soil-dwelling and aquatic organisms at the individual level. However,
   little is known about the neumtoxic effects of antimony and its
   underlying mechanisms. To assess this issue, we investigated the
   neurotoxicity of antimony (0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg/L) in zebrafish
   embryos. After exposure, zebrafish embryos showed abnormal phenotypes
   such as a shortened body length, morphological malformations, and
   weakened heart function. Behavioral experiments indicated that antimony
   caused neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, manifested in a decreased
   spontaneous movement frequency, delayed response to touch, and reduced
   movement distance. We also showed that antimony caused a decrease in
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in zebrafish embryos, along with
   decreased expression of neurofunctional markers such as gfap, nestin,
   mbp, and shha. Additionally, antimony significantly increased reactive
   oxygen species levels and significantly reduced glutathione (GSH) and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In summary, our findings indicated
   that antimony can induce developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in
   zebrafish embryos by affecting neurotransmitter systems and oxidative
   stress, thus altering behavior. These outcomes will advance our
   understanding of antimony-induced neumtoxicity, environmental problems,
   and health hazards.},

Abstract = {Animal behaviour is the interaction between environment and an
   individual organism, which also can be influenced by its neighbours.
   Variations in environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants,
   may lead to neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the
   behavioural repertoire of the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide
   widely used in agriculture that is frequently detected in surface water,
   affecting non-target species. The zebrafish is a valuable model organism
   to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of different
   contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also
   all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The
   goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ
   exposure in defensive behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis,
   and depth preference) using the split depth tank. Furthermore, to
   investigate a putative role of cholinergic signalling on ATZ-mediated
   effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were exposed to
   ATZ for 14 days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2\%
   acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000 mu g/L). The behaviour of four animals in
   the same tank was recorded for 6 min and biological samples were
   prepared. Our results showed that 1000 mu g/L ATZ significantly
   increased the inter-fish distance, as well as the nearest and farthest
   neighbour distances. This group also presented an increase in the shoal
   area with decreased social interaction. No significant differences were
   detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency to enter
   the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,
   but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls.
   Although ATZ did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE
   activity in brain. Exposure to 10 mu g/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or
   AChE activity. These data suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours
   of zebrafish, which could be related to its action on brain cholinergic
   neurotransmission. Moreover, the use of the split depth tank could be an
   alternative strategy to assess group behaviour and depth preference
   after exposure to chemical compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Effects of the exposure of fish to triazine herbicides},
Journal = {NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {3-25},
Abstract = {Triazines are an important group of herbicides, which have been used
   extensively or selectively both in agricultural and non-agricultural
   areas worldwide for more than fifty years to control broadleaf and some
   grassy weeds. As a consequence of their massive application, they have
   become and remain significant environmental pollutants, especially in
   aquatic ecosystems. Fish are an integral part of the aquatic environment
   and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the behavioral,
   biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have
   summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in
   order to provide an overview of current information on triazines. The
   overall effects of triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish
   were evaluated by considering a variety of parameters in a number of
   reports. Haematological and biochemical profiles of blood provide
   important information about the internal environment of the organism and
   the general physiology and health status of triazine exposed fish.
   According to studies using biotransformation and bioaccumulation indices
   to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in fish metabolism
   reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The
   responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure
   could be an adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced
   oxidative stress. Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or
   reproductive development in fish; however, some triazines did not affect
   fish behavior during long-term exposure to low concentrations.
   Nevertheless, an impact on the overall behavioral response of fish
   cannot be excluded.},

Abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ) is a herbicide worldwide used. That can cause oxidative
   damage in non-target organisms, such as fish. Furthermore, the threat of
   exposure to pesticides together with poor nutrition is hazardous to the
   normal development of fish, and supplementation of the fish diet with
   antioxidants compounds is an alternative approach to prevent the
   hazardous effects of pesticide exposure. Here we aimed to investigate
   the capacity of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) diet supplementation to
   improve the antioxidant defense of Cyprinus carpio (carp) exposed to
   environmental concentrations of ATZ. To prove the efficiency of
   (PhSe)(2), we used the Integrated Biomarkers Response (IBR) methodology.
   Therefore, carp were fed for 8 weeks diets either with or without
   (PhSe)(2) and exposed to 2 or 10 mu g/L of ATZ for 96 h, euthanized, and
   their liver, gills, and muscle tissues were removed for biochemical
   assays. ATZ was able to cause oxidative damage from reactive species
   production in all tissues of carp, as observed by the increase of lipid

Title = {Fenvalerate triggers Parkinson-like symptom during zebrafish development
   through initiation of autophagy and p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling pathway},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {243},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fenvalerate (FEN), one of the most used synthetic pyrethroids, has the
   potential to interfere with human neural function. , Flowever, far too
   little attention was paid to the mechanism of FEN-induced neurotoxicity.
   Thus we exposed zebrafish to FEN from 4 to 120 h post fertilization
   (hpf), and analyzed the morphology and behavior of zebrafish. Our
   results showed that FEN decreased the survival rate of zebrafish, with
   increased malformation rates and abnormal behaviors. Furthermore, we
   found typical parkinson-like symptoms in FEN-exposed zebrafish with
   increases in parkinson's disease (PD), ubiquitin, and Lewy
   bodies-relevant genes. We also observed the loss of dopaminergic neurons
   in both FEN-exposed zebrafish and PC12 cells, which were all associated
   with PD-like symptoms. Besides, FEN activated autophagy by the enhanced
   expressions of p-mTOR, and LC3-II but the reduction of p62. Further, FEN
   initially activated p-p38 MAPK followed by p-mTOR, which triggered the
   transcription of genes responsible for autophagy process and prompted
   the Lewy bodies neuron generation leading to the PD-like symptoms. This
   process was inhibited by both 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy
   inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK selective inhibitor) in zebrafish
   and PC12 cells. These results suggest that FEN might cause
   parkinson-like symptom during zebrafish development through induction of
   autophagy and activation of p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling pathway. The study
   revealed the potential mechanism of FEN-induced neurotoxicity and should
   give new insights into a significant environmental risk factor of
   developing parkinson's disease. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Little is known about the environmental behavior of fenhexamid (FEN) in
   aquatic ecosystems such as degradation and bioaccumulation, in spite of
   the fact that it is critical for a comprehensive assessment of its
   ecological risks. This study investigated for the first time the
   degradation of FEN in water-sediment systems under both aerobic and
   anaerobic conditions and also bioaccumulation by zebrafish (Danio
   rerio). Water and sediments from different natural waters including
   river HR and lake HL were applied to build up water-sediment microcosms
   in the laboratory. When FEN was introduced into the aqueous phase, it
   would partition from water to sediment gradually and be decomposed in
   sediment compartment. The dissipation half-lives of FEN in water were
   43.8, 75.9, 31.3, and 37.2 days for HR-aerobic, HR-anaerobic,
   HL-aerobic, and HL-anaerobic microcosms, respectively. Moreover, FEN
   degradation rate constants of whole systems varied from 0.0045 to 0.0088
   per day and the half-lives were from 78.4 to 155 days. The aerobic
   circumstances were demonstrated to be favor of FEN degradation. The
   bioconcentration factor (BCF) was 2.6-3.1 obtained from zebrafish
   exposure experiments at environmentally relevant concentrations.
   Clearly, our results indicated that FEN could be accumulated in the
   deeper layer of sediment owing to the anaerobic condition against FEN
   degradation, but FEN showed a low potential for bioaccumulation. These
   may aid in comprehensive understanding the fate and risk of FEN in
   aquatic environment.},

   zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {163-170},

Abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ) and its main chlorometabolites, i.e.,
   diaminochlorotriazine (DACT), deisopropylatrazine (DIP), and
   deethylatrazine (DE), have been widely detected in aquatic systems near
   agricultural fields. However, their possible effects on aquatic animals
   are still not fully understood. In this study, it was observed that
   several developmental endpoints such as the heart beat, hatchability,
   and morphological abnormalities were influenced by ATZ and its
   metabolites in different developmental stages. In addition, after 5 days
   of exposure to 30, 100, 300 mu g L-1 ATZ and its main chlorometabolites,
   the swimming behaviors of larval zebrafish were significantly disturbed,
   and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were consistently
   inhibited. Our results also demonstrate that ATZ and its main
   chlorometabolites are neuroendocrine disruptors that impact the
   expression of neurotoxicity-related genes such as Ache, Gap43, Gfap,
   Syn2a, Shha, Mbp, Elavl3, Nestin and Ngn1 in early developmental stages
   of zebrafish. According to our results, it is possible that not only ATZ
   but also its metabolites (DACT, DIP and DE) have the same or even more
   toxic effects on different endpoints of the early developmental stages
   of zebrafish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   behavior of diniconazole in zebrafish were both evaluated to perform an

   examination showed that the swell and vacuolization in the liver, as
   well as the reduction of spermatids in the diniconazole exposure groups.
   No enantioselectivity was observed in the bioaccumulation process of
   both 70 and 300 mu g L-1 diniconazole exposure groups. The above results

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {76},
Number = {7},
Pages = {907-914},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The use of a very effective insecticide against sucking pests,
   neonicotinoid imidacloprid, has been increasing extensively. For this
   reason elevated concentrations are expected in aquatic environment.
   Despite this fact, there is still a lack of data available on its
   possible risk for the environment. In this study, the potential hazards
   of imidacloprid and its commercial product Confidor SL 200 to aquatic
   environment were identified by the acute and chronic toxicity assessment
   using bacteria Vibrio fischeri, algae Desmodesmus subspicatus,
   crustacean Daphnia magna, fish Danio, rerio and the ready
   biodegradability determination. We found out, that imidacloprid was not
   highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other
   environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among
   the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most
   sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and
   long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the
   intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical
   grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase
   of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities
   of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids
   were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial
   product. Imidacloprid was found persistent in water samples and not
   readily biodegradable in aquatic environment. Due to increased future
   predicted use of commercial products containing imidacloprid and the
   findings of this work, we recommend additional toxicity and
   biodegradability studies of other commercial products with imidacloprid
   as an active constituent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {256},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mepanipyrim is a widely used fungicide, and residues of mepanipyrim are
   frequently detected in commodities. However, the neurotoxicity and
   underlying mechanisms of mepanipyrim are still insufficiently
   understood. In this study, zebrafish embryos at 0.5-1.0
   post-fertilization hours (hpf) were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L
   mepanipyrim for 7 days. Our results showed that mepanipyrim could cause
   the locomotor hyperactivity and increase the concentration of
   gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and the Na+/K+- and Ca2+-ATPase
   activities in zebrafish larvae. We have conducted the RNA-sequence and
   RT-qPCR to analyze the gene expressions. The mRNA expression levels of
   calcium/sodium ion conduction associated genes were observably
   up-regulated, demonstrating that mepanipyrim could enhance the cell
   energy metabolism, the synaptic transmission and skeletal muscle
   contraction, which were consistent with the locomotor hyperactivity.
   Meanwhile, exposure to mepanipyrim could significantly change the gene
   expression levels of gad1, bdnf, nlgn1, and type A and B GABA receptors
   in zebrafish larvae. This is the first study focusing on the underlying
   mechanisms of the neurotoxic effects that are induced by mepanipyrim.

Abstract = {In this study, we determined the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of
   carbamate insecticide carbaryl to flounder gill (FG) cells and its
   teratogenicity to zebrafish embryos. The cytotoxicity of carbaryl to FG
   cells was determined with methods including MTT and neutral red uptaking
   (NRU), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) releasing and Hoechst 33342 and
   propidium idodide (PI) double staining. Moderate cytotoxicity in a
   concentration-dependent manner was observed. The 24 h-IC50 value of
   53.48 +/- 1.21, 59.13 +/- 1.19 and 46.21 +/- 1.24 mg L-1 carbaryl was
   obtained through MTT, NRU and LDH assays, respectively. Double
   fluorescence staining demonstrated that carbaryl induced the death of FG
   cells mainly through necrosis. There was no significant genotoxicity
   found in the FG cells exposed to the highest testing concentration of
   carbaryl (20 mg L-1, P > 0.05) as was demonstrated by Comet assay.
   Zebrafish embryos exposed to carbaryl at concentrations a parts per
   thousand yen10 mg L-1 displayed moderate toxic effects on the survival,
   spontaneous movement, hatching, heart rates of the embryos and their
   development, which were evidenced by yolk and pericardial sac edemas,
   body length reduction and tail flexure in time- and
   concentration-dependent manners at specific stages. The 24 h-, 48 h- and
   96 h-LC50 values of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos were 41.80 +/- 1.10,
   17.80 +/- 1.04 and 14.46 +/- 1.05 mg L-1, respectively. These results
   suggested that carbaryl is moderately toxic to FG cells cultured in
   vitro and zebrafish embryos, and the FG cells were similar to zebrafish
   embryos in their sensitivity to carbaryl as 24 h-IC50 and LC50
   indicated.},

Title = {A Critical Review of Zebrafish Models of Parkinson's Disease},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {A wide variety of human diseases have been modelled in zebrafish,
   including various types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and
   neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Recent
   reviews have summarized the currently available zebrafish models of
   Parkinson's Disease, which include gene-based, chemically induced and
   chemogenetic ablation models. The present review updates the literature,
   critically evaluates each of the available models of Parkinson's Disease
   in zebrafish and compares them with similar models in invertebrates and
   mammals to determine their advantages and disadvantages. We examine
   gene-based models, including ones linked to Early-Onset Parkinson's
   Disease: PARKIN, PINK1, DJ-1, and SNCA; but we also examine LRRK2, which
   is linked to Late-Onset Parkinson's Disease. We evaluate chemically
   induced models like MPTP, 6-OHDA, rotenone and paraquat, as well as
   chemogenetic ablation models like metronidazole-nitroreductase. The
   article also reviews the unique advantages of zebrafish, including the
   abundance of behavioural assays available to researchers and the
   efficiency of high-throughput screens. This offers a rare opportunity
   for assessing the potential therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological
   interventions. Zebrafish also are very amenable to genetic manipulation
   using a wide variety of techniques, which can be combined with an array
   of advanced microscopic imaging methods to enable in vivo visualization
   of cells and tissue. Taken together, these factors place zebrafish on
   the forefront of research as a versatile model for investigating disease
   states. The end goal of this review is to determine the benefits of
   using zebrafish in comparison to utilising other animals and to consider
   the limitations of zebrafish for investigating human disease.},

Abstract = {This study is to investigate the behavioural responses of zebrafish to
   the toxic effects of waterborne zinc and chromium(VI). Swimming
   performance of fish was tracked by a real-time toxicity biomonitoring
   system and transformed into data to calculate individual and fish school
   behavioural endpoints. Behavioural responses under metals were in
   accordance with the Stepwise Behavioural Response model. Significant and
   concentrationdependent effects on swimming speed and turning times were
   found at concentrations equal to or higher than 3.5 mg L-1 for zinc and
   0.7 mg L-1 for chromium. Swimming height significantly declined in
   concentrations equal to or higher than 3.5 mg L-1 under zinc exposure,
   while for the chromium treatment, it significantly increased in lower
   concentration exposures and decreased in higher concentration exposures.
   Average distance and dispersion of fish school decreased at the
   beginning but there were no obvious changes during the whole exposure
   period. Behavioural responses under metal exposures were timedependent:
   avoidance (increased speed and turning times and decreased average
   distance and dispersion) might be the first response and followed by
   height changes. Changes in behavioural endpoints `swimming speed and
   height' can be used as early stress responses for acute aquatic metal
   contamination as part of ecological risk assessment.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1802-1810},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Assessing how endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) affect population
   dynamics requires tracking males and females (and sex-reversed
   individuals) separately. A key component in any sex-specific model is
   the ``mating function{''} (the relationship between sex ratio and
   reproductive success) but this relationship is not known for any fish
   species. Using a model, we found that EDC effects on fish populations
   strongly depend upon the shape of the mating function. Additionally,
   masculinization is generally more detrimental to populations than
   feminization. We then quantified the mating function for the inland
   silverside (Menidia beryllina), and used those results and the model to
   assess the status of wild silverside populations. Contrary to the
   expectation that a few males can spawn with many females, silversides
   exhibited a nearly linear mating function. This implies that small
   changes in the sex ratio will reduce reproductive success. Four out of
   five wild silverside populations exhibited sex ratios far from 50:50 and
   thus are predicted to be experiencing population declines. Our results
   suggest that managers should place more emphasis on mitigating
   masculinizing rather than feminizing EDC effects. However, for species
   with a nearly linear mating function, such as Menidia, feminization and
   masculinization are equally detrimental.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe toxicological characterization of sediments is an
   essential task to monitor the quality of aquatic environments. Many
   hazardous pollutants may accumulate in sediments and pose a risk to the
   aquatic community. The present study provides an attempt to integrate a
   diagnostic whole mixture assessment workflow based on a slightly
   modified Danio rerio embryo acute toxicity test with chemical
   characterization. Danio rerio embryos were directly exposed to sieved
   sediment (63m) for 96h. Sediment samples were collected from three
   polluted sites (Kramfors, Sundsvall and ornskoldsvik) in the Gulf of
   Bothnia (Sweden) which are characterized by a long history of pulp and
   paper industry impact. Effect data were supported by chemical analyses
   of 237 organic pollutants and 30 trace elements.ResultsThe results show
   that malformations and neurotoxic compounds are the main drivers of
   differentiation in chemical and effects analyses, respectively. Specific
   spinal cord malformations and delayed hatching were observed only in
   sediments from Kramfors while light hyperactivity was seen only after
   exposure to sediments from Sundsvall.ConclusionsOur experiments
   demonstrate that specific chemical profiles lead to specific effect
   patterns in Danio rerio embryos. In fact, behavioral endpoints could
   help detect the exposure to neurotoxins, and the observation of body
   malformations seems to be a potential tool for the identification of
   site-specific pollutants as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), brominated
   flame retardants (BFRs) and several pesticides. Overall, results show
   the suitability of Danio rerio embryos for the fast screening of
   sediment samples.},

Title = {Age matters: Developmental stage of Danio rerio larvae influences
   photomotor response thresholds to diazinion or diphenhydramine},

Abstract = {Because basic toxicological data is unavailable for the majority of
   industrial compounds, High Throughput Screening (HTS) assays using the
   embryonic and larval zebrafish provide promising approaches to define
   bioactivity profiles and identify potential adverse outcome pathways for
   previously understudied chemicals. Unfortunately, standardized
   approaches, including HTS experimental designs, for examining fish
   behavioral responses to contaminants are rarely available. In the
   present study, we examined movement behavior of larval zebrafish over 7
   days (4-10 days post fertilization or dpf) during typical daylight
   workday hours to determine whether intrinsic activity differed with age
   and time of day. We then employed an early life stage approach using the
   Fish Embryo Test (FET) at multiple developmental ages to evaluate
   whether photomotor response (PMR) behavior differed with zebrafish age
   following exposure to diazinon (DZN), a well-studied orthophosphate
   insecticide, and diphenhydramine (DPH), an antihistamine that also
   targets serotonin reuptake transporters and the acetylcholine receptor.
   72 h studies were conducted at 1-4, 4-7 and 7-10 dpf, followed by
   behavioral observations using a ViewPoint system at 4, 7 and 10 dpf.
   Distance traveled and swimming speeds were quantified; nominal treatment
   levels were analytically verified by isotope-dilution LC-MSMS. Larval
   zebrafish locomotion displayed significantly different (p < 0.05)
   activity profiles over the course of typical daylight and workday hours,
   and these time of day PMR activity profiles were similar across ages
   examined (4-10 dpf). 10 dpf zebrafish larvae were consistently more
   sensitive to DPH than either the 4 or 7 dpf larvae with an
   environmentally realistic lowest observed effect concentration of 200
   ng/L. Though ELS and FET studies with zebrafish typically focus on
   mortality or teratogenicity in 0-4 dpf organisms, behavioral responses
   of slightly older fish were several orders of magnitude more sensitive
   to DPH. Our observations highlight the importance of understanding the
   influence of time of day on intrinsic locomotor activity, and the
   age-specific hazards of aquatic contaminants to fish behavior. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Glyphosate, an herbicide used worldwide, has emerged as a pollutant.
   However, its toxic effects are debated by regulatory authorities.
   Therefore, it is essential to keep the use of such chemicals under
   continuous observation, and their effects must be re-evaluated. We used
   zebrafish embryos to evaluate the toxic effects of glyphosate and its
   mechanisms. We found that glyphosate induced significant toxicity in a
   time and concentration-dependent manner. We observed an LD50 of 66.04
   +/- 4.6 mu g/mL after 48 h of exposure. Glyphosate significantly reduced
   the heartbeat in a time and concentration-dependent manner indicating
   cardiotoxicity. Selective downregulation of Cacanal1C (L-type calcium
   channel) and ryr2a (Ryanodine receptor) genes along with selective
   upregulation of hspb11 (heat shock protein) gene was observed upon
   exposure to glyphosate indicating alterations in the calcium signaling.
   A reduction in the nitric oxide (NO) generation was also observed in the
   zebrafish embryos upon exposure to glyphosate.
   Our results indicate that glyphosate induces significant toxicity
   including cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos in a time and
   concentration-dependent manner. Further, cardiotoxicity may be due to
   changes in calcium and NO signaling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Neurotoxicological Profiling of Paraquat in Zebrafish Model},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Paraquat is a polar herbicide protecting plant products against invasive
   species, it requires careful manipulation and restricted usage because
   of its harmful potentials. Exposure to paraquat triggers oxidative
   damage in dopaminergic neurons and subsequently causes a behavioral
   defect in vivo. Thereby, persistent exposure to paraquat is known to
   increase Parkinson's disease risk by dysregulating dopaminergic systems
   in humans. Therefore, most studies have focused on the dopaminergic
   systems to elucidate the neurotoxicological mechanism of paraquat
   poisoning, and more comprehensive neurochemistry including
   histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems has
   remained unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the
   toxicological potential of paraquat poisoning using a variety of
   approaches such as toxicokinetic profiles, behavioral effects, neural
   activity, and broad-spectrum neurochemistry in zebrafish larvae after
   short-term exposure to paraquat and we performed the molecular modeling
   approach. Our results showed that paraquat was slowly absorbed in the
   brain of zebrafish after oral administration of paraquat. In addition,
   paraquat toxicity resulted in behavioral impairments, namely, reduced
   motor activity and led to abnormal neural activities in zebrafish
   larvae. This locomotor deficit came with a dysregulation of dopamine
   synthesis induced by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity,
   which was also indirectly confirmed by molecular modeling studies.
   Furthermore, short-term exposure to paraquat also caused simultaneous
   dysregulation of other neurochemistry including cholinergic and
   serotonergic systems in zebrafish larvae. The present study suggests
   that this neurotoxicological profiling could be a useful tool for
   understanding the brain neurochemistry of neurotoxic agents that might
   be a potential risk to human and environmental health.},

Title = {Isoprocarb causes neurotoxicity of zebrafish embryos through oxidative
   stress-induced apoptosis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {242},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Isoprocarb is a widely used carbamate insecticide in agriculture and
   aquaculture. Overuse of isoprocarb always leaves toxic residues in soil
   and water, however, the potential ecotoxicity of isoprocarb to organisms
   is still confusing. In this study, zebrafish embryo was used as a model
   to evaluate the toxicity of isoprocarb. Zebrafish embryos (96 hpf) were
   separately exposed at different concentrations of isoprocarb. The
   mortality rate, hatch-ability rate, average heart beat of the zebrafish
   embryo were separately calculated. Our results suggested that exposure
   to isoprocarb induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. HE
   staining showed that exposure to isoprocarb caused developmental defect
   in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos. As expected, the behavioral
   analysis also showed that the motor ability of zebrafish embryos were
   significantly inhibited following exposure to isoprocarb. In terms of
   mechanism, The expressions of genes involved in neurodevelopment
   signaling path-ways, such as foxo3a, gfap, syn2a, elavl3 and sox19b,
   were inhibited in zebrafish embryos after exposure to isoprocarb. The
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also reduced in
   isoprocarb-treated zebrafish embryos. Moreover, oxidative stress was
   induced by increasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and
   decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme (SOD) after exposure to
   isoprocarb. Expectedly, acridine orange (AO) staining and the detection
   of some apoptosis-related genes revealed that oxidative stress resulted
   in apoptosis. In short, the expressions of genes associated with the
   neurodevelopmental signaling pathway are inhibited, and oxidative stress
   is also induced in zebrafish embryos after exposure to isoprocarb, which
   may be the molecular basics of isoprocarb-induced neurotoxicity in
   zebrafish embryos.},

   Rotenone is a neurotoxin that is used to induce experimental PD model.
   Rotenone inhibits mitochondrial respiratory complex 1 (MRC1) and causes

   molecular perspective on the global phosphoproteome differences in
   rotenone-exposed zebrafish treated with octanoic acid. Raw files
   obtained from MS analysis were processed and searched against the Danio
   rerio protein database using SEQUEST-HT algorithm to identify and
   quantify phosphopeptides with 2,569 unique phosphoproteins and 4,161
   unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 2005 proteins.
   Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) family members were significantly

   (calcium, magnesium, zinc ion), oxygen binding, microtubule binding,
   ATP- and GTP-binding were among differentially expressed 347 proteins in

   Phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites were identified for future
   exploration of signaling pathways involved in rotenone toxicity. We
   believe our findings might help in the formulation of effective

Abstract = {Organophosphates are a class of highly toxic chemicals that includes
   many pesticides and chemical weapons. Exposure to organophosphates,
   either through accidents or acts of terrorism, poses a significant risk
   to human health and safety. Existing antidotes, in use for over 50
   years, have modest efficacy and undesirable toxicities. Therefore,
   discovering new organophosphate antidotes is a high priority. Early life
   stage zebrafish exposed to organophosphates exhibit several phenotypes
   that parallel the human response to organophosphates, including
   behavioral deficits, paralysis, and eventual death. Here, we have
   developed a high-throughput zebrafish screen in a 96-well plate format
   to find new antidotes that counteract organophosphate-induced lethality.
   In a pilot screen of 1200 known drugs, we identified 16 compounds that
   suppress organophosphate toxicity in zebrafish. Several in vitro assays
   coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based
   metabolite profiling enabled determination of mechanisms of action for
   several of the antidotes, including reversible acetylcholinesterase
   inhibition, cholinergic receptor antagonism, and inhibition of
   bioactivation. Therefore, the in vivo screen is capable of discovering
   organophosphate antidotes that intervene in distinct pathways. These
   findings suggest that zebrafish screens might be a broadly applicable
   approach for discovering compounds that counteract the toxic effects of
   accidental or malicious poisonous exposures.},

Abstract = {The improper use of synthetic fungicides has raised public concerns
   related to environmental pollution and animal health. Over the years,
   plant-derived antifungals have been investigated as safer alternatives,
   although little scientific evidence of its neurodevelopmental effects
   exist. The main objective of this study was to explore the effects of
   three alternative natural extracts (Equisetum arvense, Mimosa
   tenuiflora, Thymol) with antifungal properties during the early
   development of zebrafish by evaluating different teratogenic, oxidative
   stress and behavioural outcomes. Following the determination of the 96
   h-LC50, exposure to sublethal concentrations showed the safety profile
   of both E. arvense and M. tenuiflora. However, following 96-h exposure
   to Thymol, increased lethality, pericardial oedema, yolk and eye
   deformations, and decreased body length were observed. The reduced and
   oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratio was increased, and the
   glutathione-s-transferase activity in the group exposed to the highest
   Thymol concentration. Overall, these results support a more reducing
   environment associated with possible effects at the cellular
   proliferation level. In addition, the disruption of behavioural states
   (fear- and anxiety-like disorders) were noted, pointing to alterations
   in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase developmental signalling pathway,
   although further studies are required to explore this rationale.
   Notwithstanding, the results provide direct evidence of the teratogenic
   effects of Thymol, which might have consequences for non-target species.},

Abstract = {Zebrafish Mate7 belongs to solute carrier protein superfamily and
   specifically to subfamily of multidrug and toxin extruders. It is
   co-orthologous to mammalian Mates, and is ubiquitously expressed in
   zebrafish tissues with the highest expression in kidney. It has been
   shown to interact with both endogenous (steroid hormones) and xenobiotic
   compounds (pharmaceuticals), implying a role in efflux of toxic
   compounds. The objective of our study was to analyse interaction of
   environmental contaminants with zebrafish Mate7 using a newly developed
   high throughput screening (HTS) Mate7 assay. A full-length zebrafish
   mate7 sequence was obtained from zebrafish cDNA originating from male
   kidney, and a stable expression of Mate7 in genetically engineered
   HEK293 Flp-In cells was achieved. Stable Mate7 transfectants were then
   used for development and optimization of a new HTS cellular uptake
   protocol, with DAPI and ASP + as model fluorescent substrates. The
   developed assay was used for identifying zebrafish Mate 7 interactors
   and discerning the type of interaction. A series of 89 diverse
   environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides,
   and pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors
   were identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the
   inhibitors identified could be of environmental concern because they may
   potentially impair Mate7 efflux function, lowering the fish defence
   capacity against environmental contaminants, or interfering with
   transport of yet unidentified physiological substrates. In addition, we
   found significant differences between zebrafish Mate7 and mammalian
   Mates' substrate preferences, a finding that should be taken into
   consideration when using zebrafish as a model organism in toxicokinetic
   studies.},

Abstract = {Atrazine (ATR), a widely used herbicide, has been previously shown to
   damage spatial memory capability and the hippocampus of male rats during
   the development. It has also been indicated that physical exercise can
   improve learning and memory in both humans and animals, as a
   neuroprotective method. Our aim here was to investigate the effect of
   maternal ATR exposure during gestation and lactation on spatial learning
   and memory function and hippocampal morphology in offspring and to
   further evaluate the neuroprotective effect of swimming training and
   identify possible related learning and memory signaling pathways. Using
   Sprague-Dawley rats, we examined behavioral and molecular biology
   effects associated with maternal ATR exposure, as well as the effects of
   8 or 28 days swimming training. Maternal exposure to ATR was found to
   impair spatial learning and memory by behavioral test, damage the
   hippocampal morphology, and reduce related genes and proteins expression
   of learning and memory in the hippocampus. The extended, 28 days, period
   of swimming training produced a greater amelioration of the adverse
   effects of ATR exposure than the shorter, 8 days, training period. Our
   results suggest that maternal ATR exposure may damage the spatial
   learning and memory of offspring male rats via PSD95/NR2B signaling
   pathway. The negative effect of ATR could be at least partially reversed
   by swimming training, pointing to a potential neuroprotective role of
   physical exercise in nervous system diseases accompanying by learning

Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY \& PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {239},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Beta-cypermethrin, a type II synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely
   used in pest control. Several studies have demonstrated that
   beta-cypermethrin can affect the reproductive system of mammals.
   However, there is still a scarcity of information about the reproductive
   toxicity to fish induced by beta-cypermethrin and its molecular
   mechanism. Therefore, this study was conducted to address this
   scientific question, in which the adult zebrafish were exposed to 0
   (blank control), 0 (acetone solvent control), 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mu g/L
   of beta-cypermethrin for 21 days. A decrease in cumulative egg
   production of zebrafish was observed, indicating that beta-cypermethrin
   had a negative impact on reproductive capacity of zebrafish. Regarding
   the histomorphological analysis of gonads, the delay of gonadal
   development was observed after exposure for 21 days. In addition,
   significant changes in plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and testosterone
   (T) were found in zebrafish. Further exploration showed that the
   transcription levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)
   axis-related genes were remarkably changed, which corresponded well with
   the alterations of hormone levels. These results demonstrated that
   beta-cypermethrin might have an adverse effect on the reproduction
   system of zebrafish through delaying gonadal development, disturbing sex
   hormone secretion, and affecting HPG axis gene expression. This study
   suggests that beta-cypermethrin poses a potential threat to the
   reproduction of fish populations, and the toxicity assessment of
   beta-cypermethrin plays a vital role in the environmental risk
   assessment of pesticides.},

Abstract = {Cyhalofop-butyl is an aryloxyphenoxypropionate post-emergence herbicide
   widely used around the world in agriculture. The acute toxicity of
   cyhalofop-butyl to embryos, larvae (12 and 72 h post-hatching), and
   adult zebrafish, as well as the short-term developmental toxicity of
   cyhalofop-butyl to embryo and sac-fry stages, was tested. The results
   showed that the 96-h LC50 values of cyhalofop-butyl to embryos, 12 h
   post-hatching larvae, 72 h post-hatching larvae, and adult fish were
   2.03, 0.58, 1.42, and 3.49 mg/L, respectively, suggesting zebrafish
   early life stages were more sensitive to cyhalofop-butyl than adult
   stage. Cyhalofop-butyl would inhibit the spontaneous movement,
   heartbeat, hatching rate of embryos, and the body length of surviving
   larvae of zebrafish at 1.00 mg/L or higher concentrations. Morphological
   abnormalities, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, deformation
   of tail, and deformation of spine, were induced by cyhalofop-butyl. The
   results indicated that cyhalofop-butyl had significant negative impacts
   on zebrafish at different life stages, and spontaneous movement and
   hatching rate were sensitive endpoints for assessing short-term
   developmental toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl.},

Abstract = {A heavy metal, copper, was exposed to indicator species, Daphnia magna
   in fresh water. Response behaviors were accordingly monitored by using
   models for pattern recognition. With computer interfacing techniques
   movement of indicator species was continuously observed in response to
   Cu2+ at low concentrations before (24 hours) and after (24 hours) the
   treatments. The movement tracks in 2-dimension were segmented into a
   short unit (30s). The parameters (e. g., speed, stop number and meander)
   in the movement data were trained with Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to
   classify behavioral patterns under the stressful condition of chemical
   treatments. The patterns in the designated time unit accordingly
   revealed the structural properties of movement data under the chemical
   stress. This study further suggested that models of pattern recognition
   such as SOM could be a useful tool in analyzing complex behavioral
   patterns of indicator species and in monitoring heavy metal exposure in
   environment in situ. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V. Selection

   dysfunction in zebrafish},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease is a heterogeneous and
   highly morbid group of energy deficiency disorders for which no proven
   effective therapies exist. Robust vertebrate animal models of primary RC
   dysfunction are needed to explore the effects of variation in RC disease
   subtypes, tissue-specific manifestations, and major pathogenic factors
   contributing to each disorder, as well as their pre-clinical response to
   therapeutic candidates. We have developed a series of zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) models that inhibit, to variable degrees, distinct aspects of RC
   function, and enable quantification of animal development, survival,
   behaviors, and organ-level treatment effects as well as effects on
   mitochondrial biochemistry and physiology. Here, we characterize four
   pharmacologic inhibitor models of mitochondrial RC dysfunction in early
   larval zebrafish, including rotenone (complex I inhibitor), azide
   (complex IV inhibitor), oligomycin (complex V inhibitor), and
   chloramphenicol (mitochondrial translation inhibitor that leads to
   multiple RC complex dysfunction). A range of concentrations and exposure
   times of each RC inhibitor were systematically evaluated on early larval
   development, animal survival, integrated behaviors (touch and startle
   responses), organ physiology (brain death, neurologic tone, heart rate),
   and fluorescence-based analyses of mitochondrial physiology in zebrafish
   skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic RC inhibitor effects were validated by
   spectrophotometric analysis of Complex I, II and IV enzyme activities,
   or relative quantitation of ATP levels in larvae. Outcomes were
   prioritized that utilize in vivo animal imaging and quantitative
   behavioral assessments, as may optimally inform the translational
   potential of pre-clinical drug screens for future clinical study in
   human mitochondrial disease subjects. The RC complex inhibitors each
   delayed early embryo development, with short-term exposures of these
   three agents or chloramphenicol from 5 to 7 days post fertilization also
   causing reduced larval survival and organ-specific defects ranging from
   brain death, behavioral and neurologic alterations, reduced
   mitochondrial membrane potential in skeletal muscle (rotenone), and/or
   cardiac edema with visible blood pooling (oligomycin). Remarkably, we
   demonstrate that treating animals with probucol, a nutrient-sensing
   signaling network modulating drug that has been shown to yield
   therapeutic effects in a range of other RC disease cellular and animal
   models, both prevented acute rotenone-induced brain death in zebrafish
   larvae, and significantly rescued early embryo developmental delay from
   either rotenone or oligomycin exposure. Overall, these zebrafish
   pharmacologic RC function inhibition models offer a unique opportunity
   to gain novel insights into diverse developmental, survival,
   organ-level, and behavioral defects of varying severity, as well as
   their individual response to candidate therapies, in a highly tractable
   and cost-effective vertebrate animal model system. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {The use of pesticides is a widely spread practice in Brazilian
   agriculture, and dispersion of these substances is an important factor
   for the fauna and flora. Atrazine is an endocrine disruptor in the
   xenoestrogen class that is used worldwide in agricultural practices. In
   Brazil, its use is permitted in several crops. Podocnemis expansa is a
   representative of the Testudines order that is the largest freshwater
   reptile of South America. Its distribution enables it to get in contact
   with molecules that are commonly used as pesticides, which may cause
   deleterious effects in target populations. In order to evaluate the
   possible effects of the exposure to atrazine on bone ontogeny of this
   species, eggs were artificially incubated in sand moistened with water
   contaminated with atrazine at concentrations equal to 0, 2, 20 or 200 mu
   g/L. Embryos were collected throughout incubation and submitted to
   diaphanization of soft tissues with potassium hydroxide (KOH); bones
   were stained with Alizarin red S and cartilages by Alcian blue. Embryos
   were evaluated for the presence of abnormalities during the different
   stages of pre-natal development of skeletal elements. No effect of
   atrazine was observed on bone development during the embryonic phase in
   P. expansa individuals, in the conditions of this study.},

Title = {Exposure to agricultural pesticide impairs visual lateralization in a
   larval coral reef fish},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Lateralization, i.e. the preferential use of one side of the body, may
   convey fitness benefits for organisms within rapidly-changing
   environments, by optimizing separate and parallel processing of
   different information between the two brain hemispheres. In coral
   reef-fishes, the movement of larvae from planktonic to reef environments
   (recruitment) represents a major life-history transition. This
   transition requires larvae to rapidly identify and respond to sensory
   cues to select a suitable habitat that facilitates survival and growth.
   This `recruitment' is critical for population persistence and
   resilience. In aquarium experiments, larval Acanthurus triostegus
   preferentially used their right-eye to investigate a variety of visual
   stimuli. Despite this, when held in in situ cages with predators, those
   larvae that previously favored their left-eye exhibited higher survival.
   These results support the ``brain's righthemisphere{''} theory, which
   predicts that the right-eye (i.e. left-hemisphere) is used to categorize
   stimuli while the left-eye (i.e. right-hemisphere) is used to inspect
   novel items and initiate rapid behavioral-responses. While these
   experiments confirm that being highly lateralized is ecologically
   advantageous, exposure to chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often inadvertently
   added to coral-reef waters, impaired visual-lateralization. This
   suggests that chemical pollutants could impair the brain function of
   larval fishes during a critical life-history transition, potentially
   impacting recruitment success.},

Title = {Developmental toxicity of fenbuconazole in zebrafish: Effects on
   mitochondrial respiration and locomotor behavior},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {470},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Triazole fungicides are used to control the disease of cereal crops but
   may also cause adverse effects on nontarget organisms. There is a lack
   of toxicity data for some triazoles such as fenbuconazole in aquatic
   organisms. This research was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of
   fenbuconazole at environmentally relevant concentrations with attention
   on the mitochondria, antioxidant system, and locomotor activity in
   zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to one concentration of 5, 50, 200 or
   500 ng/L fenbuconazole for 96 h. There was no effect on survival nor
   percentage of fish hatched, but exposure to 200 and 500 ng/L
   fenbuconazole resulted in malformation and hypoactivity in zebrafish.
   Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of embryos were measured to determine if
   the fungicide impaired mitochondrial respiration. Exposure to 500 ng/L
   fenbuconazole reduced basal OCR and oligomycin-induced ATP linked
   respiration in exposed fish. Fenbuconazole reduced mitochondrial
   membrane potential and reduced the activities of mitochondrial Complex
   II and III. Transcript levels of both sdhc and cyc1, each related to
   Complex II and III, were also altered in expression by fenbuconazole
   exposure, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in embryos.
   Fenbuconazole activated the antioxidant system, based upon both
   transcriptional and enzymatic data in zebrafish. Consistent with
   mitochondrial impairment, molecular docking confirmed a strong binding
   capacity of the fungicide at the Q(i) site of Complex III, revealing
   this complex is susceptible to fenbuconazole. This study reveals
   potential toxicity pathways related to fenbuconazole exposure in aquatic
   organisms; such data can improve risk assessments for triazole
   fungicides.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS},
Abstract = {The study investigates nonmodified kenaf cellulose nanofiber (CNF)
   physicochemical properties, loading capability, and its acute toxicity
   against Daphnia magna and Dania rerio concerning the dispersion
   stability behavior of the kenaf CNF as a potential larvicide
   nanocarrier. The physicochemical properties of kenaf CNF were
   characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area and porosity, and
   zeta potential. The loading capability was assessed using various water
   volumes, and the acute ecotoxicity was determined following the
   Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development test guidelines
   Test no. 202 and Test no. 203, respectively. Kenaf CNF is a fibrous high
   aspect ratio nanomaterial comprising a negatively charged hydroxyl group
   with moderate particle stability and high loading capability. With high
   dispersion stability in the freshwater environment's aquatic conditions,
   kenaf CNF did not cause abnormalities and mortality to the D. rerio and
   no acute immobilization against D. magna. The kenaf CNF could be a
   candidate to function as a larvicide nanocarrier with insignificant
   acute ecotoxicity. The EC50 and LC50 for D. magna and D. rerio were
   above 100 mg/L and classified as nonhazardous to the aquatic environment

Title = {A comprehensive review of strobilurin fungicide toxicity in aquatic
   species: Emphasis on mode of action from the zebrafish model},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {275},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Strobilurins are popular fungicides used in agriculture on a global
   scale. Due to their widespread use as agrochemicals, they can enter
   aquatic environments at concentrations that can elicit adverse effects
   in organisms. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge
   regarding the toxic effects of strobilurin fungicides on aquatic
   species, including algal species, Daphnia magna, and fish species, to
   determine risk to aquatic organisms and ecosystems. Data show that the
   toxicities of strobilurins vary widely across aquatic species.
   Strobilurins bind cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial complex III in fungi,
   and as such, research in aquatic species has focused on
   mitochondria-related endpoints following exposures to strobilurins. In
   fish, studies into the activities of mitochondrial complexes and the
   expression of genes involved in the electron transfer chain have been
   conducted, converging on the theme that mitochondrial complexes and
   their enzymes are impaired by strobilurins. In general, the order of
   toxicity of strobilurins for fish species are pyraoxystrobin >
   pyraclostrobin approximate to trifloxystrobin > picoxystrobin >
   kresoxim-methyl > fluoxastrobin > azoxystrobin. In addition to
   mitochondrial toxicity, studies also report genotoxicity,
   immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption,
   and each of these events can potentially impact whole organism-level
   processes such as development, reproduction, and behavior. Screening
   data from the US Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast database
   supports the hypothesis that these fungicides may act as endocrine
   disruptors, and high throughput data suggest estrogen receptor alpha and
   thyroid hormone receptor beta can be activated by some strobilurins. It
   is recommended that studies investigate the potential for endocrine
   disruption by strobilurins more thoroughly in aquatic species. Based on
   molecular, physiological, and developmental outcomes, a proposed adverse
   outcome pathway is presented with complex III inhibition in the electron
   transfer chain as a molecular initiating event. This review
   comprehensively addresses sub-lethal toxicity mechanisms of strobilurin
   fungicides, important as the detection of strobilurins in aquatic
   environments suggests exposure risks in wildlife. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Common environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides
   pose serious risks to behavioral and neuroendocrine functions of many
   aquatic organisms. In the present study, we show that the heavy metal
   cadmium and the pesticide endosulfan produce such effects through an
   interaction of specific cerebral histamine receptor subtypes in the
   teleost ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo). Treatment of this teleost with
   toxic cadmium levels for 1 week was sufficient to induce abnormal
   swimming movements, whereas reduced feeding behaviors were provoked
   predominantly by elevated endosulfan concentrations. In the brain, these
   environmental contaminants caused neuronal degeneration in cerebral
   targets such as the mesencephalon and hypothalamus, damage that appeared
   to correlate with altered binding levels of the three major histamine
   receptors (subtypes 1, 2, and 3). Although cadmium accounted for reduced
   binding activity of all three subtypes in most brain regions, it was
   subtype 2 that seemed to be its main target, as shown by a very great (p
   < 0.001) down-regulation in mesencephalic areas such as the stratum
   griseum central layer. Conversely, endosulfan provided very great and
   great (p < 0.01) up-regulating effects of subtype 3 and I levels,
   respectively, in preoptic-hypothalamic areas such as the medial part of
   the lateral tuberal nucleus, and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These
   results suggest that the neurotoxicant-dependent abnormal motor and
   feeding behaviors may well be tightly linked to binding activities of
   distinct histamine subtypes in localized brain regions of the Thalassoma
   pavo.},

   Behavioral measurements indicate that TDCIPP exposure significantly
   elevated spontaneous movement, and altered swimming behavior response of
   larvae to both light and dark stimulation. Interestingly, in accordance
   with these motor effects, TDCIPP significantly decreased expression of
   the neuron-specific GFP in transgenic (HuC-GFP) zebrafish larvae as well
   as decreased expression of the neural marker genes elavl3 and ngnl,
   inhibited the axonal growth of the secondary motoneurons and altered the
   expressions of axon-related genes (alpha l-tubtdin, shha and netrin2) in
   zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, TDCIPP exposure at 900 mu g/L
   significantly increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
   enzyme, and decreased the total acetylcholine (ACh) concentration. Our
   data indicate that the alteration in motor neuron and inhibition of

   esters in zebrafish embryos},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {401},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Many toxicological studies have utilized zebrafish embryos to
   investigate the developmental toxicity of organophosphate esters (OPEs).
   However, in respect of the presence or absence of the chorion, a
   consistent experimental methodology has yet to be developed. In this
   study, we used a fixed exposure scheme to compare the developmental
   toxicities of six major OPEs in chorionated and dechorionated zebrafish
   embryos. Removal of the chorion increased sensitivity to OPEs: we found
   higher incidence of mortality and malformation in dechorionated embryos.
   In a behavioral assay, the locomotive activity of zebrafish larvae was
   consistently inhibited by OPEs except tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate
   regardless of chorion presence. However, at the molecular level, the
   expression of ZHE1 and mmp9 was affected by the presence of the chorion
   in zebrafish embryos exposed to tributyl phosphate and triphenyl
   phosphate (TPHP), respectively. Furthermore, in zebrafish embryos
   exposed to TPHP, the increased expression of miR-137 and miR-141 was
   abolished by the presence of the chorion. Our results demonstrate for
   the first time that the presence of the chorion influences phenotypic
   morbidity, organismal behavior, and gene expression in zebrafish embryos
   exposed to chemicals; thus, we suggest that dechorionation is desirable
   for exploring the toxicity mechanisms that underlie effects of chemical
   exposure.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate (GLY) induces developmental toxicity in fish, but research on
   the toxicity mechanism is limited. In this study, zebrafish embryos were
   exposed for 120 hpf to 0.7, 7, and 35 mg L-1 GLY. The results show that
   GLY treatment induced developmental toxicity in the fish, including
   premature hatching, reduced heartbeats, pericardial and yolk sac oedema,
   swim bladder deficiency, and shortened body length, which was possibly
   due to a significantly decreased triiodothyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4)
   ratio and the abnormal expression patterns of
   hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) (crh, tsh beta, tr alpha, tr beta,
   and t tr ) and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF)
   axis-related genes (gh, ghr alpha, ghr beta, igf1, igf1r alpha, and
   igf1r beta) in larvae exposed to GLY. In addition, GLY exposure altered
   the levels of SOD and CAT, increased ROS, promoted malondialdehyde (MDA)
   content, and significantly altered the levels of endoplasmic reticulum
   (ER) stress signalling pathway factors (perk, eif2 alpha, gadd34, atf4,
   ire1 alpha, xbp1, atf6, hspa5, and chop), suggesting that GLY treatment
   induced oxidative injury and ER stress in the larvae. Further research
   showed that treatment with a higher concentration of GLY upregulated the
   levels of iNOS, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha while inhibiting the expression
   of IL-10 and TGF-beta, suggesting that GLY causes an inflammatory
   reaction in the larvae. In addition, we also found that apoptosis was
   induced in the larvae, which was determined by acridine orange staining
   and abnormal expression of p53, caspase-3,-8, and-9. Taken together, our
   results demonstrate that GLY exposure altered the T3/T4 ratio, disturbed
   the expression patterns of HPT and GH/IGF axis-related genes, and
   induced oxidative and ER stress, inflammatory reactions, and apoptosis
   in the zebrafish larvae. This investigation contributes to improved
   understanding of the developmental toxicity mechanism of GLY in fish.},

Abstract = {Brazil is a global agricultural commodity producer and the largest
   consumer of pesticides. Pesticide use in Brazil comprised 549 280 tons
   in 2018. In the country, soybean, corn, and sugar cane are extensively
   produced, which are the most pesticides demanding crops. In the last
   years, the records of new pesticides were the highest in the historical
   series. They can persist in soil or water, accumulate in organisms, and
   contaminate workers and the general population through the air, water,
   or food. This review aimed to gather toxicological data obtained by
   animal models exposed to 4 pesticides: glyphosate, chlorpyrifos,
   abamectin, and 2,4-D. An additional goal was to compose an overview of
   how this subject has been approached, surveying which research groups
   are working on this field, where they are located, and relations with
   pesticides used in those regions. We collected the papers from the
   platforms PubMed, Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science, performed in
   Brazil from 2014 to 2019. After two-step blind selection using the
   software Rayyan QCRI by different authors, 67 studies were selected to
   extract data. We observed that research is more concentrated in the
   South region, followed by the Southeast and Midwest, with 43\%, 32\%,
   and 23\% of the studies, respectively. The prevalent institutions are
   from the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo, and Goias. The effects
   on a variety of biomarkers help predict the potential risks to humans
   and nontarget organisms. The prevalent animal model was fish (36\%).
   Overall, the main toxic effects evaluated were mortality, abnormalities
   in the blood cells, developmental abnormalities, and behavior
   alterations. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;00:1-14. (c) 2020 SETAC},

Abstract = {Chirality is a critical topic in the medicinal and agrochemical fields.
   One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion
   has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over
   time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the
   enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since
   early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in
   biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present
   review, we highlight state-of-the knowledge on the stereoselective
   biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms
   ranging from invertebrates to humans. Chiral insecticides, fungicides,
   and herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pharmaceuticals, flame
   retardants hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and perfluorooctane sulfonate
   (PFOS) are all included in the target compounds. Key findings included:
   a) Changes in the enantiomeric fractions in vitro and in vivo models
   revealed that enantioselectivity commonly occurs in biotransformation
   and bioaccumulation. b) Emerging contaminants have become more important
   in the field of enantioselectivity together with their metabolites in
   biological transformation process. c) Chiral signatures have also been
   regarded as powerful tools for tracking pollution sources when the
   contribution of precursor is unknown. Future studies are needed in order
   to understand not only preliminary enrichment results but also detailed
   molecular mechanisms in diverse models to comprehensively understand the
   behaviours of chiral compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Does time difference of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition in

Abstract = {In order to illustrate time difference in toxic effects of cadmium
   chloride (CdCl2) and deltamethrin (DM), AChE activities were measured in
   different tissues, liver, muscle, brain, and gill, of Zebra fish (Danio
   rerio) across different concentrations in this research. The average
   AChE activity decreased comparing to 0.0 TU with DM (82.81\% in 0.1 TU,
   56.14\% in 1.0 TU and 44.68\% in 2.0 TU) and with CdCl2 (74.68\% in 0.1
   TU, 52.05\% in 1.0 TU and 50.14\% in 2.0 TU) showed an overall decrease
   with the increase of exposure concentrations. According to
   Self-Organizing Map (SOM), the AChE activities were characterized in
   relation with experimental conditions, showing an inverse relationship
   with exposure time. As the exposure time was longer, the AChE activities
   were correspondingly lower. The AChE inhibition showed time delay in
   sublethal treatments (0.1 TU) in different tissues: the AChE was first
   inhibited in brain by chemicals followed by gill, muscle and liver
   (brain > gill > muscle > liver). The AChE activity was almost inhibited
   synchronously in higher environmental stress (1.0 TU and 2.0 TU). As the
   AChE inhibition can induce abnormal of behavior movement, these results
   will be helpful to the mechanism of stepwise behavior responses
   according to the time difference in different tissues rather than the
   whole body AChE activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study focused on the short-term whole organism bioassays (WOBs) on
   fish (Danio rerio) and crustaceans (Gammarus fossarum and Daphnia magna)
   to assess the negative biological effects of water from the major
   European River Sava and the comparison of the obtained results with in
   vitro toxicity data (ToxCast database) and Risk Quotient (RQ)
   methodology. Pollution profiles of five sampling sites along the River
   Sava were assessed by simultaneous chemical analysis of 562 organic
   contaminants (OCs) of which 476 were detected. At each sampling site,
   pharmaceuticals/illicit drugs category was mostly represented by their
   cumulative concentration, followed by categories industrial chemicals,
   pesticides and hormones. An exposure-activity ratio (EAR) approach based
   on ToxCast data highlighted steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
   antibiotics, antiepileptics/neuroleptics, industrial chemicals and
   hormones as compounds with the highest biological potential. Summed
   EAR-based prediction of toxicity showed a good correlation with the
   estimated toxicity of assessed sampling sites using WOBs. WOBs did not
   exhibit increased mortality but caused various sub-lethal biological
   responses that were dependant relative to the sampling site pollution
   intensity as well as species sensitivity. Exposure of G. fossarum and D.
   magna to river water-induced lower feeding rates increased GST activity
   and TBARS levels. Zebrafish D. rerio embryo exhibited a significant
   decrease in heartbeat rate, failure in pigmentation formation, as well
   as inhibition of ABC transporters. Nuclear receptor activation was
   indicated as the biological target of greatest concern based on the EAR
   approach. A combined approach of short-term WOBs, with a special
   emphasis on sublethal endpoints, and chemical characterization of water
   samples compared against in vitro toxicity data from the ToxCast
   database and RQs can provide a comprehensive insight into the negative
   effect of pollutants on aquatic organisms.},

Abstract = {Purpose: In recent years, the increase in the biopesticides synthesis
   for alternative agricultural uses has required their impacts study.
   Among these compounds, several of them are known to exert
   endocrinedisrupting (EDs) effects causing deregulation of physiological
   functions affecting cell signaling pathways involved in neural cell
   differentiation leading to developmental neurotoxicity. The objective of
   our study was to determine the impact of the biopesticide A6
   structurally related to estrogenic EDs on zebrafish larvae, to define
   its toxicity, the mechanisms responsible, and to monitor the locomotors
   activity at nanomolar concentrations (0. 0.5, 5 and 50 nM). Materials
   and methods: Using imaging analysis tools, immunohistochemistry,
   quantitative PCR, and an automated behavior recording system (Zebrabox)
   we were able to assess these effects. Results: We have shown through its
   blue fluorescence properties that it accumulates in different parts of
   the body such as the intestine, adipose tissue, muscles, yolk sac and
   head. A6 also disrupted swimming behavior by affecting the expression of
   tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in dopaminergic neurons. Conclusions: In
   conclusion, our study provided a mechanistic understanding of the A6
   neurotoxic effect which could be the result of its binding to the

Title = {Toxicity of clomazone and its formulations to zebrafish embryos (Danio

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {188},
Pages = {54-63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Herbicides are the most widely used group of pesticides but after
   reaching water bodies they are able to cause adverse effects on
   non-target organisms. Different formulations using the same active
   ingredient are frequently available, which raises the issue of potential
   influence of different formulation types on herbicide toxicity. The
   present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic effects of the
   active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampe (R) EC and
   GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish
   embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the
   way of active substance release. This investigation is the first report
   on zebrafish embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The
   technical active ingredient and formulations caused mortality and
   diverse teratogenic effects, showing different levels of toxicity. The
   LC50 values for the technical ingredient, Rampa (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36
   CS were 61.4, 9.6 and 92.5 mg a.i./l, respectively. Spontaneous
   movements in 22 hpf embryos decreased under exposure to both the
   technical ingredient and formulations. A significant number of
   underdeveloped embryos was detected after exposure to clomazone and
   Rampe EC, while no underdevelopment was noted in embryos exposed to GAT
   Cenit 36 CS. Exposure to the technical ingredient and formulations led
   also to a series of morphological changes and interfered with the growth
   of zebrafish embryos. The EC50 based on detection of edemas, spine and
   tail tip deformations and gas bladder absence (120 hpf) was 12.1, 10.1
   and 24.1 mg/l for technical clomazone, Rampe EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS,
   while teratogenicity index (TI) based on LC50/EC50 ratio was 5.1, 1 and
   3.8, respectively. The data in this study showed that the emulsifiable
   concentrate formulation (Rampa. EC) caused statistically significantly
   higher toxicity, and the aqueous capsule suspension (GAT Cenit 36 CS)
   lower toxicity than technical clomazone. It indicates that different
   formulations with the same active ingredient may have different
   environmental impacts, which is why risk assessment based only on active
   ingredient toxicity might not be sufficient in terms of preventing
   formulation effects on the environment.},

Abstract = {Deltamethrin (DLM) is a widely used and highly effective insecticide.
   DLM exposure is harmful to animal and human. Quail, as a bird model, has
   been widely used in the field of toxicology. However, there is little
   information available in the literature about quail cerebrum damage
   caused by DLM. Here, we investigated the effect of DLM on quail cerebrum
   neurons. Four groups of healthy quails were assigned (10 quails in each
   group), respectively given 0, 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg DLM by gavage for 12
   weeks. Through the measurements of quail cerebrum, it was found that DLM
   exposure induced obvious histological changes, oxidative stress, and
   neurons apoptosis. To further explore the possible molecular mechanisms,
   we performed real-time quantitative PCR to detect the expression of
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related mRNA such as glucose regulated
   protein 78 kD, activating transcription factor 6, inositol requiring
   enzyme, and protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase. In addition, we
   detected ATP content in quail cerebrum to evaluate the functional status
   of mitochondria. The study showed that DLM exposure significantly
   increased the expression of ER stress-related mRNA and decreased ATP
   content in quail cerebrum tissues. These results suggest that chronic
   exposure to DLM induces apoptosis of quail cerebrum neurons via
   promoting ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, our
   results provide a novel explanation for DLM-induced apoptosis of avian
   cerebrum neurons.},

Abstract = {Previously a standard toxicological test termed as DarT (Danio rerio
   Teratogenic assay) using wild type zebrafish embryos has been
   established and it is widely applied in toxicological and chemical
   screenings. As an increasing number of fluorescent transgenic zebrafish
   lines with specific fluorescent protein expression specifically
   expressed in different organs and tissues, we envision that the
   fluorescent markers may provide more sensitive endpoints for monitoring
   chemical induced phenotypical changes. Here we employed
   Tg(nkx2.2a:mEGFP) transgenic zebrafish which have GFP expression in the
   central nervous system to investigate its potential for screening
   neurotoxic chemicals. Five potential neurotoxins (acetaminophen,
   atenolol, atrazine, ethanol and lindane) and one neuroprotectant
   (mefenamic acid) were tested. We found that the GFP-labeled ventral
   axons from trunk motoneurons, which were easily observed in live fry and
   measured for quantification, were a highly sensitive to all of the five
   neurotoxins and the length of axons was significantly reduced in fry
   which looked normal based on DarT endpoints at low concentrations of
   neurotoxins. Compared to the most sensitive endpoints of DarT, ventral
   axon marker could improve the detection limit of these neurotoxins by
   about 10 fold. In contrast, there was no improvement for detection of
   the mefenamic acid compared to all DarT endpoints. Thus, ventral axon
   lengths provide a convenient and measureable marker specifically for
   neurotoxins. Our study may open a new avenue to use other fluorescent
   transgenic zebrafish embryos/fry to develop sensitive and specific
   toxicological tests for different categories of chemicals.},

   structure alterations were one of the most intuitive reflection to TAP
   exposure, which needs to analyze biochemical alterations for further
   study. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) showed a downward
   trend in the brain and liver of zebrafish. Simultaneously, the activity
   of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased after 96 h exposure with a
   concentration-dependent manner, which could be served as a suitable
   indicator of cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis-related genes
   (Apaf-1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9) transcription showed
   different alterations in response to the TAP treatment. These results
   indicated that TAP exposure led to apoptosis in zebrafish brain and
   liver and it was speculated that the apoptosis may occur through
   mitochondrial pathway. The present study demonstrated that the exposure
   of zebrafish to the insecticide TAP led to observe its effects at both
   histological structure and apoptosis level in liver and brain.},

Title = {Hypo- or hyperactivity of zebrafish embryos provoked by neuroactive
   substances: a review on how experimental parameters impact the
   predictability of behavior changes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Tests with zebrafish embryos have gained wide acceptance as an
   alternative test model for drug development and toxicity testing. In
   particular, the behavioral response of the zebrafish embryo is currently
   seen as a useful endpoint to diagnose neuroactive substances.
   Consequently, several behavioral test methods have been developed
   addressing various behavioral endpoints such as spontaneous tail coiling
   (STC), photomotor response (PMR), locomotor response (LMR) and
   alternating light/dark-induced locomotor response (LMR-L/D). Although
   these methods are distinct in their application, most of their protocols
   differ quite strongly in the use of experimental parameters and this is
   usually driven by different research questions. However, if a single
   mode of action is to be diagnosed, then varying experimental parameters
   may cause incoherent behavioral responses (hypo- or hyperactivity) of
   zebrafish during toxicity assessment. This could lead to
   inconclusiveness of behavioral test results for use within a prospective
   and diagnostic risk assessment framework. To investigate the influence
   of these parameters, we conducted a review of existing behavioral assays
   to address the following two questions: (1) To what extent do varying
   experimental parameters influence observed effects in published
   behavioral test methods? (2) Is the observed behavior change (hypo- or
   hyperactivity) of zebrafish embryos consistent with the expected mode of
   action of a chemical? We compiled a set of 18 substances which are
   anticipated to be neuroactive. We found that behavioral changes are not
   only affected by chemicals but also variation in the use of experimental
   parameters across studies seems to have a high impact on the outcome and
   thus comparability between studies. Four parameters, i.e., exposure
   concentration, exposure duration, endpoint parameter and developmental
   stage were the most influential parameters. Varying combinations of
   these parameters caused a non-reproducible outcome for the hyperactivity
   expected for the organophosphates; chlorpyrifos and diazinon. We
   highlighted that the STC test shows a higher capacity to predict the
   hyperactivity of organophosphates, while PMR and LMR-L/D were more
   suitable to predict the hypoactivity expected for anticonvulsants. We
   provide a list of recommendations which, when implemented, may help to
   exclude the risk of bias due to experimental parameters if similar goals
   are desired.},

Title = {Comprehensive fitness evaluation of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)
   after twelve weeks of atrazine exposure},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {718},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Atrazine is frequently detected in surface waters and negatively affect
   physiological function in aquatic organisms. Even though numerous
   authors have intensively studied its toxicity, only limited information
   concerning the long-term fish exposure is available. The aim of this
   study was evaluation of chronic exposure in common carp. Fish were
   exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations (0.3 - environmentally
   relevant concentration; 300; 1000; and 3000 mu g/l) for twelve weeks.
   The potential impact of atrazine exposure was studied using various
   markers (behaviour; biometrical characteristics; haematological,
   biochemical and oxidative stress indices and histopathological changes).
   Most alterations were recorded at the highest concentration (3000 mu
   g/l) which is probably due to a combined effect of both the herbicide
   exposure and intensive parasite infection development during second
   week. This group was cancelled after three weeks due to adverse health
   status, which partly confirmed atrazine immunotoxicity. Chronic exposure
   resulted in long-term reduction in feed intake followed by a significant
   decrease in body weight and morphological changes in gill at 1000 mu
   g/l. At the same concentration, significant alterations in
   haematological (e.g. increase in erythrocyte, leukocyte, lymphocytes and
   neutrophil counts as well as decrease in monocyte counts) and
   biochemical (e.g. changes in enzyme activities; increase in glucose;
   decrease in ammonia) indices were documented, especially during first
   three weeks. Similar trend, but not so intensive, was observed at 300 mu
   g/l. Moreover, significant changes were observed in various indicators
   of oxidative stress. These alterations were highly variable with both
   increasing and decreasing trends depending on dose and analysed tissue.
   Significant changes, especially in white blood profile, enzyme
   activities and oxidative stress indices, were proven even at 0.3 mu g/l.
   Obtained results indicate that chronic atrazine exposure of common carp
   can negatively influence many indicators of health status such as
   behaviour, immune response, haematological and biochemical profile,
   oxidative stress indices and organ histopathology. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {Abamectin induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity within early
   zebrafish embryos},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {10-18},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {During early zebrafish embryogenesis, spontaneous tail contractions
   represent the first sign of locomotion and result from innervation of
   primary motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on a
   high-content screen, we previously demonstrated that exposure of
   zebrafish embryos to abamectin - an avermectin insecticide - from 5-25
   hours post-fertilization (hpf) abolished spontaneous activity in the
   absence of effects on survival and gross morphology. Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to begin investigating the mechanism of
   abamectin-induced hypoactivity in zebrafish. Similar to 384-well plates,
   static exposure of embryos to abamectin from 5-25 hpf in glass beakers
   resulted in elimination of activity at low micromolar concentrations.
   However, abamectin did not affect neurite outgrowth from spinal
   motoneurons and, compared with exposure from 5-25 hpf, embryos were
   equally susceptible to abamectin-induced hypoactivity when exposures
   were initiated at 10 and 23 hpf. Moreover, immersion of
   abamectin-exposed embryos in clean water resulted in complete recovery
   of spontaneous activity relative to vehicle controls, suggesting that
   abamectin reversibly activated ligand-gated chloride channels and
   inhibited neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated
   embryos to vehicle or non-toxic concentrations of fipronil or endosulfan
   - two insecticides that antagonize the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   receptor - from 5-23 hpf, and then exposed embryos to vehicle or
   abamectin from 23-25 hpf. Interestingly, activity levels within
   abamectin-exposed embryos pretreated with either antagonist were similar
   to embryos exposed to vehicle alone. Using quantitative PCR and
   phylogenetic analyses, we then confirmed the presence of GABA receptor
   alpha 1 and beta 2 subunits at 5, 10, and 23 hpf, and demonstrated that
   zebrafish GABA receptor subunits are homologous to mammalian GABA
   receptor subunits. Overall, our data collectively suggest that abamectin
   induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity within early zebrafish
   embryos, an effect that may be mediated through the GABA receptor. (C)

Title = {Varying modalities of perinatal exposure to a pesticide cocktail elicit
   neurological adaptations in mice and zebrafish},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Epidemiological indications connect maternal and developmental presence
   or exposure to pesticides with an increased risk for a spectrum of
   neurological trajectories. To provide pre-clinical data in support of
   this hypothesis, we used two distinct experimental models. First, female
   and male mice were fed immediately prior to mating, and the resulting
   pregnant dams were continously fed during gestation and lactation
   periods using chow pellets containing a cocktail of six pesticides at
   tolerable daily intake levels. Male and female offspring were then
   tracked for behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological adaptations.
   Second, a zebrafish model allowed us to screen toxicity and
   motor-behavior outcomes specifically associated with the developmental
   exposure to a low-to-high concentration range of the cocktail and of
   each individual pesticide. Here, we report anxiety-like behavior in
   aging male mice maternally exposed to the cocktail, as compared to age
   and gender matched sham animals. In parallel, in vivo
   electrocorticography revealed a decrease in gamma (40-80 Hz) and an
   increase of theta (6-9 Hz) waves, delineating a long-term,
   age-dependent, neuronal slowing. Neurological changes were not
   accompanied by brain structural malformations. Next, by using zebrafish
   larvae, we showed an increase of all motor behavioral parameters
   resulting from the developmental exposure to 10 mg/L of pesticide
   cocktail, an outcome that was not associated with midbrain structural or
   neurovascular modifications as assessed by in vivo 2-photon microscopy.
   When screening each pesticide, chlorpyrifos elicited modifications of
   swimming parameters at 0.1 mg/L, while other components provoked changes
   from 0.5 mg/L. Ziram was the single most toxic component inducing
   developmental malformations and mortality at 10 mg/L. Although we have
   employed non-equivalent modalities and timing of exposure in two
   dissimilar experimental models, these outcomes indicate that presence of
   a pesticide cocktail during perinatal periods represents an element
   promoting behavioral and neurophysiological modifications. The study
   limitations and the possible pertinence of our findings to ecotoxicology
   and public health are critically discussed (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Analysis of tail coiling activity of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
   allows for the differentiation of neurotoxicants with different modes of
   action},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {186},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {In (eco)toxicology, there is a critical need for efficient methods to
   evaluate the neurotoxic potential of environmental chemicals. Recent
   studies proposed analysis of early coiling activity in zebrafish embryos
   as a powerful tool for the identification of neurotoxic compounds. In
   order to demonstrate that the analysis of early tail movements of
   zebrafish embryos allows for the discrimination of neurotoxicants acting
   via different mechanisms, the present study investigated the effects of
   four different neurotoxicants on the embryogenesis (fish embryo toxicity
   test) and early tail coiling movements of zebrafish embryos. Cadmium
   predominantly increased the frequency of tail coiling at the late
   pharyngula stage. Dichlorvos delayed embryonic development and caused
   convulsive tail movements resulting in prolonged duration of tail coils.
   Embryos exposed to teratogenic concentrations of fluoxetine and
   citalopram displayed absence of spontaneous tail movements at 24 h
   post-fertilization. In contrast, a non-teratogenic test concentration of
   citalopram decreased coiling frequency at multiple time points. Results
   demonstrated that the analysis of tail coiling movements of zebrafish
   embryos has the potential to discriminate neurotoxic compounds with
   different primary modes of action. In addition, chemical-induced effects
   on coiling activity were shown to potentially overlap with effects on
   embryogenesis. Further studies are needed to clarify the interplay of
   unspecific developmental toxicity of neurotoxic chemicals and effects
   resulting from specific neurotoxic mechanisms.},

Title = {Enantioselective bioaccumulation and toxicity of rac-sulfoxaflor in
   zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {817},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Sulfoxaflor isa fourth-generation neonicotinoid insecticide mainly used
   to control sap-feeding pests. In this study, four stereoisomers of
   sulfoxaflor were separated using HPLC, and the absolute configurations
   of three stereoisomers were identified via single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction. First, the stability and isomerization of the four
   enantiomers and rac- sulfoxaflor in water and seven organic solvents
   were investigated. All enantiomers were extremely unstable in water with
   isomerization rates above 20\%. The racemate did not isomerize in any of
   the solutions and was stable in water (degradation rate less than 7\%).
   Therefore, we studied the acute toxicity, enantioselective behavior, and
   enzymatic activities of rac-sulfoxaflor in zebrafish. The
   bioaccumulation experiment demonstrated that the bioconcentration of
   sulfoxaflor in zebrafish was enantioselective, and the four enantiomers
   accumulated in zebrafish in the order (+)-2S,3S-sulfoxaflor
   (-)-2R,3R-sulfoxaflor > (+)-2R,3S-sulfoxaflor > (-)-2S,3R-sulfoxaflor.
   The effect of rac- sulfoxaflor on the enzymatic activities of zebrafish
   showed that superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase
   activities and malondialdehyde content were significantly enhanced as
   compared to those in control, whereas acetylcholinesterase was
   significantly reduced in the sulfoxaflor exposure treatment (p < 0.05),
   indicating that sulfoxaflor caused oxidative lesions and induced
   enzymatic activity in zebrafish. This study provides important
   information on the enantioselective behavior and toxic effects of
   sulfoxaflor, which can help assess the potential ecological risk of
   chiral pesticides to aquatic organisms.},

Title = {Neurobehavioral impairments caused by developmental imidacloprid
   exposure in zebrafish},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {81-90},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides are becoming more widely applied
   as organophosphate (OP) insecticides are decreasing in use. Because of
   their relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are
   thought to have reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However,
   there is scant published literature concerning the neurobehavioral
   effects of developmental exposure of vertebrates to neonicotinoids.
   Methods: Using zebrafish, we investigated the neurobehavioral effects of
   developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic neonicotinoid
   pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish were
   exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 mu M or 60 mu M
   of imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4 h to 5 d post
   fertilization. The functional effects of developmental exposure to both
   imidadoprid and nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay
   and-during adolescence and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral
   assays, including assessment of sensorimotor response and habituation in
   a tactile startle test, novel tank swimming, and shoaling behavior.
   Results: In larvae, developmental imidadoprid exposure at both doses
   significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains of zebrafish
   were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidadoprid than the AB{*}
   strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to
   imidacloprid significantly decreased novel tank exploration and
   increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did
   not affect novel tank swimming, it increased sensorimotor response to
   startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects of either compound were
   found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling stimulus.
   Discussion: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both
   early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in
   zebrafish. Its developmental neurotoxicity should be further
   investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {246},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study evaluated the acute developmental toxicity of six priority
   phthalic acid esters (PAEs) including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl
   phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate
   (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) in
   zebrafish embryos. A novel alcian blue and alizarin red double staining
   was performed to detect skeletal development of zebrafish larvae.
   Results revealed that all six PAEs could induce different developmental
   abnormalities in zebrafish larvae, including abnormal movement,
   decreased heart rate, spinal curvature, and pericardial edema. The bone
   development of zebrafish larvae exposed to PAEs was also affected by
   PAEs acute exposure. Among PAEs, DBP, and BBP even at low doses can
   cause mortality in zebrafish, implying their higher toxicity.
   Contrarily, DEHP and DNOP showed minor effects on the developmental
   morphology of zebrafish larvae. However, the gene expression levels of
   skeleton-related genes showed the upregulation of the runx2b and shha
   genes after DEHP and DBP exposure. Taken together, the strict use and
   release of PAEs in the environment should be supervised by the

Abstract = {This study evaluated the toxic effects and recovery patterns in
   zebrafish (Danio redo) after exposure to phosalone-based (PBP) and
   cypermethrin-based (CBP) pesticides. Initially, the 96 h LC50 values of
   the pesticides were calculated as being 5.35 mu g of active ingredient
   (AI) L-1 for CBP and 217 mu g AI L-1 for PBP based on measured
   concentrations. Accordingly, experimental groups were exposed to three
   sublethal concentrations of pesticides for 96 h, separately, and then
   zebrafish were transferred to pesticide-free conditions for 10 and 20
   days recovery periods. Biochemical markers were assessed including
   carboxylesterase (CaE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione
   S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase,
   catalase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST) activities
   after the exposure and recovery periods. Also, the pesticide
   concentrations in test water were quantified by high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Our results showed that AChE and CaE
   activities were significantly inhibited and GST was induced by both
   pesticides after 96 h exposure. For PBP exposure, the decreases for GST
   induction and CaE inhibition showed a partial recovery in pesticide-free
   conditions. However, the decreases in AChE activity for CBP exposure and
   insufficient increases in same enzyme activity for PBP exposure after 20
   days in pesticide-free conditions indicated that the projected recovery
   period was not enough to the recovery of AChE activities and for the
   improvement of fish health.},

Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Developing zebrafish are increasingly being used for rapid assessments
   of chemical toxicity, and these assays are frequently conducted in
   multi-well plastic plates. This study investigated the sorptive behavior
   of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) to
   uncoated 96-well polystyrene plates typically used for zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) testing. We measured the percent sorption in the presence and
   absence of zebrafish embryos, at two exposure concentrations, as well as
   using two-different procedures (addition of embryos to polystyrene
   plates either before analyte addition, or allowing 24 h of equilibrium
   between analyte addition and embryo addition to the polystyrene plates).
   Following exposure, the plates were extracted with hexane and analyzed
   using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
   Allowing 24 h of pre-incubation between the addition of analytes and
   embryos did not significantly impact the percent sorption. The percent
   sorption was higher for both PAHs and NPAHs at the lower exposure
   concentration, and sorption was lower in the presence of zebrafish
   embryos. A mass balance model was developed to predict the sorption to
   polystyrene plates, based on the PAH and NPAH mass distribution ratios
   between polystyrene and water. While PAH sorption was significantly
   correlated with subcooled liquid solubility, NPAH sorption did not
   correlate with any of the physical-chemical properties investigated.
   This indicates the need to better understand the sorptive behavior of
   hydrophobic analytes to plastics, and to better account for sorptive
   losses during toxicity testing in polystyrene plates. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used insecticide, which has been shown to
   interfere with neurobehavioral development. Rat models have been key in
   demonstrating that prenatal CPF exposure causes choice accuracy deficits
   and motor alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary
   nonmammalian models can be useful in determining the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the persisting behavioral effects of developmental
   CPF exposure. Zebrafish with their clear chorion and extensive
   developmental information base provide an excellent model for assessment
   of molecular processes of toxicant impacted neurodevelopment. To
   facilitate the use of the zebrafish model and to compare it to the more
   typical rodent models, the behavioral phenotype of CPF toxicity in
   zebrafish must be well characterized. Our laboratory has developed
   methods for assessing spatial discrimination learning in zebrafish,
   which can differentiate response latency from choice accuracy in a three
   chambered fish tank. Low and high doses of CPF (10 and 100 ng/ml on days
   1-5 postfertilization) both had significant persisting effects on both
   spatial discrimination and response latency over 18 weeks of testing.
   The high, but not the low dose, significantly accelerated mortality
   rates of the fish during the study from 20-38 weeks of age.
   Developmental exposure to either 10 or 100 ng/ml of CPF caused
   significant spatial discrimination impairments in zebrafish when they
   were adults. The impairment caused by 10 ng/ml was seen during early but
   not later testing, while the impairment caused by 100 ng/ml became more
   pronounced with continued testing. The higher dose caused a more
   pervasive impairment. The 10 and 100 ng/ml doses had opposite effects on
   response latency. The low 10 ng/ml dose significantly slowed response
   latency, while the high 100 ng/ml dose significant increased response
   latency. Both of these effects diminished with continued testing. CPF
   exposure during early development caused clear behavioral impairments,
   which lasted throughout adulthood in zebrafish. The molecular mechanisms
   by which early developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral
   impairments expressed in adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish
   model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin are insecticides commonly used in
   agriculture. The mixed residues of chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin in the
   aquatic environment may have combined effects on nontarget species.
   Therefore, studying the combined toxic effects and mechanisms of
   pesticide mixtures is of great significance to environmental risk
   assessment. To evaluate the risk of combined exposure, we examined the
   effects of both compounds, separately and together, on motor activity,
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and neurotransmitter levels in
   larval zebrafish. Chlorpyrifos exposure significantly reduced functional
   motor capacity (swim distance and velocity) and enhanced meandering,
   while cyfluthrin exposure alone had no significant effects on swim
   parameters. However, combined exposure significantly reduced total
   swimming distance and mean velocity and increased meandering. Both
   compounds alone and the combination significantly reduced AChE activity,
   and the combined effect was antagonistic. Combined exposure also
   significantly altered the concentrations of serotonin, serotonin
   precursors, and dopamine precursors, as well as concentrations of the
   amino acid neurotransmitters glycine, alanine, and aspartic acid.
   Combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin exhibited distinct
   joint action modes in terms of neurobehavior, AChE activity, and
   neurotransmitter levels, thereby providing an experimental basis for
   assessing the combined exposure to chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin's
   environmental risk.},

Journal = {TOXICOLOGY REPORTS},

Abstract = {Exposure to environmental risk factors such as herbicides in early life
   has been proposed to play important roles in the development of
   neurodegenerative disorders in adult life. To test this hypothesis, we
   used a zebrafish model to link the herbicide paraquat (PQ) to disease
   etiology. Strikingly, treatment of 18 hpf embryonic zebrafish with
   low-dose PQ treatment (0.04 ppm, lower than the accepted human daily
   exposure) resulted in 50\% display of neurodegenerative phenotypes and
   motor deficits at various developmental stages (segmentation to larval
   stage). Wide arrays of biomarkers have been employed to delineate the
   toxic responses which include lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) and
   apoptosis studies. A decrease in the GSH levels, increase in lipid
   peroxidation and apoptosis, respectively, were observed at various
   developmental stages. Unexpectedly, we show that the exposure to
   paraquat during the window of dopamine neurogenesis causes Parkinsonian
   like motor defects in later life by perturbing cholinergic system due to

Title = {Pyridaben induced cardiotoxicity during the looping stages of zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) embryos},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pyridaben is a widely used acaricide in agriculture and reaches a high
   concentration (97 mu g/L) in paddy water for a short time when pyridaben
   was applied to rice. However, its toxicity to aquatic organisms is still
   poorly understood. Therefore, we assessed the pyridaben cardiotoxicity
   to aquatic organisms using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. We found
   that pyridaben is highly toxic to aquatic organisms, and LC50 of
   pyridaben for zebrafish at 72 hpf was 100.6 mu g/L. Pyridaben caused
   severe cardiac malformations and functional abnormalities. Morphologic
   abnormity included severe pericardial edema, cardiomegaly, decreased
   cardiomyocytes, thinning of the myocardial layer, linear heart, and
   increased the distance between sinus venous and bulbus arteriosus
   (SVBA). Functional failure included arrhythmia, heart failure, and
   reduced pumping efficiency. The genes involved in heart development, WNT
   signaling, BMP signaling, ATPase, and cardiac troponin C were abnormally
   expressed in the pyridaben treatment group. Exposure to pyridaben
   increased oxidative stress and induced cell apoptosis. The above causes
   may lead to cardiac toxicity. The results suggest that pyridaben
   exposure induced elevated oxidative stress through the WNT signaling
   pathway, which in turn led to apoptosis in the heart and cardiotoxicity.
   Besides, pyridaben exposure at the critical stage of cardiac looping
   (24-36 hpf) resulted in the greatest cardiotoxicity. The chorion reduced
   the entry of pyridaben and protected zebrafish embryos, resulting in
   cardiotoxicity second only to the stage of cardiac looping. The study
   should provide valuable information that pyridaben exposure causes
   cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and have potential health risks for
   other aquatic organisms and humans.},

Abstract = {Fish behaviors have great potential as models for the study of
   pharmacology, genetics, and neuroscience. Zebrafish (Danio rerio),
   Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris
   rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral
   use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by
   oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not
   well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented
   a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like
   behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to
   light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and
   memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no
   response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In
   addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three
   species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01\% v/v
   carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to
   zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes
   in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5
   mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open
   field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid,
   respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are
   negligible when using <0.01\% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral
   assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral
   responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be
   insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other
   environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have
   major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality
   monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Assessing the toxicity of three ``inert{''} herbicide safeners toward
   Danio rerio: Effects on embryos development},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Recent studies indicated that `inert ingredients' exert negative effects
   on the environment. Herbicide safeners are classed as `inert
   ingredients', which increase the selectivity and detoxification of
   herbicides. However, little attention has been focused on the
   environmental behavior of herbicide safeners. AD-67 (AD), fenclorim
   (FM), and flurazole (FZ) are three commercially available herbicide
   safeners. In this study, zebrafish embryos were used as a model to
   investigate the potential developmental toxicity of these three
   safeners. The results showed that AD, FM, and FZ 96 h-LC50 values were
   2.52, 1.26, and 2.01 mg/L, respectively. Significant decreased body
   lengths were observed in embryos after 96 h of exposure to 0.2 mg/L FM
   and FZ. Hatching rates significantly increased at 24 h and decreased at
   96 h in all treatment groups (0.02 mg/L AD, 0.2 mg/L AD, 0.02 mg/L AD,
   0.2 mg/L FZ, as well as 0.01 and 0.1 mg/L FM). No significant (p > 0.05)
   changes in heartbeat numbers (60 s), but clearly increased malformation
   rates were observed in response to safeners exposure. Furthermore,
   embryos showed signs of oxidative stress, such as decreased activities
   of superoxide dismutase, altered activities of glutathione reductase and
   catalase and cell apoptosis. The gene transcription related to body
   malformation (egf, krt 17, and tbx 16) and cell apoptosis (bcl 2 and
   bax) changed in treated groups. These genes have been connected to
   potential toxicological mechanisms. These results indicate that the
   herbicide safeners AD, FM, and FZ induced developmental toxicities in
   zebrafish embryos. This study is the first report of the toxicity of
   safeners in the development of zebrafish embryos. The results may be
   useful for assessing the risk of herbicides safeners in the aquatic
   ecosystem.},

Abstract = {The fish embryo toxicity test has been proposed as an alternative for
   the acute fish toxicity test, but concerns have been raised for its
   predictivity given that a few compounds have been shown to exhibit a
   weak acute toxicity in the fish embryo. In order to better define the
   applicability domain and improve the predictive capacity of the fish
   embryo test, we performed a systematic analysis of existing fish embryo
   and acute fish toxicity data. A correlation analysis of a total of 153
   compounds identified 28 compounds with a weaker or no toxicity in the
   fish embryo test. Eleven of these compounds exhibited a neurotoxic mode
   of action. We selected a subset of eight compounds with weaker or no
   embryo toxicity (cyanazine, picloram, aldicarb, azinphos-methyl,
   dieldrin, diquat dibromide, endosulfan, and esfenvalerate) to study
   toxicokinetics and a neurotoxic mode of action as potential reasons for
   the deviating fish embryo toxicity. Published fish embryo LC50 values
   were confirmed by experimental analysis of zebrafish embryo LC50
   according to OECD guideline 236. Except for diquat dibromide, internal
   concentration analysis did not indicate a potential relation of the low
   sensitivity of fish embryos to a limited uptake of the compounds.
   Analysis of locomotor activity of diquat dibromide and the neurotoxic
   compounds in 98 hpf embryos (exposed for 96 h) indicated a specific
   effect on behavior (embryonic movement) for the neurotoxic compounds.
   The EC(50)s of behavior for neurotoxic compounds were close to the acute
   fish toxicity LC50. Our data provided the first evidence that the
   applicability domain of the fish embryo test (LC(50)s determination) may
   exclude neurotoxic compounds. However, neurotoxic compounds could be
   identified by changes in embryonic locomotion. Although a quantitative
   prediction of acute fish toxicity LC50 using behavioral assays in fish
   embryos may not yet be possible, the identification of neurotoxicity
   could trigger the conduction of a conventional fish acute toxicity test
   or application of assessment factors while considering the very good
   fish embryo-acute fish toxicity correlation for other compounds.},

Abstract = {Imidacloprid (IMI) and thiamethoxam (THM) are two commonly applied
   neonicotinoid insecticides. IMI and THM could cause negative impacts on
   non-target organisms like bees. However, the information about

   activity at 28 dpf. The qPCR data revealed that IMI and THM affected the
   transcription of marker genes belonging to the synapse from 14 dpf to 35
   dpf. Furthermore, IMI and THM mainly affected transcription of key genes
   in gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine and serotonin pathways in larvae at

Abstract = {Thifluzamide is a fungicide widely used to control crop diseases, and it

   zebrafish were selected to assess the aquatic toxicity of thifluzamide.
   The acute and development toxicity of thifluzamide to embryos, larvae,

   were as follows: adult fish (4.19 mg/L) <larvae (3.52 mg/L) <embryos
   (3.08 mg/L). A large suite of symptoms was found in these three stages
   of zebrafish, including abnormal spontaneous movement, slow heartbeat,

Abstract = {Previous studies reported that exposure to environmentally relevant
   concentrations of TDCIPP significantly decreased the number of
   cumulative eggs in zebrafish, but effects on the quantity of eggs and
   sperms remained unknown. Therefore, in this study, effects of TDCIPP on
   yolk diameter, surface morphology of eggs, sperm density and total
   motility were evaluated. First generation (FO) zebrafish larvae (Danio
   rerio) were exposed to 0, 50, 500 or 5000 ng/L
   tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) from 14 days post
   fertilization (dpf) to 120 dpf. The FO generation of zebrafish were
   paired and Fl generation of embryos were collected and continuously
   exposed to the same concentrations of TDCIPP until 150 dpf. TDCIPP
   bioconcentration in the whole body as well as effects on survival and
   fecundity were evaluated in Fl generation. Exposure to TDCIPP resulted
   in an accumulation of the chemical and decreased survival of Fl
   generation of zebrafish. TDCIPP decreased cumulative production and
   changed surface morphology of eggs in females. In males, TDCIPP
   decreased total motility of sperm but did not affect sperm density.
   These effects on quality of egg and sperm might be responsible for the
   decreased hatching rates observed in cross mating experiments.
   Furthermore, TDCIPP exposure resulted in down-regulated gene expression
   related to gonadal development and maturation of germ cells in females
   or/and males, and the down-regulation was correlated to decreased
   fecundity. Taken together, the results suggested that exposure to TDCIPP
   could decrease the quantity of eggs and sperms by down-regulating the
   expression of genes related to gonadal development and maturation of
   germ cells in zebrafish.},

Title = {Transcriptional impact of organophosphate and metal mixtures on
   olfaction: Copper dominates the chlorpyrifos-induced response in adult
   zebrafish},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {205-215},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Chemical exposures in fish have been linked to loss of olfaction leading
   to an inability to detect predators and prey and decreased survival.
   However, the mechanisms underlying olfactory neurotoxicity are not well
   characterized, especially in environmental exposures which involve
   chemical mixtures. We used zebrafish to characterize olfactory
   transcriptional responses by two model olfactory inhibitors, the
   pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mixtures of CPF with the neurotoxic
   metal copper (Cu). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from
   olfactory tissues of zebrafish exposed to CPF alone or to a mixture of
   CPF and Cu. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using principal
   component analysis and hierarchical clustering, whereas gene set
   analysis was used to identify biological themes in the microarray data.
   Microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR on genes serving as
   potential biomarkers of olfactory injury. In addition, we mined our
   previously published Cu-induced zebrafish olfactory transcriptional
   response database (Tilton et al., 2008) for the purposes of
   discriminating pathways of olfaction impacted by either the individual
   agents or the CPF-Cu mixture transcriptional signatures. CPF exposure
   altered the expression of gene pathways associated with cellular
   morphogenesis and odorant binding, but not olfactory signal
   transduction, a known olfactory pathway for Cu. The mixture profiles
   shared genes from the Cu and CPF datasets, whereas some genes were
   altered only by the mixtures. The transcriptional signature of the
   mixtures was more similar to that in zebrafish exposed to Cu alone than
   for CPF. In conclusion, exposure to a mixture containing a common
   environmental metal and pesticide causes a unique transcriptional
   signature that is heavily influenced by the metal, even when
   organophosphate predominates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Characterization of Developmental Neurobehavioral Toxicity in a
   Zebrafish MPTP-Induced Model: A Novel Mechanism Involving Anemia},
Journal = {ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Abstract = {Zebrafish represent an economical alternative to rodents for
   developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing. Mechanistic understanding is
   the key to successfully translating zebrafish findings to humans. In the
   present study, we used a well-known dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy-dropyridine (MPTP) as a model chemical
   to uncover the molecular pathways for observed DNT effects. To enhance
   the specificity of potential molecular targets, we restricted our
   exposure to a concentration that is nonteratogenic yet exhibits high DNT
   effects and an exposure window sensitive to MPTP. Our DNT assessment
   based on a battery of motor and social behavioral tests revealed an
   effective concentration of 1 mu M and a sensitive window of 48-96 h
   postfertilization (hpf) for MPTP-induced hypoactivity. It is worth
   noting that this hypoactivity persisted into later larval development
   until 28 dpf. We observed increased cell apoptosis, oxidative stress,
   and decreased ATP levels in larvae immediately after exposure at 96 hpf.
   Significant reductions of DA neurons were found in the retina at 72, 96,
   and 120 hpf. No visible deformity was found in motoneurons at 72, 96,
   and 120 hpf. Transcriptome analysis uncovered a novel pathway manifested
   by significant upregulation of genes enriched with erythropoiesis.
   Sensitive window exposure of MPTP and other DA neurotoxins rotenone and
   paraquat exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on transcriptional
   changes of embryonic hemoglobins and anemia. Given that anemia is a
   significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease and MPTP is known to
   cause parkinsonism in humans, we concluded that anemia resulting from
   dysregulation of primitive erythropoiesis during embryonic development
   might serve as a common mechanism underlying DA neurotoxin-induced DNT
   effects between zebrafish and humans.},

Title = {Comparative behavioral toxicology with two common larval fish models:
   Exploring relationships among modes of action and locomotor responses},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {640},
Pages = {1587-1600},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Behavioral responses inform toxicology studies by rapidly and
   sensitively detecting molecular initiation events that propagate to
   physiological changes in individuals. These behavioral responses can be
   unique to chemical specific mechanisms and modes of action (MOA) and
   thus present diagnostic utility. In an initial effort to explore the use
   of larval fish behavioral response patterns in screening environmental
   contaminants for toxicity and to identify behavioral responses
   associated with common chemical specific MOAs, we employed the two most
   common fish models, the zebrafish and the fathead minnow, to define
   toxicant induced swimming activity alterations during interchanging
   photoperiods. Though the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is a
   common model for aquatic toxicology research and regulatory toxicology
   practice, this model has received little attention in behavioral studies
   compared to the zebrafish, a common biomedical model. We specifically
   compared behavioral responses among 7 different chemicals (1-heptanol,
   phenol, R-(-)-carvone, citalopram, diazinon, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ),
   and xylazine) that were selected and classified based on anticipated MOA
   (nonpolar narcosis, polar narcosis, electrophile, specific mechanism)
   according to traditional approaches to examine whether these comparative
   responses differ among chemicals with various structure-based predicted
   toxicity. Following standardized experimental guidelines, zebrafish
   embryos and fathead minnow larvae were exposed for 96 h to each compound
   then were observed using digital behavioral analysis. Behavioral
   observations included photomotor responses, distance traveled, and
   stimulatory, refractory and cruising locomotor activity. Though fathead
   minnow larvae displayed greater behavioral sensitivity to 1-heptanol,
   phenol and citalopram, zebrafish were more sensitive to diazinon and
   R-(-)-carvone. Both fish models were equally sensitive to xylazine and
   PTZ. Further, the pharmaceuticals citalopram and xylazine significantly
   affected behavior at therapeutic hazard values, and each of the seven
   chemicals elicited unique behavioral response profiles. Larval fish
   behaviors appear useful as early tier diagnostics to identify mechanisms
   and pathways associated with diverse biological activities for chemicals
   lacking mechanistic data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A new selective molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) for solid phase
   extraction of profenofos (PFF) from aqueous solutions was synthesized by
   acrylonitrile grafted cotton fibers with hydrazine hydrate in presence
   of PFF as a template and glutraldhyde as a cross linker. The properties
   and structure of MIP was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental
   analysis (EA). Furthermore, the extracted PFF was detected by gas
   chromatography (GC). Various parameters such as (pH, contact time,
   temperature, initial concentration of PFF and also washing eluent
   composition) affecting the extraction efficiency was evaluated to
   investigate the selectivity and preconcentration from different
   matrices. Kinetic studies revealed that pseudo second order kinetic
   equation is the best model describes the adsorption behavior of PFF on
   MIP. Moreover, the obtained thermodynamic parameters (Delta G(0) < 0,
   Delta H-0 > 0, Delta S-0 > 0) indicated a spontaneous and endothermic
   reaction. Furthermore, the maximum sorption capacity was 17.24 mg g(-1).
   Under the experimental work conditions, limit of detection and limit of
   quantification were found to be 0.294 mg L-1 and 0.98 mg L-1,
   respectively. Finally, the proposed imprinted polymer was successfully
   applied for the extraction of PFF from wastewater and commercial plant

Title = {Evaluation and comparison of the mitochondrial and developmental
   toxicity of three strobilurins in zebrafish embryo/larvae},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {270},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Strobilurin fungicides have been frequently detected in aquatic
   environments and can induce mitochondrial toxicity to non-target aquatic
   organisms. However, the derived toxicity and subsequent mechanisms
   related to their adverse effects are not fully elucidated. In the
   present study, we compared the mitochondrial and developmental toxicity
   of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin using zebrafish
   embryo/larvae. The results showed that all three strobilurins inhibited
   mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration (the potency is
   pyraclostrobin approximate to trifloxystrobin > azoxystrobin).
   Behavioral changes indicated that sublethal doses of pyraclostrobin and
   azoxystrobin caused hyperactivity of zebrafish larvae in dark cycles,
   whereas trifloxystrobin resulted in hypoactivity of zebrafish larvae. In
   addition, pyraclostrobin exposure impaired the inflation of swim
   bladder, and caused down-regulation of annexin A5 (anxa5) mRNA levels,
   and up-regulated transcript levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a
   (pbx1a); conversely, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin did not cause
   detectable effects with swim bladder inflation. Molecular docking
   results indicated that azoxystrobin had higher interacting potency with
   iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD), prolactin receptor (PRLR), antagonistic
   conformation of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) and
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) compared to pyraclostrobin and
   trifloxystrobin; pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin were more likely to
   interact with the antagonistic conformation of TR beta and GR,
   respectively. These results may partially explain the different effects
   observed in behavior and swim bladder inflation, and also point to
   potential endocrine disruption induced by these strobilurins. Taken
   together, our study revealed that all three strobilurins alter
   mitochondrial bioenergetics and cause developmental toxicity. However,
   the toxic phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of each chemical may
   differ, and this requires further investigation. Pyraclostrobin showed
   higher mitochondrial toxicity at lethal doses and higher developmental
   toxicity at sublethal doses compared to the two other strobilurins
   tested. These results provide novel information for toxicological study
   as well as risk assessment of strobilurin fungicides. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {Objectives Exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a neurotoxic insecticide, is
   implicated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children through
   noncholinergic mechanisms.
   Methods This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in
   three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for
   neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower
   than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
   Results CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during
   neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor
   activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social
   behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are
   transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific
   systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating
   those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed
   concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects
   on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had
   greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and
   exposure during the gestation day 10-14 window showed consistent
   increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (<= 1.0 mg kg(-1)
   day(-1)). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF
   treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive
   dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway.
   Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects
   after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold
   for AChE inhibition.
   Conclusions Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence
   for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms.
   Variability in laboratories, exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal
   species/strain might have contributed to the inconsistent results. The
   detrimental CPF effects during early development are relevant to human
   populations.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth in the global production of organophosphate esters
   (OPEs) has resulted in their high environmental concentrations. The low
   removal rate of OPEs makes the effluents of wastewater treatment plants
   be one of the major sources of OPEs. Due to relatively high solubility
   and mobility, OPEs can be carried to the coastal environment through
   river discharge and atmospheric deposition. Therefore, the coastal
   environment can be an important OPE sink. Previous studies have shown
   that OPEs were widely detected in coastal atmospheres, water, sediments,
   and even aquatic organisms. OPEs can undergo various environmental
   processes in the coastal environment, including adsorption/desorption,
   air-water exchange, and degradation. In addition, bioaccumulation of
   OPEs was observed in coastal biota but current concentrations would not
   cause significant ecological risks. More efforts are required to
   understand the environmental behaviors of OPEs and address resultant
   environmental and health risks, especially in the complicated

Title = {The agrochemical S-metolachlor disrupts molecular mediators and

   zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Metolachlor herbicides are derived from the chloroacetamide chemical
   family of which there are the Sand Rmetolachlor isomers. S-metolachlor
   is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via
   enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and
   studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are
   no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim
   bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark
   preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval
   locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we
   exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of
   S-metolachlor (0.5-50 mu M) over early development. S-metolachlor
   affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental
   deformities at concentrations of 50 mu M and above. Exposure levels as
   high as 200 mu M for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates
   in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to
   mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim
   bladder inflation at 50 mu M in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms
   related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes
   associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin,
   annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha
   (alpha)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish exposed to 50 mu M
   while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance, corresponding
   to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response test
   revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light
   with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 mu
   M) resulted in hypo activity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis
   indicated that there was a positive relationship between surface area of
   the swim bladder and distance traveled, and the size of the swim bladder
   explained similar to 10-14\% in the variation for total distance moved.
   Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test, and we did not
   detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration tested. Here
   we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure to
   the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may
   disrupt transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and
   morphology, which could ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity.
   These data are expected to contribute to further risk assessment
   guidelines for S-metolachlor in aquatic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Understanding the metabolism of chemicals as well as the distribution
   and depuration of their main metabolites in tissues are essential for
   evaluating their fate and potential toxicity in vivo. Herein, we
   investigated the metabolism of six typical organophosphate (OP) flame
   retardants (tripropyl phosphate (TPRP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP),
   tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate
   (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tri-p-cresyl
   phosphate (p-TCP)) in adult zebrafish in laboratory at three levels (0,
   1/150 LC50 (environmentally relevant level), and 1/30 LC50 per OP
   analog). Twenty main metabolites were detected in the liver of
   OPs-exposed zebrafish using high resolution mass spectrometry (Q-TOF).
   The reaction pathways involving scission of the ester bond (hydrolysis),
   cleavage of the ether bond, oxidative hydroxylation, dechlorination, and
   coupling with glucuronic acid were proposed, and were further confirmed
   by the frontier electron density and point charge calculations. Tissue
   distribution of the twenty metabolites revealed that liver and intestine
   with the highest levels of metabolites were the most active organs for
   OPs biotransformation among the studied tissues of intestine, liver,
   roe, brain, muscle, and gill, which showed the importance of
   hepatobiliary system (liver-bile-intestine) in the metabolism and
   excretion of OPs in zebrafish. Fast depuration of metabolites from
   tissues indicated that the formed metabolites might be not persistent in
   fish, and easily released into water. This study provides comprehensive
   information on the metabolism of OPs in the tissue of zebrafish, which
   might give some hints for the exploration of their toxic mechanism in
   aquatic life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most commonly applied agricultural
   herbicide in the United States. Due to contamination concerns, the U.S.
   EPA has set the maximum contaminant level in potable water sources at 3
   parts per billion (ppb; mu g/l). Depending on the time of year and
   sampling location, water sources often exceed this limit. ATZ is an
   endocrine disrupting chemical in multiple species observed to target the
   neuroendocrine system. In this study the zebrafish vertebrate model was
   used to test the hypothesis that a developmental ATZ exposure generates
   metabolites similar to those found in mammals and alters morphology and
   behavior in developing larvae. Adult AB zebrafish were bred, embryos
   were collected, and exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb ATZ from 1 to 120 h
   post fertilization (hpf). Targeted metabolomic analysis found that
   zebrafish produce the same major ATZ metabolites as mammals: desethyl
   atrazine (DEA), deisopropyl atrazine (DIA), and diaminochloroatrazine
   (DACT). The visual motor response test at 120 hpf detected hyperactivity
   in larvae in the 0.3 ppb treatment group and hypoactivity in the 30 ppb
   treatment group (p < 0.05). Further analysis into behavior during the
   dark and light phases showed zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had
   an increase in total distance moved in the first light phase and time
   spent moving in the first dark and light phases (p < 0.05).
   Alternatively, a decrease in total distance moved was observed in the
   second and third dark phases in zebrafish exposed to 30 ppb ATZ (p
   0.05). No significant differences were observed for any of the
   morphological measurements following ATZ exposure from 1 to 120 hpf (p
   0.05). These findings suggest that a ATZ exposure during early
   development generates metabolite profiles similar to mammals and leads
   to behavioral alterations supporting ATZ as a neurodevelopmental
   toxicant.},

Abstract = {Agrochemicals are a major cause of concern for the aquatic environment
   because of their toxicity, persistence, and tendency to accumulate in
   the organisms. The impact of these chemicals on aquatic organisms is due
   to their movement from various diffuse or point sources, which poses a
   great threat to aquatic fauna especially fishes, which constitute one of
   the major sources of protein-rich food for mankind. The present study is
   a first of its kind, where the toxic potential of two sublethal
   concentration (LC1/10th and LC1/25th) of four different classes of
   agrochemicals have been tested (Insecticide- Imidacloprid-0.074 ppm,
   0.02 ppm, Fungicide-Curzate- 4.9 ppm, 1.96 ppm, Herbicide-
   Pyrazosulphuron ethyl-50 ppm, 20 ppm and Fertilizer-Micronutrient
   mixture 500 ppm, 200 ppm) on candidate markers of hypothalamus
   pituitary-thyroid axis (TSH, T-3, T-4, TSH beta r) in Oreochromis
   mossambicus (tilapia) by validating hormonal level and mRNA expression.
   The results reveal that exposure to agrochemicals resulted in a broad
   range of alterations with maximum damage being caused by insecticide
   followed by herbicide and fungicide in that order on the thyroid axis.
   The results of the present study highlight the need for more detailed
   studies on the effects of agrochemicals that accumulate in organisms and
   propose that there should be a check on the rampant use of
   agrochemicals.},

Abstract = {Climbazole is an antifungal active ingredient used in personal care
   products. After application this chemical reaches the aquatic
   environment and may pose a risk to fish. In the present study, we
   measured the transcriptional effects of essential genes related to a
   wide range of signaling pathways on zebrafish eleutheroembryos exposed
   to climbazole at environmentally relevant and predicted worst-case
   environmental concentrations, and explored the potential biomarkers via
   partial least squares discriminant analysis. Transcription analysis
   covering up to 73 genes revealed significant down-regulation of
   circadian rhythm- and steroidogenesis-related genes in zebrafish embryos
   and larvae after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of
   climbazole. This topical antifungal agent also modulated the transcripts
   of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, oocyte maturation,
   and sexual differentiation at predicted worst-case environmental
   concentrations. In addition, mpr alpha, igf3, nr1d1, nr1d2b, cyp19a1a,
   vtg1, il-1 beta, and il-8 were chosen as potential biomarkers in
   embryonic zebrafish following exposure to climbazole. These findings can
   help us understand the remarkable transcriptional response to climbazole
   in the early life stage of zebrafish. Future research should elucidate
   whether the transcriptional modulation translates into metabolic
   phenotypes associated with the corresponding signaling pathways. Environ

Title = {Getting more out of the zebrafish light dark transition test},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In (eco-)toxicological studies the light/dark transition (LDT) test is
   one of the most frequently used behaviour assays with zebrafish
   eleutheroembryos. However, study results vary regarding data
   presentation and analysis and mostly focus on a limited amount of the
   recorded data. In this study, we investigated whether monitoring two
   behavioural outcomes (time and distance moved) together with analysing
   multiple parameters can improve test sensitivity and data
   interpretation. As a proof of principle 5-day old zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) eleutheroembryos exposed to either endocrine disruptors (EDs) or
   acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors were investigated. We analysed
   conventional parameters such as mean and sum and implemented additional
   endpoints such as minimum or maximum distance moved and new parameters
   assessing the bursting response of eleutheroembryos. Furthermore,
   changes in eleutheroembryonic behaviour during the moment of the light
   to dark transition were added. To improve data presentation
   control-normalised results were displayed in radar charts, enabling the
   simultaneous presentation of different parameters in relation to each
   other. This enabled us to identify parameters most relevant to a certain
   behavioural response. A cut off threshold using control data was applied
   to identify parameters that were altered in a biological relevant
   manner. Our approach was able to detect effects on different parameters
   that remained undetected when analysis was done using conventional bar
   graphs on - in most cases analysed - averaged, mean distance moved
   values. By combining the radar charts with additional parameters and by
   using control-based thresholds, we were able to increase the test
   sensitivity and promote a deeper understanding of the behaviour response
   of zebrafish eleutheroembryos in the LDT test and thereby increased its
   usability for behavioural toxicity studies.},

Title = {Transgenerational effects of developmental exposure to chlorpyrifos-oxon
   in zebrafish (DANIO RERIO)},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {408},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The organophosphate chlorpyrifos, and its active metabolite
   chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), have been attributed to a number of
   neurodevelopmental disorders. It is unclear if the adverse effects
   associated with developmental exposure to the active CPO persist into
   adulthood and future generations. The goal of this study was to
   investigate whether CPO-associated changes in embryo-larval zebrafish
   (ZF) behavior at the F0 5 dpf were manifest throughout the life of the
   exposed F0, and are inherited by subsequent generations. For this study,
   embryos were exposed to chlorpyrifos-oxon at the environmentally
   relevant concentration of 0.01 mu g/L and a high concentration of 50 mu
   g/L starting at 4 hpf to 5 dpf, and then raised to F2. There was a
   significant decrease in distance traveled with 5 dpf F0 ZF exposed to
   the 50 mu g/L CPO, with alterations in noncholinergic genes CFOS and
   LINGO, and alterations in global DNA methylation. CPO-related behavioral
   effects were ameliorated by day 21 through the F1 generation. This trend
   changed with hyperactive behavior, increase acetylcholine concentration
   in F2 zebrafish that were exposed to 50 mu g/L CPO during the F0
   development. There was also an increase in AChE activity and
   hypermethylation in F2 0.01 mu g/L exposure larvae, indicating that even
   low dose exposures can have transgenerational effects. Results from this
   study demonstrate that early life stage exposures to CPO can lead to
   epigenetic changes in neurological activity, which may lead to
   alterations in response to CPO in future generations.
   Abstract summary: This study identified a correlation between CPO
   exposure during F0 development and significant differences in F2
   behavioral, AChE activity and neurotransmitter concentration.},

Abstract = {As the older class of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are phased out
   of commercial use because of findings of neurotoxicity with
   developmental exposure, a newer class of flame retardants have been
   introduced, the organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Presently,
   little is known about the potential for developmental neurotoxicity or
   the behavioral consequences of OPFR exposure. Our aim was to
   characterize the life-long neurobehavioral effects of 4 widely used
   OPFRs using the zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1\%
   DMSO (vehicle control); or one of the following treatments;
   isopropylated phenyl phosphate (IPP) (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mu M);
   butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP) (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 mu M);
   2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) (0.03, 0.3, 1 mu M); isodecyl
   diphenyl phosphate (IDDP) (0.1, 0.3,1, 10 mu M) from 0- to 5-days
   postfertilization. On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under
   alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the
   exposed fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests
   to assess emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction
   and predator evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term
   effects of altered motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds,
   and long-term impairment of anxiety-related behavior in adults following
   IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures. Our results show that OPFRs may not be a
   safe alternative to the phased-out BFRs and may cause behavioral impacts
   throughout the lifespan. Further research should evaluate the risk to
   mammalian experimental models and humans.},

Abstract = {Prothioconazole (PTA) is a novel, broad-spectrum, chiral triazole
   fungicide that is mainly used to prevent and control the disease of
   cereal crops. However, the adverse effects of PTA and its major
   metabolite on nontarget organisms have aroused wide concern. In the
   present work, the acute toxic of the metabolite prothioconazole-desthio
   (PTA-desthio), with an LC50 of 1.31 mg L-1, was 3.5-fold more toxic than
   the parent compound, indicating that the metabolism of PTA in zebrafish
   was toxic. The stereoselective uptake and metabolism of PTA and
   PTA-desthio in zebrafish was firstly investigated using LC-MS/MS.
   Remarkable enantioselectivity was observed: S-PTA and S-PTA-desthio were
   preferentially uptake with the uptake rate constants of 8.22 and 8.15
   d(-1) at exposure concentration of 0.5 mg L-1, respectively, and the
   R-PTA-desthio were preferentially metabolized. PTA-desthio was rapidly
   formed during the uptake processes. The antioxidant enzyme activities in
   the zebrafish changed significantly, and these effects were reversible.
   A metabolic pathway including 13 phase I metabolites and 2 phase II
   metabolites was firstly proposed. A glucuronic acid conjugate and
   sulfate conjugate were observed in zebrafish. The results of this work
   provide information that highlights and can help mitigate the potential
   toxicity of PTA to the ecological environment and humans health.},

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a widely used organophosphate insecticide and potent
   acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, interferes with neurobehavioral
   development. Rat models have been key in demonstrating that
   developmental CPF exposure causes learning deficits and locomotor
   activity alterations, which persist into adulthood. Complementary
   nonmammalian models can be useful in determining the neurodevelopmental
   mechanisms underlying these persisting behavioral effects. Zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) with their clear chorion and extensive developmental
   information base provide an excellent model for assessment of molecular
   processes of toxicant-impacted neurodevelopment. We have developed
   methods for assessing spatial discrimination learning in adult zebrafish
   and have documented persisting effects of developmental CPF exposure on
   swimming activity and learning after low and high doses of CPF (10 and
   100 ng/ml) administered to zebrafish embryos on Days 1-5
   postfertilization (pf). In the current study, we developed methods for
   behavioral assessment of CPF exposure on swimming activity in newly
   hatched zebrafish. An equal area segmented annular grid (concentric
   circles divided into quadrants through the diameter) was made in a 16-mm
   diameter cylinder. The test area was placed on a heating device secured
   to an Olympus SZH 10 dissecting scope stage. Zebrafish embryos were
   exposed to 10 ng/ml CPF, 100 ng/ml CPF, or vehicle control (25 {[}mul/ml
   DMSO) (n=8-10/treatment group). Each treatment group was kept in a total
   volume of 25 ml of egg water (60 mg/ml Instant Ocean) including DMSO
   with or without CPF mixed to above dilutions in an incubator set at
   28.5degreesC. CPF dilutions or vehicle were changed daily with exposure
   ending on Day 5 pf. Testing of larval zebrafish was performed on Days 6
   and 9 pf. The fish were placed in the test cylinder with 1.5 ml of egg
   H(2)0 (28.5degreesC). After a 2-min acclimation period, the swimming
   activity of the fish was measured for a 3-min testing session. The 100
   ng/ml CPF dose caused significant slowing of swimming activity on Days 6
   and 9 pf and had persisting effects of impairing spatial discrimination
   and decreasing response latency in adulthood. Developmental exposure to
   10 ng/ml of CPF did not cause a significant change in locomotor activity
   during the period soon after hatching. CPF exposure during early
   development caused clear behavioral impairments detectable during the
   posthatching period. In a previous study, we found that early
   developmental CPF exposure caused behavioral alterations in zebrafish,
   which lasted throughout adulthood. The molecular mechanisms by which
   early developmental CPF exposure produces these behavioral impairments
   expressed in adulthood can now be studied in the zebrafish model. (C)

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {The fungicide propamocarb (PM) is widely used to protect cucumbers,
   tomatoes and other plants from pathogens. According to previous studies,
   PM could be detected in the aquatic system in some area. However, the
   toxic effects of PM on zebrafish received very limited attention. In
   this study, we examined the toxic effects of various concentration of PM
   on the endpoints of development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress
   in larval zebrafish. It was observed that PM exposure delayed embryonic
   development, inhibited hatchability at 60 and 72 h postfertilization and
   increased heart rate. After PM exposure, the larval zebrafish showed
   abnormal free swimming behavior and the swimming behavior in response to
   light-dark transition, indicating that PM had the potential to induce
   neurotoxicity. Moreover, PM exposure also affected the enzymatic
   activity of acetylcholinesterase and dopamine and the transcriptional
   level of genes related to neurotoxicity. In addition, PM exposure not
   only affects catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity but also affects the
   transcription level of various genes. We believed that PM induced
   oxidative stress was also a possible reason to cause neurotoxicity in
   larval zebrafish. In summary, our results suggested that PM could
   disturb the endpoints at development, locomotor behavior and oxidative
   stress in larval zebrafish. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The agricultural use of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI)
   fungicides has increased dramatically in the US and Europe. As the SDHI
   fungicides, boscalid, flutolanil and thifluzamide had been reported to
   induce a series of toxic effects on zebrafish. However, the toxic
   effects of penthiopyrad on zebrafish have not been reported yet. This
   study aimed to assess the acute toxicity of penthiopyrad to zebrafish in
   early life stages and investigate behavioural response of larvae and the
   effects on lipid metabolism and pigmentation under sub-lethal exposure
   of penthiopyrad. Based on results of the acute toxicity tests of
   zebrafish embryo and larvae, penthiopyrad had an acute toxicity to
   early-life stages of zebrafish and induced a series of deformities
   during development. Based on the results of sub-lethal exposure for 8
   days, penthiopyrad resulted in significant decreases in swimming
   velocity, acceleration speed, distance moved and inactive time of larvae
   at 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/L. Penthiopyrad induced the disorders of lipid
   metabolism via affecting fatty acid synthesis and beta-oxidation, in

   cholesterol and the expression of key genes (hmgcr alpha, ppar alpha 1,
   srebf1, cyp51 and acca1) at 1.2 mg/L. In addition, the disorder of
   melanin synthesis and distribution was caused by penthiopyrad in larvae

Abstract = {The acute effects of the organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion on
   Dicentrarchus labrax juveniles were investigated through a bioassay
   using biomarkers and swimming behaviour as effect criteria. After 96 h
   of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion, the swimming
   velocity and several biomarkers were individually determined, namely:
   brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; muscle cholinesterases
   (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities;
   liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases,
   glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide
   dismutase (SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). A
   significant decrease of the swimming velocity (LOEC = 2 mg l(-1)), an
   inhibition of both AChE (LOEC = 0.06 mg l(-1)) and ChE activities (LOEC
   = 0.03 mg l(-1)), and a positive and significant correlation between the
   swimming velocity and AChE were found in exposed fish, suggesting an
   influence of the inhibition of these enzymes in the swimming velocity
   decrease. An increase of EROD activity (LOEC = 1 mg l(-1)), indicating
   the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a
   negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming
   velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow
   be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD
   (LOEC = 0.13 mg l(-1)) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme
   is preventing oxidative stress damage. No significant alterations were
   found in any of the other parameters tested. Thus, exposure of seabass
   to fenitrothion in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested
   here may have adverse consequences at population level as
   neurotransmission and swimming ability are essential for fish
   performance and survival.},

Title = {Zebrafish as an in vivo model for sustainable chemical design},
Journal = {GREEN CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Heightened public awareness about the many thousands of chemicals in use
   and present as persistent contaminants in the environment has increased
   the demand for safer chemicals and more rigorous toxicity testing. There
   is a growing recognition that the use of traditional test models and
   empirical approaches is impractical for screening for toxicity the many
   thousands of chemicals in the environment and the hundreds of new
   chemistries introduced each year. These realities coupled with the green
   chemistry movement have prompted efforts to implement more
   predictive-based approaches to evaluate chemical toxicity early in
   product development. While used for many years in environmental
   toxicology and biomedicine, zebrafish use has accelerated more recently
   in genetic toxicology, high throughput screening (HTS), and behavioral
   testing. This review describes major advances in these testing methods
   that have positioned the zebrafish as a highly applicable model in
   chemical safety evaluations and sustainable chemistry efforts. Many
   toxic responses have been shown to be shared among fish and mammals
   owing to their generally well-conserved development, cellular networks,
   and organ systems. These shared responses have been observed for
   chemicals that impair endocrine functioning, development, and
   reproduction, as well as those that elicit cardiotoxicity and
   carcinogenicity, among other diseases. HTS technologies with zebrafish
   enable screening large chemical libraries for bioactivity that provide
   opportunities for testing early in product development. A compelling
   attribute of the zebrafish centers on being able to characterize
   toxicity mechanisms across multiple levels of biological organization
   from the genome to receptor interactions and cellular processes leading
   to phenotypic changes such as developmental malformations. Finally,
   there is a growing recognition of the links between human and wildlife
   health and the need for approaches that allow for assessment of real
   world multi-chemical exposures. The zebrafish is poised to be an
   important model in bridging these two conventionally separate areas of
   toxicology and characterizing the biological effects of chemical
   mixtures that could augment its role in sustainable chemistry.},

Title = {Developmental origins of neurotransmitter and transcriptome alterations

Abstract = {Atrazine is an herbicide applied to agricultural crops and is indicated
   to be an endocrine disruptor. Atrazine is frequently found to
   contaminate potable water supplies above the maximum contaminant level
   of 3 mu g/L as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The
   developmental origin of adult disease hypothesis suggests that toxicant
   exposure during development can increase the risk of certain diseases
   during adulthood. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease
   progression are still unknown. In this study, zebrafish embryos were
   exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 mu g/L atrazine throughout embryogenesis.
   Larvae were then allowed to mature under normal laboratory conditions
   with no further chemical treatment until 7 days post fertilization (dpf)
   or adulthood and neurotransmitter analysis completed. No significant
   alterations in neurotransmitter levels was observed at 7 dpf or in adult
   males, but a significant decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
   and serotonin turnover was seen in adult female brain tissue.
   Transcriptomic analysis was completed on adult female brain tissue to
   identify molecular pathways underlying the observed neurological
   alterations. Altered expression of 1928, 89, and 435 genes in the
   females exposed to 0.3, 3, or 30 mu g/L atrazine during embryogenesis
   were identified, respectively. There was a high level of overlap between
   the biological processes and molecular pathways in which the altered
   genes were associated. Moreover, a subset of genes was down regulated
   throughout the serotonergic pathway. These results provide support of
   the developmental origins of neurological alterations observed in adult
   female zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis. (C) 2015

Title = {Assessing the toxicity of the benzamide fungicide zoxamide in zebrafish
   (Danio rerio): Towards an adverse outcome pathway for beta-tubulin
   inhibitors},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Commercial benzamide fungicides are applied to crops to control damage
   caused by oomycete fungi and are used as veterinary pharmaceuticals in
   aquaculture. The mechanism of action of these fungicides is to induce
   mitotic arrest via binding to beta-tubulin, thus inhibiting tubulin
   polymerization. However, there are little toxicity data available for
   benzimidazole fungicides in fish. To address this knowledge gap, we
   conducted zebrafish embryo toxicity tests to assess deformities,
   survival, and sub-lethal responses following exposure to zoxamide (0,
   0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mu M zoxamide). We hypothesized that skeletal
   deformities would be prevalent in zebrafish due to its mechanism of
   inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization. Zoxamide was relatively toxic to
   zebrafish embryos and larvae, and survival was reduced similar to 50 \%
   at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) with 10 mu M exposure and over time
   at 6 dpf, 2.5 mu M exposure reduced survival by similar to 20 \%.
   Frequency of hatch was also reduced/delayed in zebrafish at 3 dpf with >
   2.5 mu M zoxamide. Pericardial edema, body length shortening, and spine
   curvature were observed in larvae exposed to > 5 mu M. Mitochondrial
   bioenergetics were assessed in similar to 30 hpf embryos (24-hour
   exposure) using an XFe24 Flux Analyzer and regression analysis revealed
   a negative relationship between basal respiration and zoxamide
   concentration. Superoxide dismutase 1 and caspase 3 mRNA levels were
   both decreased in 6 dpf larvae exposed to 2.5 mu M zoxamide, but were
   not changed in expression at 0.5 nor 1 mu M zoxamide. Continuous 6-day
   exposure to zoxamide reduced larval activity at 2.5 mu M; conversely a
   24-hour exposure (at 5-6 dpf) induced hyperactivity at 5 mu M suggesting
   dose and time dependent effects on fish behavior. Based on sub-lethal
   endpoints, we conceptualize an adverse outcome pathway for chemicals
   that inhibit tubulin polymerization.},

Abstract = {Paraquat (PQ) administration consists in a chemical model that mimics
   phenotypes observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), due to its ability to
   induce changes in dopaminergic system and oxidative stress. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the actions of PQ in behavioral functions of
   adult zebrafish and its influence on oxidative stress biomarkers in
   brain samples. PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six
   injections for 16 days (one injection every 3 days). PQ-treated group
   showed a significant decrease in the time spent in the bottom section
   and a shorter latency to enter the top area in the novel tank test.
   Moreover, PQ-exposed fish showed a significant decrease in the number
   and duration of risk assessment episodes in the light-dark test, as well
   as an increase in the agonistic behavior in the mirror-induced
   aggression (MIA) test. PQ induced brain damage by decreasing
   mitochondrial viability. Concerning the antioxidant defense system, PQ
   increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, as
   well as the non-protein sulfhydryl content (NPSH), but did not change
   ROS formation and decreased lipid peroxidation. We demonstrate, for the
   first time, that PQ induces an increase in aggressive behavior, alters
   non-motor patterns associated to defensive behaviors, and changes redox
   parameters in zebrafish brain. Overall, our findings may serve as useful
   tools to investigate the interaction between behavioral and
   neurochemical impairments triggered by PQ administration in zebrafish.},

Title = {Tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate exposure to zebrafish causes
   neurodevelopmental toxicity and abnormal locomotor behavior},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {758},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The organophosphate flame retardant, tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate
   (TCPP), is ubiquitous in environmental matrices; however, there is a
   paucity of information concerning its systemic toxicity. Herein, we
   investigated the effects of TCPP exposure on zebrafish neurodevelopment
   and swimming behavior to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms
   of neurotoxicity. Under TCPP gradient concentration exposure, the
   hatching rates were declined by up to 33.3\% in 72 hpf, and the
   malformation rates increased from 15\% to 50\%. Meanwhile, TCPP led to
   abnormal behaviors including decreased locomotive activity in the dark
   and slow/insensitive responses to sound and light stimulation of larvae.
   TCPP caused excessive apoptosis and ROS accumulation in early embryonic
   development, with hair cell defects and structural deformity of
   neuromast. Abnormal expression of neurodevelopment (pax6a, nova1,
   sox11b, syn2a, foxo3a and robo2) and apoptosis-related genes (baxa,
   bcl2a and casp8) revealed molecular mechanisms regarding abnormal
   behavioral and phenotypic symptoms. Chronic TCPP exposure led to
   anxiety-like behavior and excessive panic, lower capacity for
   discrimination and risk avoidance, and conditioned place preference in
   adults. Social interaction tests demonstrated that long-term TCPP stress
   resulted in unsociable, eccentric, lonely and silent behaviors in
   adults. Zebrafish memory and cognitive function were severely reduced as
   concluded fromT-maze tests. Potential mechanisms triggering behavioral
   abnormality were attributed to histopathological injury of diencephalon,
   abnormal changes in nerve-related genes at transcription and expression
   levels, and inhibited activity of AChE by TCPP stress. These findings
   provide an important reference for risk assessment and early warning to
   TCPP exposure, and offer insights for prevention/mitigation of
   pollutant-induced nervous system diseases. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Perturbation of metabonome of embryo/larvae zebrafish after exposure to

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {39-45},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The escalating demand for fipronil by the increasing insects' resistance
   to synthetic pyrethroids placed a burden on aquatic vertebrates.
   Although awareness regarding the toxicity of fipronil to fish is
   arising, the integral alteration caused by fipronil remains unexplored.
   Here, we investigated on the development toxicity of fipronil and the
   metabolic physiology perturbation at 120 h post fertilization through
   GC-MS metabolomics on zebrafish embryo. We observed that fipronil
   dose-dependently induced malformations including uninflated swim bladder
   and bent spine. Further, the ``omic{''} technique hit 26 differential
   metabolites after exposure to fipronil and five significant signaling
   pathways. We speculated that changes in primary bile acid synthesis
   pathway and the content of saturated fatty acid in the chemical-related
   group indicated the liver toxicity. Pathway of Aminoacyl-tRNA
   biosynthesis changed by fipronil may relate to the macromolecular
   synthesis. Concurrently, methane metabolism pathway was also identified
   while the role in zebrafish needs further determination. Overall, this
   study revealed several new signaling pathways in fipronil-treated
   zebrafish embryo/larval. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {170},

Abstract = {Broad applications and exposure to the fungicide maneb can lead to
   toxicity in non-target organisms. Maneb is also associated with
   neurogenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The
   objectives of this study were to determine the acute toxicity of maneb
   to zebrafish by measuring mitochondrial bioenergetics, locomotor
   activity, and the expression of genes related to the oxidative damage
   response, as well as those related to dopamine signaling due to its
   association with PD. Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf)
   were exposed to either solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of
   0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 mu M maneb for 96 h. Maneb was moderately toxic
   to zebrafish embryos, and had a 96-h LC(50 )value of 4.29 mu M (similar
   to 1.14 mg/L). Maneb induced a dose-dependent increase in mortality,
   decreased hatching rate, and increased notochord deformity rate at both
   1.0 and 10.0 mu M after 72 and 96 h. Total body length was also
   significantly reduced with 1.0 mu M maneb. A 50-60\% decrease in mean
   basal oxygen consumption rate was also observed in embryos following a
   24 hpf exposure to 10.0 mu M maneb but oligomycin-induced ATP production
   and FCCP-induced maximum respiration remained unaffected. No change was
   detected in the expression levels of genes associated with oxidative
   stress (sodl and sod2), nor those related to dopamine synthesis (th1),
   dopamine transporter (dat), dopamine receptors (drd1, drd2a, drd3, and
   drd4b). Thus, modifying the expression of these transcripts may not be a
   mechanism for maneb-induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish. To
   assess the potential for neurotoxicity, a dark photokinesis assay was
   conducted in larvae following 7 d exposure to 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mu M
   maneb. Larvae exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 mu M maneb showed signs related to
   hypoactivity, and this reduced activity is hypothesized to be associated
   with notochord defects as this deformity was prevalent at higher
   concentrations of maneb. Overall, these data demonstrate that maneb
   negatively affects embryonic development (i.e. notochord development),
   affects basal oxygen consumption rates of embryos, and induces
   hypoactivity in larval fish. This study improves understanding regarding
   the developmental neurotoxicity of the fungicide maneb to zebrafish.},

Title = {Clethodim exposure induces developmental immunotoxicity and
   neurobehavioral dysfunction in zebrafish embryos},
Journal = {FISH \& SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {549-558},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, but
   its potential negative effects on aquatic organisms are still poorly
   understood. This study examined the effects of clethodim on zebrafish at
   aspects of early stage embryonic development, immune toxicity, cell
   apoptosis and locomotor behavior. Firstly, clethodim exposure markedly
   decreased the survival rate, body length, and heart rate and resulted in
   a series of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities
   (SD) and yolk sac edema, in zebrafish larvae. Secondly, the number of
   immune cells was substantially reduced but the levels of apoptosis and
   oxidative stress were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner
   upon clethodim exposure. Thirdly, we evaluated the expression of some
   key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappa B p65 and
   they were all up regulated by exposure to 300 mu g/L clethodim.
   Meanwhile, some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta,
   IL8, and IFN-gamma were also activated in both the mock and the TLR4-KD
   conditions. Moreover, the locomotor behaviors and the enzymatic
   activities of AChE were obviously inhibited but the levels of acetylated
   histone H3 were greatly increased by clethodim exposure. In addition,
   incubation of zebrafish larvae with acetylcholine receptor (AChR)
   agonist carbachol can partially rescue the clethodim-modulated locomotor
   behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that clethodim has the
   potential to induce developmental immunotoxicity and cause behavioral
   alterations in zebrafish larvae. The information presented in this study
   will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying clethodim
   exposure in aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Reproductive toxicity of long-term exposure to environmental relevant
   concentrations of cyprodinil in female zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {846},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {In recent years, the widespread use of the pesticide cyprodinil has
   attracted attention due to its harmful effects on aquatic organisms. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the adverse effects of long-term
   exposure to cyprodinil on the reproductive system of female zebrafish.
   After the embryos had been treated with 0.1,1 and 10 mu g/L cyprodinil
   for 180 days, we observed that female fish treated with 1 and 10 mu g/L
   cyprodinil showed decreased sexual attractive-ness, a decreased
   proportion of primordial follicles in the ovary, an increased proportion
   of mature follicles, and in-creased egg production. Moreover, exposed
   females that mated with normal males produced offspring with increased
   rates of mortality and deformity (the F1 generation). In addition, the
   levels of gonadotropin and testosterone (T) were increased in females
   after cyprodinil exposure, especially in the 10 mu g/L treated group.
   After cyprodinil treat-ment, some key genes in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis underwent significant changes. For
   example, gene ex-pression of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone
   receptors (gnrhr1, gnrhr2 and gnrhr4) was significantly downregulated
   after cyprodinil treatment. The study found that expression of the
   aromatase (cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1a,
   cyp19a1a) responsible for converting T into estradiol was significantly
   downregulated after cyprodinil treatment, consistent with elevated T
   levels in the ovaries and muscles. In summary, these data provide a more
   comprehensive understanding of the toxicity of cyprodinil and may inform
   evaluation of the ecotoxicity of cyprodinil to female reproduction at
   environmentally relevant concentrations.},

Abstract = {Dieldrin (DLD) is a lipophilic pesticide that shows environmental
   persistence. The objectives were to determine the effects of DLD on
   GABAergic and dopaminergic systems in developing zebrafish. Both
   chorionated and dechorionated embryos (similar to 24 h post-hatch) were
   exposed to a single concentration of DLD (0347-3470 mu M) for 48 h.
   Following exposure, a subset of larvae was placed into clean water for 6
   days (i.e. depuration phase). Chorionated embryos showed <15\% mortality
   while dechorionated embryos showed higher mortality (>30\%), suggesting
   that the chorion protected the embryos. Over a 6 day depuration phase,
   there was a dose dependent effect observed in both the ``dechorionated
   and chorionated embryo{''} treatments for larval mortality (>60\%). At
   the end of depuration, there was no detectable change in
   neuro-morphological endpoints that included the ratio of notochord
   length to body length (\%) and the ratio of head area to body area (\%).
   However, DLD did induce cardiac edema, skeletal deformities, and
   tremors. GABA-related transcripts were not affected in abundance by DLD.
   Conversely, the relative mRNA levels of dopamine transporter (data) and
   dopamine receptor drd2a mRNA were decreased in dechorionated, but not
   chorionated, embryos. These data suggest that DLD can alter the
   expression of transcripts related to dopaminergic signaling. Lastly,
   GABA(A) receptor subunits gabrB1 and gabrB2, as well as dopamine
   receptors drdl and drd2a, were inherently higher in abundance in
   dechorionated embryos compared to chorionated embryos. This is an
   important consideration when incorporating transcriptomics into embryo

Title = {Photomotor Response Data Analysis Approach to Assess Chemical
   Neurotoxicity with the Zebrafish Embryo},
Journal = {ALTEX-ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The photomotor response (PMR) of zebrafish embryos, a light
   pulse-triggered undirected movement, is known to be altered by
   neuroactive chemicals. Here, we developed an approach for data analysis
   of the distribution of PMR movement activities along the time axis;
   differences between treatment and respective controls are expressed by
   an aggregated value integrating the time-resolved density of the
   movement parameter as a measure for a chemically elicited PMR effect.
   Logistic concentration-PMR effect relationships were modeled for
   neuroactive test compounds with different modes of action
   (acetylcholinesterase inhibition, activation and inhibition of
   voltage-gated sodium channels); 50\% effect concentrations (EC50) were
   in the low to medium mu M range (EC50 10 mu M for flucythrinate,
   esfenvalerate, azinphos-methyl, propoxur; EC50 10 mu M for tricaine).
   Modulation of movement activities in different phases of the PMR (i.e.,
   ``fingerprint{''}) by neuroactive test compounds varied across
   concentrations, showing that mode of action-specific PMR fingerprints
   are also concentration-dependent. Above concentrations causing 10\%
   lethality (LC10; 48 h), 3,4-dichloroaniline caused movement inhibition.
   This substance presumably is not neuroactive; its effect on the PMR
   therefore is considered a secondary toxic effect. Quantitative
   morphological examinations of chemically exposed embryos showed that
   malformations occurred only above PMR effect concentrations, indicating
   that changes in the PMR were not due to such indirect effects. The PMR
   assay will provide a useful measure in ecotoxicological risk assessment
   of neuroactive chemicals with zebrafish embryos and could potentially be
   used to infer acute fish toxicity levels from PMR effect concentrations
   of neurotoxic compounds.},

   and Activate Apoptotic Caspases in Human Breast Carcinoma Cells},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {New isopropylated fused azaisocytosine-containing congeners (I-VI) have
   previously been reported as promising anticancer drug candidates, so
   further research on these molecules in the preclinical development phase
   is fully justified and necessary. For this reason, in the present paper,
   we assess the toxicity/safety profiles of all the compounds using Danio
   rerio and red blood cell models, and examine the effect of the most
   selective congeners on the activation of apoptotic caspases in cancer
   and normal cells. In order to evaluate the effect of each molecule on
   the development of zebrafish embryos/larvae and to select the safest
   compounds for further study, various phenotypic parameters (i.e.,
   mortality, hatchability, heart rate, heart oedema, yolk sac utilization,
   swim bladder development and body shape) were observed, and the half
   maximal lethal concentration, the maximal non-lethal concentration and
   no observed adverse effect concentration for each compound were
   established. The effect of all the isopropylated molecules was compared
   to that of an anticancer agent pemetrexed. The lipophilicity-dependent
   structure-toxicity correlations were also determined. To establish the
   possible interaction of the compounds with red blood cells, an ex vivo
   hemolysis test was performed. It was shown that almost all of the
   investigated isopropylated congeners have no adverse phenotypic effect
   on zebrafish development during five-day exposure at concentrations up
   to 50 mu M (I-III) or up to 20 mu M (IV-V), and that they are less toxic
   for embryos/larvae than pemetrexed, demonstrating their safety. At the
   same time, all the molecules did not adversely affect the red blood
   cells, which confirms their very good hemocompatibility. Moreover, they
   proved to be activators of apoptotic caspases, as they increased
   caspase-3, -7 and -9 levels in human breast carcinoma cells. The
   conducted research allows us to select-from among the anticancer active
   drug candidates-compounds that are safe for developing zebrafish and red
   blood cells, suitable for further in vivo pharmacological tests.},

Abstract = {Environmental exposure to tricresyl phosphate (TCP) may lead to severe
   neurotoxic effects, including organophosphate (OP)-induced delayed
   neuropathy. TCP has three symmetric isomers, distinguished by the methyl
   group position on the aromatic ring system. One of these isomers,
   tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCP), has been reported for years as a
   neuropathic OP, targeting neuropathic target esterase (NTE/PNPLA6), but
   its mode of toxic action had not been fully elucidated. Zebrafish
   eleuthero-embryo and larva were used to characterize the differential
   action of the TCP isomers. The symmetric isomers inhibited phenyl
   valerate (PV)-NTE enzymatic activity in vivo with different IC50, while
   no effect was observed on acetylcholinesterase activity. Moreover, the
   locomotor behavior was also affected by tri-para-cresyl phosphate and
   tri-meta-cresyl phosphate, only ToCP exposure led to locomotor
   hyperactivity lasting several hours, associated with defects in the
   postural control system and an impaired phototactic response, as
   revealed by the visual motor response test. The electric field pulse
   motor response test demonstrated that a seizure-like, multiple
   C-bend-spaghetti phenotype may be significantly induced by ToCP only,
   independently of any inhibition of PV-NTE activity. Eleuthero-embryos
   exposed to picrotoxin, a known gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor
   inhibitor, exhibited similar adverse outcomes to ToCP exposure. Thus,
   our results demonstrated that the TCP mode of toxic action was isomer
   specific and not initially related to modulation of PV-NTE activity.
   Furthermore, it was suggested that the molecular events involved were
   linked to an impairment of the balance between excitation and inhibition
   in neuronal circuits.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {220},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Sulfometuron methyl (SM) is a widely used herbicide and thus leading to
   accumulation in the environment. The toxicity assessments of SM in model
   organisms are currently rare. In the present study, zebrafish were
   utilized for evaluating the detrimental effects of SM in aquatic
   vertebrates. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM
   from 5.5 to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf), respectively. Consequently,
   SM exposure resulted in increasing the mortality rate and reducing
   hatching rate in larval zebrafish at 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated
   groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells (neutrophils and
   macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent manner.
   The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1I3, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y,
   IL-10, and TGF-I3) were measured to estimate immune responses.
   Anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-I3) were downregulated in all
   the treated groups and significantly altered at 40 mg/L exposure group.
   Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that SM treatment significantly
   increased the total distance, average speed, and maximum acceleration of
   larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and subsequently
   enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The
   content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS
   level in all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were
   significantly increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration
   group induced the substantial increment (P < 0.001) of apoptosis-related
   genes including p53, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3. In summary,
   our results demonstrated that exposure to SM caused toxicity of
   development, immune system, locomotor behavior, oxidative stress, and
   cell apoptosis at the early developmental stages of zebrafish.},

Title = {Developmental exposure of zebrafish larvae to organophosphate flame
   retardants causes neurotoxicity},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {16-22},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {With the gradual ban on brominated flame retardants (FRs), the
   application of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has increased
   remarkably. Considering the structural similarity between OPFRs and
   organophosphate pesticides, hypotheses that OPFRs may interfere with
   neurodevelopment as organophosphate pesticides are reasonable. In this
   study, the neurotoxicity of three OPFRs, including tri-n-butyl phosphate
   (TNBP), tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris (2-chloroethyl)
   phosphate (TCEP), was evaluated in zebrafish larvae and then compared
   with the neurotoxicity of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF).
   The results showed that similar to CPF, exposure to OPFRs for 5 days
   resulted in significant changes in locomotor behavior, either in free
   swimming or in photomotor response. However, given the transcriptional
   changes that occur in nervous system genes in response to OPFRs and CPF,
   as well as the altered enzyme activity of AChE and its mRNA level, the
   underlying mechanisms for neurotoxicity among these organophosphate
   chemicals might be varied. In summary, the results confirm the potential
   neurodevelopmental toxicity of OPFRs and underscore the importance of
   identifying the mechanistic targets of the OPFRs with specific moieties.
   Furthermore, as the neurobehavioral responses are well conserved among
   vertebrates and the exposure of children to OPFRs is significant, a
   thorough assessment of the risk of OPFRs exposure during early
   development should be highly emphasized in future studies. (C) 2016

   Hyperactivation Following Acute Organophosphate Poisoning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Organophosphate (OP) compounds include highly toxic chemicals widely
   used both as pesticides and as warfare nerve agents. Existing
   countermeasures are lifesaving, but do not alleviate all long-term
   neurological sequelae, making OP poisoning a public health concern
   worldwide and the search for fully efficient antidotes an urgent need.
   OPs cause irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, inducing
   the so-called cholinergic syndrome characterized by peripheral
   manifestations and seizures associated with permanent psychomotor
   deficits. Besides immediate neurotoxicity, recent data have also
   identified neuroinflammation and microglia activation as two processes
   that likely play an important, albeit poorly understood, role in the
   physiopathology of OP intoxication and its long-term consequences. To
   gain insight into the response of microglia to OP poisoning, we used a
   previously described model of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)
   intoxication of zebrafish larvae. This model reproduces almost all the
   defects seen in poisoned humans and preclinical models, including AChE
   inhibition, neuronal epileptiform hyperexcitation, and increased
   neuronal death. Here, we investigated in vivo the consequences of acute
   DFP exposure on microglia morphology and behaviour, and on the
   expression of a set of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. We also
   used a genetic method of microglial ablation to evaluate the role in the
   OP-induced neuropathology. We first showed that DFP intoxication rapidly
   induced deep microglial phenotypic remodelling resembling that seen in
   M1-type activated macrophages and characterized by an amoeboid
   morphology, reduced branching, and increased mobility. DFP intoxication
   also caused massive expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory
   cytokines Il1 beta, Tnf alpha, Il8, and to a lesser extent,
   immuno-modulatory cytokine Il4, suggesting complex microglial
   reprogramming that included neuroinflammatory activities. Finally,
   microglia-depleted larvae were instrumental in showing that microglia
   were major actors in DFP-induced neuroinflammation and, more
   importantly, that OP-induced neuronal hyperactivation was markedly
   reduced in larvae fully devoid of microglia. DFP poisoning rapidly
   triggered massive microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, probably as a
   result of DFP-induced neuronal hyperexcitation, which in turn further
   exacerbated neuronal activation. Microglia are thus a relevant
   therapeutic target, and identifying substances reducing microglial
   activation could add efficacy to existing OP antidote cocktails.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {291},

Abstract = {Pesticides are crucial to improve agricultural productivity, but often
   adversely affect surrounding aquatic systems and their fauna. To
   determine the environmental risk of pesticides, routine ecotoxicological
   tests are performed on several organisms, including standard fish
   models. However, these typically do not include fish species from
   variable habitats and with non-generic life-histories. In particular,
   inhabitants from temporary ponds such as annual killifish are
   conventionally understood to be resilient to natural stressors which
   could translate to higher pesticide resistance or, alternatively,
   trade-off with their resistance to pesticides and render them more
   sensitive than classic fish models. Using standard exposure tests, we
   assessed short-term toxicity effects of two commonly used pesticides,
   Roundup and cypermethrin, on the annual killifish Nothobranchius
   neumanni, and compared its sensitivity with that of classic fish models.
   For Roundup, we found a 72 h-LC50 of 1.79 +/- 0.11 mg/L, which is lower
   than the values reported for zebrafish, medaka, fathead minnow and
   rainbow trout, suggesting that N. neumanni is more sensitive to the
   compound. The opposite was true for cypermethrin, with a 72 h-LC50 of
   0.27 +/- 0.03 mg/L. However, these LC50-values do not deviate strongly
   from those reported for other fish species, supporting earlier findings
   in the congeneric N. furzeri that the sensitivity of annual killifish to
   pollutants is similar to that of classic fish models despite their
   assumed robustness to environmental stress.},

   reduced the mRNA expression of tight-junction genes (occludin,
   claudin-2, and ZO-1) in the brain, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
   activity was clearly inhibited by high concentrations of GLY. However,
   different concentrations of PE-MPs had no significant effect on the
   activity of AChE. Furthermore, the free-swimming behavior of common carp
   was distinctly inhibited by treatment with a combination of 15 mg/L GLY
   and 4.5 mg/L PE-MPs. Histological studies indicated that PE-MPs alone
   and in combination with GLY could disrupt the physical and chemical
   intestinal barriers of common carp. Additionally, the abundance and
   diversity of gut microbiota in common carp were significantly changed

   compounds and potential metabolism by the embryos was studied for
   albendazole, febantel, fenbendazole and oxfendazole. Newly fertilized
   zebrafish eggs were exposed under static conditions in 96-well plates
   for 6 days to the pharmaceuticals: 5 antibacterials and 10
   antiparasitics. Endpoints including mortality, malformations and other
   sublethal responses were recorded at 24, 48 and 144 h post fertilization
   (hpf). The pharmaceuticals causing the highest toxicity were
   antiparasitics whereas the tested antibacterials, danofloxacin,
   enrofloxacin, tylosine, trimethoprim and oxytetracyclin had a much lower
   toxic potency in zebrafish embryos. Most toxic were fenbendazole,
   albendazole and flumethrin with no observed effect concentrations
   (NOECs) around 0.02 mg/L. The overall NOEC was determined by lethality
   for the following pharmaceuticals: albendazole, fenbendazole and
   oxfendazole. Sublethal endpoints, including malformations, side-laying
   embryos, tremors, reduced movements and altered heart rate increased the
   sensitivity of the tests and determined the overall NOECs for febantel,
   doramectin, ivermectin, flumethrin and toltrazuril. Exposure to
   doramectin and ivermectin caused a decrease in movements at 24 hpf and a
   decrease in heart rate at 48 hpf. Flumethrin exposure resulted in
   decreased time to hatching, except at the highest concentrations, and
   caused an increase in heart rate at 48 hpf. In contrast, toltrazuril
   caused an increased time to hatching and a decrease in heart rate.
   Chemical analysis of the exposure medium after the tests revealed great
   differences between nominal and measured concentrations, emphasizing the
   need of including analysis of the actual exposure concentrations. The
   results indicated that metabolism of albendazole into its sulfoxide
   protected the embryos from toxicity. Albendazole was metabolized
   efficiently into albendazole sulfoxide at lower exposure concentrations,
   resulting in reduced toxicity. At higher concentrations, an increasing
   proportion of albendazole remained unmetabolized and embryo mortality
   occurred. Metabolism by the embryos of febantel into fenbendazole and
   oxfendazole and of fenbendazole into oxfendazole was demonstrated. It is
   suggested that the toxic effect of febantel in zebrafish embryos is due
   to metabolism into fenbendazole. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Toxic effects and potential mechanisms of Fluxapyroxad to zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) embryos},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {769},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Fluxapyroxad is a broad-spectrum and high-efficiency succinate
   dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicide that can control plant fungal
   pathogens on many crops. However, fluxapyroxad can enter the aquatic
   environment when applied in the field, which has an impact on the
   aquatic environment. The potential threat and toxicological mechanisms
   of fluxapyroxad in aquatic organisms remain poorly understood. In this
   study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to fluxapyroxad to investigate the
   toxic effects and potential mechanisms of fluxapyroxad. In the acute
   toxicity test, the lethal sensitivity rank of the zebrafish during the
   three stages was larvae (0.699 mg/L) > adult fish (0.913 mg/L) > embryo
   (1.388 mg/L). Fluxapyroxad induced abnormal spontaneous movement,
   malformations and decreased heartbeat, hatching percentage, and body
   length of the embryos. In the sublethal toxicity test, succinate
   dehydrogenase activity was significantly increased in all treatment
   groups, while the activities of the electron transport chain complex II
   and ATPase were markedly inhibited in 0.347 and 0.694 mg/L fluxapyroxad
   groups compared to that of the control group. Exposure to fluxapyroxad
   resulted in significant increases in MDA production, and GPx activity
   was significantly reduced at 0.694 mg/L. Moreover, caspase-3 activity
   was significantly increased in the 0.694 mg/L group, and the expression
   of the genes related to growth (bmp4 and lox) was inhibited after
   fluxapyroxad exposure. These results indicated that oxidative stress,
   cell apoptosis and mitochondrial damage might be the potential mechanism
   underlying the toxic effects of fluxapyroxad on zebrafish embryos. (C)

   Aphanizomenon flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins},

Abstract = {Aphanizomenon flos-aquae secretes paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs),
   termed aphantoxins, and endangers environmental and human health via
   eutrophication of water worldwide. Although the molecular mechanism of
   neuronal PSP toxicity has been well studied, several issues remain
   unresolved, notably the in vivo hepatic antioxidative responses to this
   neurotoxin. Aphantoxins extracted from a natural isolate of A.
   flos-aquae DC-1 were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography.
   The primary components were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 and neosaxitoxin.
   Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated intraperitoneally with either 53 or
   7.61 (low and high doses, respectively) mu g saxitoxin (STX) equivalents
   (eq)/kg of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Antioxidative responses in
   zebrafish liver were examined at different timepoints 1-24 h
   post-exposure. Aphantoxin administration significantly enhanced hepatic
   malondialdehyde (MDA) content 1-12 h post-exposure, indicative of
   oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, levels of reduced
   glutathione (GSH) in zebrafish liver declined significantly after 3-24 h
   exposure, suggesting that GSH participates in MDA metabolism. A
   significant upregulation of the activities of superoxide dismutase
   (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed,
   suggesting that aphantoxins induce lipid peroxidation in zebrafish liver
   and are likely to be hepatotoxic. Hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, and of
   the three enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), therefore provide potential
   biomarkers for studying environmental exposure to aphantoxins/PSPs from
   cyanobacterial blooms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that cyanotoxins can exert neurotoxic
   effects on exposed aquatic organisms but most studies have focused on
   purified toxins rather than on the more complex effects of
   cyanobacterial blooms. To evaluate this issue in an environmentally
   relevant model, we assessed the developmental neurotoxicity induced by
   Microcystis aeruginosa on newly hatched zebrafish. After four days of
   exposure, the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae was significantly
   decreased with increasing algae concentration. The levels of both
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and dopamine (DA) were decreased,
   accompanied by a decline in ache, chrna7 and wolf and a compensatory
   increase in nr4a2b transcription. Furthermore, the expression of nine
   marker genes for nervous system function or development, namely, elavl3,
   gap43, gfap, mbp, nestin, ngn1, nkx2.2a, shha and syn2a, similarly
   decreased after algal exposure. These results demonstrated that
   Microcystis aeruginosa exposure affected cholinergic and dopaminergic
   neurotransmitter systems, the transcription of key nervous system genes,
   and consequently the activity level of larval zebrafish. Importantly,
   discrepancies in the neurotoxic effects observed in this study and in
   previous reports that were based on exposure to pure cyanotoxin
   highlight the necessity for further investigation of cyanobacterial
   bloom mixtures when assessing the ecotoxicity of cyanobacteria.},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Boscalid has been widely used for controlling various plant diseases. It
   is one of the most frequently detected pesticides in main coastal
   estuaries in California, with concentrations as high as 36 mu g/L, but
   its ecotoxicology information is scarce. To assess the aquatic risk of
   boscalid, acute toxicity and sub-lethal developmental toxicity toward
   zebrafish embryos were determined in the present study. In the acute
   toxicity test, a series of toxic symptoms of embryos were observed,
   including abnormal spontaneous movement, slow heartbeat, yolk sac
   oedema, pericardial oedema, spine deformation and hatching inhibition,
   and 96-h-LC50 (50\% lethal concentration) of boscalid toward zebrafish
   embryos was 2.65 (2.506-2.848) mg/L. From the results of the sub-lethal
   developmental toxicity test, boscalid was confirmed to have a great
   impact on development mechanisms of zebrafish embryos. Cell apoptosis in
   embryos was induced by boscalid with upregulation of genes in the cell
   apoptosis and an increase of capspase-3 and caspase-9 activity in the
   present study. Lipid metabolism was affected in embryos due to changes
   in gene expression and the contents of total triacylglyceride and
   cholesterol. Melanin synthesis and deposition was caused in embryos due
   to alterations in related gene expression. Overall, changes in cell
   apoptosis, lipid metabolism and melanin synthesis and deposition might
   be responsible for developmental toxicity of boscalid to zebrafish
   embryos. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) is an important source of
   biologically active compounds with pharmacological potential. The aim of
   this study was to examine the toxicity of different extracts obtained
   from either traditional or organic cultivated yerba mate in vitro and in
   vivo. Aqueous, ethanolic and methanolic extracts were obtained from
   commercial samples of yerba mate and total phenolic content was
   determined employing Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. The aqueous extracts
   presented higher content of total phenols, compared to ethanolic and
   methanolic extracts, and also demonstrated lower cytotoxicity, which is
   the basis for testing were carried out only using aqueous extracts. The
   main phenolic acids found in traditional aqueous (TA) extract were
   chlorogenic, gallic and protocatechuic acids. Gallic and hydroxybenzoic
   acids were detected in aqueous cultivated organic (OA) extract.
   Pretreatment with OA extract (100 mu g/ml, 1 hr) was cytoprotective
   against rotenone-induced toxicity (1 mu M). For in vivo toxicity assay,
   zebrafish embryos were exposed to OA or TA extracts (10-160 mu g/ml) at
   4 hr post fertilization. TA extract decreased embryos survival in a
   concentration-dependent manner, reduced the hatching rate at 40 mu g/ml,
   increased edema frequency at 80 mu g/ml and altered body curvature at
   120 mu g/ml. Further, TA extract produced locomotor disorders at
   concentrations equal to or greater than 10 mu g/ml. In contrast, OA
   extract exhibited no apparent toxic effect on organogenesis and behavior
   up to 100 mu g/ml. In summary, the OA cultivated extract showed the
   lowest cytotoxicity in vitro, enhanced reduction in rotenone-induced
   toxicity, and produced less toxicity in zebrafish embryos compared to
   the TA extract.},

Abstract = {Short-term reproduction assays were conducted with fathead minnow
   (Pimephales promelas) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to evaluate
   responses from atrazine exposure at environmentally relevant
   concentrations and above. Breeding groups of fish with multiple males
   and females were exposed to atrazine under flow-through conditions.
   Fathead minnows were exposed to mean measured concentrations of 1.0, 10,
   26, 52, and 105 mu g atrazine/L for 28 days. Medaka were exposed to mean
   measured concentrations of 9.4, 48, 74, 97, and 244 mu g atrazine/L for
   28 or 29 days. Fish were evaluated for survival, fecundity, fertility,
   total length, wet weight, secondary sex characteristics, gonadosomatic
   index (GSI) (P. promelas only), plasma or hepatic vitellogenin (VTG),
   and histopathology of gonads. General observations of health and
   behaviour were also conducted. There were no statistically significant
   effects (i.e., p < 0.05) of atrazine on survival, size, reproduction,
   behaviour, GSI, VTG, or secondary sex characteristics in either species
   at any exposure level. In fathead minnows, there were no
   histopathological findings associated with atrazine exposure in male
   fish, but there was an increased proportion of Stage 4.0 ovaries
   accompanied by an increase in proportion of Grade 3 post-ovulatory
   follicles in females of the 105 a treatment group. Without a concomitant
   increase in oocyte atresia, neither of these findings are considered
   adverse for the health of the fish. In medaka, there were no significant
   effects of atrazine exposure on histopathology in either sex. These data
   support current weight-of-evidence assessments that atrazine does not
   cause direct adverse effects on fish reproduction at environmentally
   realistic concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fluazinam is a pyridinamine fungicide that induces oxidative stress and
   mitochondrial damage in cells, and it has been reported to be
   neurotoxic. To characterize the biological effects of fluazinam, we
   assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics, dopamine system expression, and
   behavior of early life staged zebrafish (0.01 mu M-0.5 mu M) Fluazinam
   at environmentally-relevant levels did not induce sub-lethal effects in
   larvae, but at the LC50 (0.5 mu M), fluazinam decreased basal and
   ATP-linked respiration significantly in embryos. As mitochondria are
   directly related to redox homeostasis and apoptosis, the expression of
   genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured.
   Superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), heat stock protein 70 (hsp70),
   bcl2-associated X protein (bax), and caspase 9 (casp9) mRNA levels were
   up-regulated by 0.5 mu M fluazinam. Taken together, there was evidence
   for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage at the highest
   concentration of fluazinam (0.5 pM) tested. As there are reports for
   fluazinam-induced neurotoxicity in dopamine synthesizing cells,
   transcriptional targets in the dopamine system were assessed in the
   zebrafish. Tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine receptor 2a (drd2a)
   mRNA levels were decreased by 0.5 mu M fluazinam, suggesting that this
   fungicide may affect the dopaminergic system. To further assess the
   potential for fluazinam-mediated neuromodulation, the dark photokinesis
   response was assessed in larvae following exposure. Larvae exposed to
   0.1 mu M fluazinam showed hyperactivity, while larvae exposed to 0.2 and
   03 mu M showed hypo-activity. This study demonstrates that fluazinam
   disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics in zebrafish, inducing an oxidative
   stress response, and aberrant behaviors in larvae that are dose
   dependent. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Human exposure to organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) is
   widespread, including pregnant women and young children with whom
   developmental neurotoxic risk is a concern. Given similarities of OPFRs
   to organophosphate (OP) pesticides, research into the possible
   neurotoxic impacts of developmental OPFR exposure has been growing.
   Building upon research implicating exposure to OP pesticides in
   dopaminergic (DA) dysfunction, we exposed developing zebrafish to the
   OPFR tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), during the first 5
   days following fertilization. On day 6, larvae were challenged with
   acute administration of dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptor antagonists and
   then tested in a light-dark locomotor assay. We found that both
   developmental TDCIPP exposure and acute dopamine D-1 and D-2 antagonism
   decreased locomotor activity separately. The OPFR and DA effects were
   not additive; rather, TDCIPP blunted further D-1 and D-2
   antagonist-induced decreases in activity. Our results suggest that
   TDCIPP exposure may be disrupting dopamine signaling. These findings
   support further research on the effects of OPFR exposure on the normal
   neurodevelopment of DA systems, whether these results might persist into
   adulthood, and whether they interact with OPFR effects on other
   neurotransmitter systems in producing the developmental neurobehavioral

Title = {Atrazine exposure in zebrafish induces aberrant genome-wide methylation},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most common agricultural herbicide used in
   the United States and is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC).
   Developmental exposure to ATZ can lead to significant behavioral and
   morphological alterations in exposed animals and their progeny
   suggesting the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism. Specific
   epigenetic mechanisms responsible for these alterations, however, are
   yet to be elucidated. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to 0,
   0.3, 3, or 30 ppb (mu g/L) of ATZ from 1 to 72 h post fertilization
   (hpf). Chemical exposure was ceased and zebrafish maintained until 9
   months post fertilization (mpf), when wholegenome bisulfite sequencing
   (WGBS) was performed to assess the effects of embryonic ATZ exposure on
   DNA methylation in female fish brains. The number of differentially
   methylated genes (DMGs) increased with increasing treatment
   concentration. DMGs were enriched in neurological pathways with
   extensive methylation changes consistently observed in neuroendocrine
   pathways. Specifically, DMGs with methylation changes in promoter
   regions showed hypomethylation in estrogen receptor signaling and
   hypermethylation in androgen signaling. DMGs with methylation changes in
   genebody were primarily enriched for mitochondrion-related pathways
   associated with healthy aging. Integrated analysis with transcriptomic
   data at 9 mpf exhibited a similar trend identifying CABLES1 and NDUFA4
   as shared targets at all concentrations. We then compared the predicted
   upstream regulators of transcriptomic changes with DMGs and identified
   CALML3 as a common upstream regulator at both 0.3 and 30 ppb that
   exhibit significant methylation changes. Collectively, our study
   identified long-lasting DNA methylation changes in genome after
   embryonic ATZ exposure and elucidated potential gene targets whose
   aberrant methylation features may drive alterations in gene
   transcription in long-term.},

Abstract = {A PCR array, based on expression of genes along the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver(HPGL) axis of fish, has been
   suggested as a useful method for screening of endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs). However, effects of circadian rhythm on responses of
   the HPGL axis to exposure to chemicals were unknown. In this study,
   profiles of expression of genes along the HPGL axis and concentrations
   of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in blood plasma of female zebrafish were
   compared at two sampling times of day (8:00 AM and 7:00 PM). Prochloraz
   (PCZ) was selected as a model chemical to evaluate differences in
   responses of the HPGL axis at these two times of day. Profiles of
   responses of concentrations of E2 in plasma and expressions of genes
   along the HPGL axis genes were different between the two times of
   sampling. Concentrations of E2 were less, and abundances of mRNA for
   several genes along the HPGL axis were significantly greater or lesser
   when samples were collected at 7:00 PM than they were when samples were
   collected at 8:00 AM. Exposure to three concentrations of PCZ (3, 30 or
   300 mu g/L) for 48 h resulted in significantly lesser concentrations of
   plasma E2 and caused compensatory up-regulation of genes included in
   hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary. Expressions of genes along the HPGL
   were more responsive to PCZ at 8:00 AM than they were when samples were
   collected at 7:00 PM. Correlations among parameters in samples collected
   at the two times indicated the effects might be due to different
   concentrations of E2 in plasma due to exposure to PCZ. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Thiram, a pesticide in the dithiocarbamate chemical family, is widely
   used to prevent fungal disease in seeds and crops. Its off-site movement
   to surface waters occurs and may place aquatic organisms at potential
   harm. Zebrafish embryos were used for investigation of acute (1 h)
   thiram exposure (0.001-10 mu M) at various developmental stages.
   Survival decreased at 1 mu M and 10 mu M and hatching was delayed at 0.1
   mu M and 1 mu M. Notochord curvatures were seen at 0.1 and 1 mu M thiram
   when exposure was initiated at 2 and at 10 hpf. Similar notochord
   curvatures followed exposure to the known TPO inhibitor, methimazole
   (MMI). Changes were absent in embryos exposed at later stages, i.e., 12
   hpf. In embryos exposed to 0.1 or 1 mu M at 10 hpf, levels of the
   thyroid enzyme, Deiodinase 3, increased by 12 hpf. Thyroid peroxide
   (TPO), important in T4 synthesis, decreased by 48 hpf in embryos exposed
   to 1 mu M at 10 hpf. Thiram toxicity was stage-dependent and early life
   stage exposure may be responsible for adverse effects seen later. These
   effects may be due to impacts on the thyroid via regulation of specific
   thyroid genes including TPO and Deiodinase 3.},

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most toxic pesticides in aquatic
   ecosystem, but its toxicity mechanisms to fish are still not fully
   understood. This study examined the toxicity targets of CPF in early
   life stage of zebrafish on the endpoints at developmental toxicity,
   neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity. Firstly, CPF
   exposure decreased the body length, inhibited the hatchability and heart
   rate, and resulted in a number of morphological abnormalities, primarily
   spinal deformities (SD) and pericardial edema (PE), in larval zebrafish.
   Secondly, the free swimming activities and the swimming behaviors of the
   larvae in response to the stimulation of light-to-dark photoperiod
   transition were significantly influenced by the exposure to 100 and 300
   mu g/L CPF. In addition, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
   the transcription of some genes related to neurotoxicity were also
   influenced by CPF exposure. Thirdly, CPF exposure induced oxidative
   stress in the larval zebrafish. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels
   increased and the glutathione (GSH) contents decreased significantly in
   a concentration-dependent manner after the exposure to CPF for 96 hours
   post fertilization (hpf). CPF affected not only the activities of
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX)
   and glutathione S-transferase (GST), but also the transcriptional levels
   of their respective genes. Finally, the mRNA levels of the main
   cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf alpha), interferon
   (Ifn), interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta), interleukin 6 (116), complement
   factor 4 (C4) in the larvae increased significantly after the exposure
   to 100 or 300 mu g/L CPF for 96 hpf, suggesting that the innate immune
   system disturbed by CPF in larvae. Taken together, our results suggested
   that CPF had the potential to cause developmental toxicity, behavior
   alterations, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in the larval
   zebrafish. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the bioaccumulation and toxicity of hexaconazole
   (HEX) in spite of the fact that they are indispensable parts for a
   comprehensive assessment of its environmental behavior and toxic effects
   in organisms of freshwater ecosystems. In this study, adult zebrafish
   were used to study the enantioselective bioaccumulation of HEX and its
   effect endpoints in liver, including oxidative stress and the regulation
   of apoptosis-related gene expression. Significant enantioselective
   bioaccumulation was demonstrated when exposed to HEX of 100 and 200 mu g
   L-1, finding that the ()-enantiomer tended to accumulate in zebrafish
   more easily than (+)-enantiomer. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD,
   CAT and GPx) and GSH content were all significantly decreased when
   zebrafish were exposed to 50 and 200 mu g L-1 HEX for 21 d. A series of
   genes of the apoptosis pathway were examined in groups treated with 50
   and 200 mu g L-1 HEX for 21 d using real-time PCR. Significant
   up-regulation of p53, Puma, Apaf-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression
   and down-regulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio were proved. The
   overall results indicated that waterborne HEX was able to produce
   oxidative stress and induce apoptosis through the involvement of
   caspases in adult zebrafish. The above information will play a vital
   role in the integrated environmental risk assessment of HEX and make its
   toxic mechanism in fish clear. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Recently, size-controlled pesticide microcapsule (MC) delivery systems
   have played an important role in precision farming development; however,
   the potential environmental hazards of MCs with different particle sizes
   have not been fully characterized. In this study, we prepared a series
   of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC)-MCs with nano and micron-scale capsule sizes
   (average diameters of 209.4 nm, MC-N; 2.41 mu m, MC-S; 4.87 mu m, MC-M;
   and 12.41 mu m, MC-L). The assessment results showed that the release
   and sedimentation behavior of LC-MCs in water and toxicity to zebrafish
   at three life stages were all particle size-dependent. As the diameter
   distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale
   (similar to 27 mu m), the capsules released more slowly and sunk more
   quickly in water. In addition, micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in
   significantly less fish mortality and malformations of larvae and
   embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The highest accumulation
   of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae suggested that
   the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would pose
   unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms. The obvious
   toxicological differences of LC-MCs toward aquatic organisms implies
   that regulating MC production in an appropriate size range is an
   important prerequisite for achieving efficient but safe pesticide
   applications.},

Title = {Triadimefon triggers circling behavior and conditioned place preference/
   aversion in zebrafish in a dose dependent manner},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Triadimefon (TDF) is a pesticide used in agricultural crops to control
   powdery mildews, rusts and other fungal pests. It exerts its fungicidal
   activity through the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, impairing
   the formation of the cell membrane. For vertebrates, one of its side
   effects is the binding to the dopamine transporter increasing the levels
   of synaptic dopamine, similarly to cocaine. In addition, it has been
   demonstrated that TDF affects the abundance of other monoamines in the
   brain, specifically serotonin. It is well known that drugs which alter
   the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems produce behavioral changes and
   participate in the development of addictions in mammals. In this work we
   have used the conditioned place preference paradigm to assess, for the
   first time, the rewarding properties of TDF in zebrafish. We found out
   that TDF triggers both, preference and aversion depending on the dosage
   used during conditioning. We observed that 5 mg/L produced aversion to
   the pattern previously paired with TDF. However, 15 mg/L induced the
   opposite behavior, showing that zebrafish seek out those environments
   which had previously been paired with the higher dose of TDF. These
   results are congruent with our previous findings, where we showed that 5
   mg/L reduced the levels of serotonin, usually linked to anxious
   behaviors (a negative cue), whereas higher concentrations of TDF
   increased extracellular dopamine, the main currency of the reward
   system. Interestingly, both doses of TDF induced circling behavior, a
   feature usually seen in glutamatergic antagonists.},

Abstract = {Hydrodynamics and pollution affect estuarine populations, but their
   ecological effects have rarely been studied in combination. We conducted
   two laboratory experiments to quantify whether predator-prey
   interactions between California killifish, Fundulus parvipinnis, and the
   polychaete Polydora cornuta vary with flow speed and chlorpyrifos
   exposure. In one experiment, only F. parvipinnis was exposed to
   chlorpyrifos; in the other, only P. cornuta was exposed. The flume
   included a 300-cm(2) area of sediment with 24P. cornuta in a central
   patch (98cm(2)). We videotaped groups of three killifish for 50min at
   one of four flow speeds (6, 9, 12, or 15cm/s) and recorded the
   proportion of bites directed at the prey patch. Unexposed killifish
   directed 70\% of their bites at the prey patch at 6cm/s, and prey-patch
   selection decreased as flow increased. Killifish exposed to chlorpyrifos
   directed 41\% of their bites at the prey patch at 6cm/s with reduced
   prey-patch selection relative to unexposed fish at 9 and 12cm/s. At
   15cm/s, both exposed and unexposed fish displayed non-selective biting.
   Worms were videotaped to quantify their deposit- and suspension-feeding
   activities. Exposing worms to chlorpyrifos reduced total feeding
   activity by similar to 30\%. Suspension feeding was more common at
   faster flow speeds, but the time worms spent suspension feeding relative
   to deposit feeding was unaffected by chlorpyrifos. No behavioral changes
   were noted in either species when the other was exposed to chlorpyrifos.
   This study highlights how hydrodynamic conditions can alter the relative
   importance of a toxicant's effects on predator-prey interactions.},

Abstract = {Considering the antioxidant properties of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and
   the involvement of oxidative stress events in paraquat-induced
   neurotoxicity, this study investigated the protective effect of dietary
   Na2SeO3 on biochemical and behavioral parameters of zebrafish exposed to
   paraquat (PQ). Fish were pretreated with a Na2SeO3 diet for 21 days and
   then PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six
   injections for 16 days. In the novel tank test, the Na2SeO3 diet
   prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the increase in the time
   spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of freezing
   episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced
   aggression (MIA) tasks, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in the latency to
   enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of
   PQ-treated animals, respectively. Na2SeO3 prevented the increase of
   carbonylated protein (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
   nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as the decrease in non-protein
   thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant enzymatic defenses,
   Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and glutathione
   peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary Na2SeO3
   improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment in
   zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety-
   and aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.},

Title = {Assessing sub-lethal effects of the dinitroaniline herbicide
   pendimethalin in zebrafish embryos/larvae (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Pendimethalin is a dinitroaniline herbicide used to control broadleaf
   weeds by inhibiting the formation of microtubules during cell division.
   Its use on a variety of crops leads to its potential entry into aquatic
   environments, but little is known about its sub-lethal toxicity to early
   developmental stages of aquatic vertebrates. To address this knowledge
   gap, we assessed the toxicity of pendimethalin to zebrafish embryos and
   larvae by measuring mortality, developmental abnormalities, oxidative
   respiration, reactive oxygen species, gene expression, and locomotor
   activity following exposure to the herbicide throughout early
   development. Embryos at similar to 6 h postfertilization (hpf) were
   exposed to either a solvent control (0.1\% DMSO, v/v), embryo rearing
   medium (ERM), or one dose of either 1, 2.5, 5, or 25 mu M pendimethalin
   for up to 7-days post fertilization depending on the bioassay. Exposure
   to 25 mu M pendimethalin resulted in high prevalence of spinal
   curvature, tail malformations, pericardial edema, and yolk sac edema at
   4 dpf, while exposure to 5 mu M pendimethalin induced pericardial edema
   and lordosis in the fish exposed over 7 dpf. Exposure to pendimethalin
   up to 5 mu M did not negatively impact oxidative respiration (e.g.,
   basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production) in embryos
   following a 24-h exposure. Pendimethalin did not induce reactive oxygen
   species at concentrations of 1-5 mu M. Levels of transcripts associated
   with oxidative respiration and damage response were altered in
   7d-larvae; cox1 mRNA was increased in larvae fish exposed to 1 mu M
   while cox5a1 and sod2 mRNA were decreased with 2.5 mu M exposure. The
   Visual Motor Response (VMR) test for light-dark response revealed that
   larval activity in the dark period was reduced for zebrafish exposed to
   >1 mu M pendimethalin compared to ERM and DMSO solvent control groups.
   These data inform on the sub-lethal toxicity of pendimethalin to early
   stages of fish embryos and larvae.},

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative
   disorder in the world. Apart from motor deficits, PD reduces patient's
   quality of life through sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment and
   emotional disorders. However, it's unclear whether bad life habits such
   as stay up late exacerbate the patient's cognition and emotional
   disorders. Thus we investigated the consequences of sleep deprivation
   (SD) on memory and emotions using a rotenone-based zebrafish model of
   PD. Behavioral assays, using locomotor activity assay, showed that
   rotenone treated zebrafish exhibited PD-like symptoms, whereas sleep
   deprivation didn't exacerbate the progression of them. The object
   discrimination task exhibited that the short-term cognitive deficits of
   rotenone group are more serious than the sham group after SD. Light-dark
   box test showed that rotenone treated fish are more dysphoric than the
   sham fish after SD. Dopamine and DOPAC significantly reduced in rotenone
   treated fish compared with the sham fish. However, this DOPAC reduction
   recovered after SD. The expression of D2 and D3 in rotenone treated
   zebrafish elevated compared with sham group and SD group. However, the
   rotenone treated zebrafish manifested a decrease level of D2 and D3
   after SD. Dl did not show any significantly changes among the four
   groups. Our findings suggest that zebrafish treated with rotenone may
   have a more severe damage of memory and emotional function after SD,
   which may be related to the changes in the DA systems.},

   Larvae (n = 16-24 per concentration) were exposed to each chemical
   (0.0001-120 mu M) during development and locomotor activity was
   assessed. Approximately half of the chemicals (n = 30) did not show any
   gross developmental toxicity (i.e., mortality, dysmorphology or
   non-hatching) at the highest concentration tested. Twelve of the 31
   chemicals that did elicit developmental toxicity were toxic at the
   highest concentration only, and thirteen chemicals were developmentally
   toxic at concentrations of 10 mu M or lower. Eleven chemicals caused
   behavioral effects; four chemicals (6-aminonicotinamide,
   cyclophosphamide, paraquat, phenobarbital) altered behavior in the
   absence of developmental toxicity. In addition to screening a library of
   chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity, we also compared our findings
   with previously published results for those chemicals. Our comparison
   revealed a general lack of standardized reporting of experimental
   details, and it also helped identify some chemicals that appear to be
   consistent positives and negatives across multiple laboratories.},

Title = {Improved antifungal activity and reduced aquatic toxicity of fludioxonil
   by complexation with beta-cyclodextrin},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {1246},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Poor water solubility results in limited fungicidal bioavailability and
   poses a great risk to non-target organisms due to the use of organic
   solvent in formulation processing. Here, the water solubility of
   fludioxonil (Flu) was improved by generating an inclusion complex with
   beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) at 1:1 host-guest stoichiometric ratio. The
   formation of the inclusion complex was confirmed by SEM, XRD, FT-IR,
   DSC, and H-1-NMR spectra. Molecular docking simulation found that Flu
   was imbedded into the beta-CD cavity, folded, and centrally aligned
   inside. In addition, Flu/beta-CD displayed increased soil mobility,
   sustained release behavior, and a 2.75-fold increase of the fungicidal
   activity against Botrytis cinerea. Importantly, the prepared inclusion
   complex exhibited decreased acute toxicity to phytoplankton (Chlorella
   vulgaris), zooplankton (Daphnia magna ), and fish (Danio rerio) than
   technical Flu. This study provided useful information for the rational
   use of Flu in agriculture, as well as the reduction of ecological risk
   to the aquatic environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Subchronic impacts of 2,4-D herbicide Weedestroy (R) AM40 on associative
   learning in juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens)},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control a wide variety of
   invasive and nuisance plants. One common active ingredient used in
   commercial herbicide formulations in Midwestern states is
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Due to the stability of 2,4-D in
   aquatic environments, many non-target aquatic species experience
   prolonged exposure throughout critical developmental life stages that
   can affect essential behaviors. However, the impacts of 2,4-D exposure
   on learning behaviors in juvenile fish are poorly understood. Therefore,
   we conducted a series of experiments using a maze environment to
   determine the effects of a commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide
   formulation (Weedestroy (R) AM40; WAM40; at 0.00, 0.50, 2.00, and 50.00
   mg/L 2,4-D acid equivalent (a.e.)) exposure on juvenile yellow perch's
   ability to perform a feed associated learning behavior. We observed a
   significant decrease in the ability of yellow perch to correctly
   complete the feed associated learning behavior within 200 s when exposed
   to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to controls (p =
   0.0002; p < 0.0001, respectively) and within 600 s when exposed to WAM40
   at 2.00 and 50.0 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to the controls (p = 0.0107 and
   p 0.0001). These data suggest that exposure to 2,4-D in WAM40 can both
   increase the amount of time it takes for yellow perch to complete a feed
   associated learning behavior and/or obstruct the behavior altogether.
   Further experiments showed no significant decreases in locomotion (p
   0.05), hunger motivation (p > 0.05), and a visually guided startle
   response (p > 0.05), in all treatment groups tested as compared to
   controls. This suggests that 2,4-D in WAM40 does not inhibit feed
   associated learning behaviors via interaction with these mechanisms.
   Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for
   weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to cognitive
   functions that control essential behaviors of yellow perch.},

Title = {Mitochondrial dysfunction-based cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity induced
   by pyraclostrobin in zebrafish larvae},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {251},
Pages = {203-211},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pyraclostrobin is widely used to control crop diseases, and was reported
   to be highly toxic to aquatic organisms. The molecular target of
   pyraclostrobin to fungus is the mitochondrion, but its effect on
   mitochondria of aquatic organisms has rarely been investigated. In this
   study, zebrafish larvae at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) were exposed
   to a range of pyraclostrobin for 96 h to assess its acute toxicity and
   effects on mitochondria. Pyraclostrobin at 36 mu g/L or higher
   concentrations caused significant influences on larval heart and brain
   including pericardial edema, brain damage malformations, histological
   and mitochondrial structural damage of the two organs. The results of
   RNA-Seq revealed that the transcripts of genes related to oxidative
   phosphorylation, cardiac muscle contraction, mitochondrion, nervous
   system development and glutamate receptor activity were significantly
   influenced by 36 mu g/L pyraclostrobin. Further tests showed that
   pyraclostrobin at 18 and 36 mu g/L. reduced the concentrations of
   proteins related to cardiac muscle contraction, impaired cardiac
   function, inhibited glutamate receptors activities and suppressed
   locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. Negative changes in
   mitochondria( complex activities, as well as reduced ATP content were
   also observed in larvae treated with 18 and 36 mu g/L pyraclostrobin.
   These results suggested that pyraclostrobin exposure caused
   cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae and mitochondrial
   dysfunction might be the underlying mechanism of pyraclostrobin
   toxicity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Atrazine (ATZ), the second most commonly used herbicide in the United

   common drinking water contaminant. This study further investigates
   ATZ-related developmental toxicity by testing the following hypotheses
   in zebrafish: the effects of embryonic ATZ exposure are dependent on
   timing of exposure; embryonic ATZ exposure alters brain development and
   function; and embryonic ATZ exposure changes protein abundance in
   carcinogenesis-related pathways. After exposing embryos to 0, 0.3, 3, or
   30 parts per billion (ppb) ATZ, we monitored the expression of
   cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (cypl7a1), glyoxalase I

   normal dynamic expression, but ttc3 and tpd52l1 had ATZ-related
   expression changes before 72 h. Larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had
   increased brain length, while larvae exposed to 30 ppb ATZ were
   hypoactive. Proteomic analysis identified altered protein abundance in
   pathways related to cellular function, neurodevelopment, and
   genital-tract cancer. The results indicate embryonic ATZ toxicity

Title = {Evaluating the Effects of Forestry Herbicides on Fish Development Using
   Rapid Phenotypic Screens},
Journal = {NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {975-984},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Herbicides are used to control invasive or noxious plants on public
   lands throughout the western United States. These chemicals are often
   applied in the upper reaches of watersheds that provide spawning and
   rearing habitat for anadromous species of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus
   spp., steelhead O. mykiss, and bull trout Salvelinus confluentus. As a
   consequence, natural resource managers must often weigh the ecological
   benefits of using herbicides to control nonnative plants against the
   potential for unintended toxicological impacts on salmonids,
   particularly during early life stages. However, the effects of chemical
   control agents on fish development have not been widely investigated.
   Their use in the vicinity of aquatic habitats, including areas that
   support threatened and endangered species, is therefore a concern. To
   address this uncertainty, we used the zebrafish Dania rerio as a model
   experimental system for investigating developmental toxicity, which
   involved conducting rapid and sensitive phenotypic screens for potential
   developmental defects resulting from exposure to six herbicides
   (picloram, clopyralid, imazapic, glyphosate, imazapyr, and triclopyr)
   and several technical formulations (Tordon K, Transline, Habitat,
   Plateau, Garlon 3A, and Renovate). Zebrafish embryos were exposed
   continuously through 5 d of development at nominal concentrations
   ranging from 3 mu g/L to 10 mg/L. Detailed screens were used to examine
   aspects of ontogeny from early development (gastrulation and
   segmentation) through organogenesis, hatching, and morphology as
   free-swimming larvae. Growth was measured at the end of each exposure
   interval. To detect defects in neural development (sensorimotor
   integration), the escape reflex of larvae was monitored at 3, 4, and 5 d
   after fertilization. No developmental toxicity was observed in response
   to the six individual herbicides or the different technical
   formulations. The absence of toxicity at relatively high exposure
   concentrations suggests that noxious weed control activities are not
   likely to pose a direct threat to the health of salmonids at early life
   stages.},

Abstract = {This study describes a long-term toxicity test within a period of 2
   months using zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) as the test species and
   concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mug/l DDT as a model substance. By
   collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate
   mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously.
   Sperm is released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface,
   subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water
   for several minutes. Sperm trails consists of bands of viscous material
   in which sperm is embedded. The water samples for the estimation of
   sperm presence were collected gradually within 180 min after 24 hr, 2
   weeks, 1 month and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the
   reduction in count, activity of sperm and the average life span of sperm
   trails were significant (p < 0.05) at the tested concentrations 5 mug/l
   and 50 mug/l DDT after 1 month of exposure. In conclusion, this study
   demonstrates that long exposure time and higher DDT tested levels
   accelerate the occurrence of negative effect on the number and activity
   of sperm released as well as the life span of their trails.},

Abstract = {Chemicals considered as neuroactive (such as certain pesticides,

   of bioactive substances recently detected in European rivers. However,
   the determination of nervous-system-specific effects has been limited
   using in vitro tests or conventional end points including lethality.
   Thus, neurobehavioral tests using in vivo models (e.g., zebrafish
   embryo) have been proposed as complementary approaches. To investigate
   the specificity and sensitivity of a light-dark transition locomotor
   response (LMR) test in 4 to 5 days post fertilization zebrafish with
   respect to different modes of action (MoAs), we analyzed a set of 18
   environmentally relevant compounds with various anticipated MoAs. We
   found that exposure-induced behavioral alterations were reproducible and
   dependent on concentration and time. Comparative and quantitative
   analyses of the obtained locomotor patterns revealed that behavioral
   effects were not restricted to compounds primarily known to target the
   nervous system. A clear distinction of MoAs based on locomotor patterns
   was not possible for most compounds. Furthermore, chemicals with an
   anticipated same MoA did not necessarily provoke similar behavioral
   phenotypes. Finally, we determined an increased sensitivity (>= 10-fold)
   compared to observed mortality in the LMR assay for five of eight
   neuroactive chemicals as opposed to non-neuroactive compounds.},

Title = {Sub-lethal toxicity assessment of the phenylurea herbicide linuron in
   developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo/larvae},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {81},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Due to run-off and rain events, agrochemicals can enter water
   catchments, exerting endocrine disruption effects and toxicity to
   aquatic organisms. Linuron is a phenylurea herbicide used to control a
   wide variety of vegetative weeds in agriculture in addition to
   residential applications. However, there are few studies that quantify
   its toxicity to early developmental stages of fish. The objectives of
   this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to zebrafish
   embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities,
   oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the
   Visual Motor Response test. Zebrafish embryos at similar to 6-h
   post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either embryo rearing medium
   (ERM), or one dose of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mu M linuron for up to
   7 days post-fertilization (dpf) depending on the assay. Zebrafish larvae
   exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and
   spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using the
   Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal
   respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf
   embryos at 20 mu M after a 24-hour exposure. In 7 dpf larvae, transcript
   abundance was determined for 6 transcripts that have a role in oxidative
   respiration (atp06, cox1, cox4-1, cox5a1, cytb, and nd1); the relative
   abundance of these transcripts was not altered with linuron treatment. A
   Visual Motor Response test was conducted on 7 dpf larvae to determine
   whether linuron (0.625 to 5 mu M) impaired locomotor activity. Larval
   activity in the dark period decreased in a dose dependent manner and
   there were indications of hypoactivity as low as 1.25 mu M. Transcript
   abundance was thus determined for tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) and
   glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad1b), two rate limiting enzymes that
   control the production of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid
   respectively. The mRNA levels of gad1b = 0.019) were reduced with
   increasing concentrations of linuron while th1 (p = 0.056) showed a
   similar decreasing trend, suggesting that neurotransmitter biosynthesis
   may be altered with exposure to linuron. This study improves knowledge
   related to the toxicity mechanisms for linuron and is the first to
   demonstrate that this anti-androgenic chemical impairs oxidative
   respiration and exerts neurotoxic effects associated with
   neurotransmitter biosynthesis during early development. These data are
   significant for environmental risk assessment of agrochemicals.},

Title = {Low-dose cadmium stress increases the bioaccumulation and toxicity of
   dinotefuran enantiomers in zebrafish (Danio rerio)?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {269},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Co-occurrence of pesticides and heavy metals has attracted extensive
   attention. The enantioselective behaviors of dinotefuran to aquatic
   organisms have not been reported, and the effects of cadmium (Cd) was
   absent, which were investigated in this study at environmentally
   relevant concentrations. The enantioselective accumulation and
   elimination of dinotefuran enantiomers were observed in zebrafish, and
   it had tissue specificity. The S-dinotefuran concentrations were higher
   than R-dinotefuran in heads and viscera, but it was opposite in muscles.
   There existed competition between S-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran, and
   the existence of S-dinotefuran might decrease the accumulation and
   elimination of the R-dinotefuran in zebrafish. When co-exposure to Cd
   and dinotefuran, the accumulation concentrations of dinotefuran
   enantiomers increased in zebrafish at the initial stage, which were
   opposite latterly. The accumulation concentrations of R-dinotefuran in R
   + Cd treatment in fish were 3.4 times higher than those in R-dinotefuran
   treatment, and the enantiomer fraction (EF) values changed from 0.484 to
   0.195. The oxidative stress of S-dinotefuran on zebrafish was highest,
   followed by rac- and R-dinotefuran. Coexposure to Cd led to toxicity
   increase for R-dinotefuran, the malonaldehyde (MDA) content decreased
   significantly in R + Cd treatment during 7-28 days, while obvious
   declination of MDA contents was found on the 28th day in R-dinotefuran
   treatment. Furthermore, compared to R-dinotefuran treatment, Cd
   increased the relative expression of cz-sod (3.4 times), cas3 (1.6
   times) and p53 (5.7 times) in R + Cd treatment. The co-exposure of Cd
   might alter the environmental behaviors and toxicity effects of
   dinotefuran enantiomers in zebrafish, including the enantioselectivity.
   The effects of Cd on accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran were
   greater than those on S-dinotefuran. Thus, it is necessary to consider
   the effects of coexistent metals to chiral pesticides in ecological
   risk.
   Summarizes: The enantioselective accumulation and elimination of
   dinotefuran enantiomers had tissue specificity. Cd increased the
   accumulation and toxicity of R-dinotefuran in zebrafish. (C) 2020

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Abstract = {Carbendazim, a common pesticide, has shown signs of causing cancer,
   infertility and toxicity to organisms. Due to its intense use, this
   fungicide has become a persistent compound in the environment, raising
   the importance of better understanding its behaviour, metabolic pathways
   and effects on organisms. Zebrafish is considered an excellent animal
   model, being able to rapidly absorb compounds in water, mimicking what
   occurs in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the aim of this work was
   to evaluate carbendazim metabolites in zebrafish water tank using liquid

   stability groups were defined. In addition, water samples were collected
   from the tanks and analyses were carried out by LC-HRMS. The results
   allowed the putative annotation of 7 target metabolites. This study
   applied the analysis of zebrafish water tank for evaluation of target
   metabolites of carbendazim as a promising approach, since it is a much
   cleaner matrix than the usual biological matrices. These metabolites can
   ensure detectability and further strengthen confidence in monitoring
   carbendazim exposure in aquatic environments. To the best of our
   knowledge, there is no one study that has evaluated carbendazim
   metabolites produced by zebrafish, neither in the animal's body nor in
   the water tank. This is the first report on the generation of
   carbendazim metabolites by zebrafish.},

Title = {Exposure to acetochlor impairs swim bladder formation, induces heat
   shock protein expression, and promotes locomotor activity in zebrafish
   (Danio rerio) larvae},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC 25},
Abstract = {Acetochlor is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world,
   however, there are few data on the sub-lethal effects of acetochlor on
   early developmental stages of fish. To address this, we measured
   survival, deformity, swim bladder formation, embryo oxygen consumption
   rates, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, transcripts (related to
   swim bladder formation, oxidative damage response, and apoptosis) and
   behavior responses following exposure to acetochlor (0.001 mu M up to
   125 mu M). Exposure to acetochlor at concentrations 50 mu M and above
   exerted 100\% mortality after 3 dpf, and significantly reduced the size
   of the swim bladder (25 mu M). In embryos, basal respiration,
   oligomycin-induced ATP production, and maximal respiration were
   decreased 30-60\% following a 24 h exposure to 125 mu M acetochlor.
   Acetochlor did not affect ROS levels up to 25 mu M in larvae with acute
   exposure. Acetochlor at 25 mu M increased mRNA levels of bax1, hsp70,
   and hsp90a by similar to 4-fold in larval zebrafish. In both the visual
   motor response and light-dark preference test, 25 mu M acetochlor
   increased locomotor activity of larval fish. At lower exposure
   concentrations, 100 and 1000 nM acetochlor increased the mean time spent
   in the dark zone, suggesting promotion of anxiolytic behavior. This
   study presents a comprehensive evaluation of sublethal effects of
   acetochlor, spanning molecular responses to behavior, which can be used
   to refine risk assessment decisions for aquatic environments.},

Title = {Acute toxicity of broflanilide on neurosecretory system and locomotory
   behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {305},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Broflanilide, a novel meta-diamide insecticide, possesses moderate acute
   toxicity to zebrafish, with a 96-h median lethal concentration (96-LC50)
   of 0.76 mg/L. However, its effect on fish behavior and the underlying
   mechanisms are still unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of
   broflanilide on the zebrafish brain over a 96-h exposure by comparing
   the histopathological changes and relative expression of targeted genes
   with the behavioral metrics. The results of the toxicity test showed
   that broflanilide could cause deformities, such as deformation of the
   operculum and spinal curvature, at 0.6, 0.82 and 1.15 mg/L. Results also
   showed tissue damage and apoptosis in the cerebellum under 0.27 and 0.6
   mg/L exposure. Additionally, broflanilide affected the
   neurotransmitters, metabolites and transcripts of genes associated with
   dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid expression. and the signaling pathways
   in zebrafish brains at 0.60 mg/L after 1 h and 96 h of exposure, while
   the levels of glutamate, glutamate decarboxylase, GABA transaminase,
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate
   (ATP) were also inhibited at 0.27 mg/L after 96 h of exposure. The
   accumulated swimming distance was significantly longer and the average
   speed was significantly faster than the control at 0.27 and 0.6 mg/L
   after 1-h of exposure, while these metrics were lowered at 0.6 mg/L
   after 96 h of exposure. The study results demonstrates that broflanilide
   affects the zebrafish brain, neurotransmitters and associated fish
   behaviors. This study also provides deeper insight into the mechanistic
   understanding of the effects of broflanilide on the zebrafish brain.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder with motor
   and nonmotor signs. The current therapeutic regimen for PD is mainly
   symptomatic as the etio-pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. A
   variety of animal models has been generated to study different aspects
   of the disease for understanding the pathogenesis and therapeutic
   development. The disease model can be generated through neurotoxin-based
   or genetic-based approaches in a wide range of animals such as non-human
   primates (NHP), rodents, zebrafish, Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans, and
   drosophila. Cellular-based disease model is frequently used because of
   the ease of manipulation and suitability for large-screen assays. In
   neurotoxin-induced models, chemicals such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA),
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and
   paraquat are used to recapitulate the disease. Genetic manipulation of
   PD-related genes, such as alpha-Synuclein(SNCA), Leucine-rich repeat
   kinase 2 (LRRK2), Pten-Induced Kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin(PRKN), and
   Protein deglycase (DJ-1) Are used in the transgenic models. An emerging
   model that combines both genetic- and neurotoxin-based methods has been
   generated to study the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of
   PD. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different PD
   models and their utility for different research purposes.},

Title = {An embryonic atrazine exposure results in reproductive dysfunction in
   adult zebrafish and morphological alterations in their offspring},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {The herbicide atrazine, a suspected endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC),
   frequently contaminates potable water supplies. Studies suggest
   alterations in the neuroendocrine system along the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis; however, most studies address
   either developmental, pubertal, or adulthood exposures, with few
   investigations regarding a developmental origins hypothesis. In this
   study, zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion
   (ppb) atrazine through embryogenesis and then allowed to mature with no
   additional chemical exposure. Reproductive function, histopathology,
   hormone levels, offspring morphology, and the ovarian transcriptome were
   assessed. Embryonic atrazine exposure resulted in a significant increase
   in progesterone levels in the 3 and 30 ppb groups. A significant
   decrease in spawning and a significant increase in follicular atresia in
   the 30 ppb group were observed. In offspring, a decrease in the head
   length to body ratio in the 30 ppb group, along with a significant
   increase in head width to body ratio in the 0.3 and 3 ppb groups
   occurred. Transcriptomic alterations involved genes associated with
   endocrine system development and function, tissue development, and
   behavior. This study provides evidence to support atrazine as an EDC
   causing reproductive dysfunction and molecular alterations in adults
   exposed only during embryogenesis and morphological alterations in their
   offspring.},

Title = {The role of nanoplastics on the toxicity of the herbicide phenmedipham,
   using Danio rerio embryos as model organisms},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {303},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Once in the aquatic ecosystems, nanoplastics (NPls) can interact with
   other contaminants acting as vectors of transport and altering their
   toxicological effects towards organisms. Thus, the present study aims to
   investigate how polystyrene NPls (44 nm) interact with the herbicide
   phenmedipham (PHE) and affect its toxicity to zebrafish embryos. Single
   exposures to 0, 0.015, 0.15, 1.5, 15 and 150 mg/L NPls and 0.02, 0.2, 2
   and 20 mg/L PHE were performed. Embryos were also exposed to the
   binominal combinations: 0.015 mg/L NPls + 2 mg/L PHE, 0.015 mg/L NPls +
   20 mg/L PHE, 1.5 mg/L NPls + 2 mg/L PHE and 1.5 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE.
   Due to the low solubility of PHE in water, a solvent control was
   performed (0.01\% acetone). PHE was quantified. Mortality, heartbeat and
   hatching rate, malformations appearance, locomotor behavior and
   biomarkers related to oxidative stress, neurotransmission and energy
   budgets were analyzed. During 96 h, NPls and PHE single and combined
   exposures did not affect embryos development. After 120 h, NPls induced
   hyperactivity and PHE induced hypoactivity. After 96 h, NPls increased
   catalase activity and PHE increased glutathione S-transferases activity.
   On the combination 0.015 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE, hyperactivity behavior
   was found, similar to 0.015 mg/L NPls, and cholinesterase activity was
   inhibited. Additionally, the combination 1.5 mg/L NPls + 20 mg/L PHE
   increased both catalase and glutathione S-transferases activities. The
   combination NPls with PHE affected more biochemical endpoints than the
   single exposures, showing the higher effect of the binominal
   combinations. Dissimilar interactions effects - no interaction,
   synergism and antagonism - between NPls and PHE were found. The current
   study shows that the effects of NPls on bioavailability and toxicity of
   other contaminants (e.g. PHE) cannot be ignored during the assessment of
   NPls environmental behavior and risks.},

Abstract = {Pesticides are a major cause of the reduction in the global amphibian
   population. In this study, the acute toxicity and chronic effects of
   metamifop on Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) tadpoles were investigated. The
   96 h-LC50 value of metamifop on X. laevis tadpoles was 0.634 mg/L, which
   indicated that metamifop was highly toxic to tadpoles. In the chronic
   toxicity study, tadpoles were exposed to 0.063 mg/L of metamifop. After
   14, 21 and 35 d of exposure, metamifop significantly inhibited the body
   weight and neurotransmitter synthesis of tadpoles, caused abnormal
   behavior and interfered with fat metabolism. According to the results of
   antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde (MDA), tadpoles exposed to 0.063
   mg/L metamifop suffered severe lipid oxidative damage. Compared with the
   control group, the thyroid hormone (TH) levels and related gene
   expression in tadpoles in the treatment group were affected, reflecting
   the endocrine interference effect of metamifop. The data of this study
   can enrich our knowledge of the effects of aryloxyphenoxy propionate
   pesticides on amphibians and highlight the role of metamifop and other
   pesticides play in global decline of amphibians.},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of sub-lethal
   doses of Cypermethrin (CYP) on the survival and morphological and
   biochemical aspects of rohu (Labeo rohita) during early developmental
   stages. Newly fertilized eggs were incubated in the presence of
   sub-lethal concentration of CYP (20\% of LC50 i.e., 8.43 mu g L-1) in a
   well designed flow through system. Increased mortality was found with
   increase in exposure time. Deformities like eroded yolk and margins,
   elongated yolk sac, larvae with short tail, no eyes or larvae with
   zigzag movement and paralyzed larvae were observed in CYP treated group
   from blastula to fry stage. The activities of antioxidant like Catalase
   (CAT), Peroxidase (POD) and Lactoperoxidase (LPO) were decreased from 24
   to 96 h in the control group whereas increased in CYP treated group. The
   Glutathione reducatse (GR) activity was also increased with time in both
   the control and treated groups; however, the activity was significantly
   higher in CYP treated group. Similarly, the whole body cortisol level
   showed an increasing trend with time in both control and treated groups.
   However, in CYP exposed group the cortisol level was considerably higher
   after 24 h exposure but statistically comparable to the control group
   after 96 h. It can be concluded from the present results that CYP even
   at very low concentration adversely affects the early development of L.
   rohita and enhances mortality. The obtained results reveal that CYP may
   affect the wild population of fish by inducing oxidative stress and
   modulating stress response during early ontogenesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Dietary contaminants are often an over-looked factor in the health of

   filtration systems to purify incoming water to ensure that contaminants,

   However, diets are rarely tested for contaminants and, in the case of
   manufactured zebrafish feeds, since the product is marketed for
   aquaculture or aquarium use it is assumed that the feed is acceptable
   for animals used for research. The following provides examples as to how

   to GLY (5 and 15 mg/L) for 30 days induced liver inflammation and
   oxidative damage in common carp and changed the physical barrier of the

   and immune system responses to GLY. Moreover, an inhibitory effect of 15
   mg/L GLY on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was found in the brain,
   which may be an important reason for the significant decrease in both
   swimming distance and average acceleration of common carp. Cell
   experiments showed that 0.65 and 3.25 mg/L GLY inhibited the viability
   of EPCs. Furthermore, oxidative DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction,

Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {BackgroundOrganophosphate pesticides-OP-, like malathion, can alter the
   normal functioning of neuro-endocrine systems (e.g.,
   hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid-HPT- axis), and to interfere on the
   thyroidal homeostasis. Through direct interactions with thyroid
   receptors, an/or indirectly via up-stream signalling pathways, from the
   HPT axis (i.e., negative feedback regulation), malathion possess the
   ability to affect integrity of thyroidal follicular tissue, and it can
   also block or delay its hormonal functioning. This insecticide can alter
   the majority of the ontogenetic processes, inducing several deformities,
   and also provoking decreases in the growth and survival patterns. The
   present study has been performed to determine the sublethal effects of
   malathion during the first month of life of the Senegalese sole, Solea
   senegalensis, and it is mainly focused on the metamorphosis phase.
   Different transcript expression levels (i.e. thyroid receptors, matrix
   and bone -Gla-proteins) and immunohistochemical patterns (i.e. thyroid
   hormones, osteocalcin, cell proliferation) have been analysed during the
   most critical phases of the flatfish metamorphosis, that is, through
   differentiation of thyroid system and skeletal development, migration of
   the eye, and further adaptation to benthic behaviours.ResultsIn early
   life stages of the Senegalese sole, the exposure to the highest
   concentration of malathion (6.25g/L) affected to the growth patterns,
   showing the exposed individuals, a reduction around 60 and 92\% of the
   total length and the dry weigth, respectively. In paralell, a
   significant reduction of the thyroid follicles (i.e., size and number)
   it was also been recorded, in a dose-dependent way. Abnormal phenotypes
   induced in the exposed larvae, did not complete the process of
   metamorphosis, and displayed several morphological abnormalities and
   developmental disorders, which were mainly associated with the eye
   migration process, and with thyroidal and skeletal disorders (i.e.,
   transcriptional and protein changes of thyroid hormones and receptors,
   and of matrix and bone Gla proteins distribution), that conduced to an
   inadequate adaptation to the benthic life.ConclusionsIn the Senegalese
   sole, the majority of the ontogenetic alterations induced by the
   exposure to malathion were mainly associated to the metamorphosis
   period, which is a thyroid-driven proccess. In fact, most crucial and
   transitional ontogenic events, appeared notably disturbed, for e.g.,
   thyroid gland differentiation and functioning, migration of eye,
   skeletal development and benthonic behaviors.},

Abstract = {The pesticide mancozeb (mz) is recognized as a potent inducer of
   oxidative stress due to its ability to catalyze the production of
   reactive oxygen species plus inhibiting mitochondrial respiration thus
   becoming an environmental risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite
   numerous toxicological studies on mz have been directed to mammals,
   attention on marine fish is still lacking. Thus, it was our intention to
   evaluate neurobehavioral activities of ornate wrasses (Thalassoma pavo)
   exposed to 0.2 mg/I of mz after a preliminary screening test (0.07-0.3
   mg/I). Treated fish exhibited an evident (p < 0.001) latency to reach
   T-maze arms (> 1000\%) while exploratory attitudes (total arm entries)
   diminished ( 50\%; p < 0.05) versus controls during spontaneous
   exploration tests. Moreover, they showed evident enhancements (+ 111\%)
   of immobility in the cylinder test. Contextually, strong (-88\%; p <
   0.01) reductions of permanence in light zone of the Light/Dark apparatus
   along with diminished crossings (-65\%) were also detected. Conversely,
   wrasses displayed evident enhancements (160\%) of risk assessment
   consisting of fast entries in the dark side of this apparatus. From a
   molecular point of view, a notable activation (p < 0.005) of the brain
   transcription factor pCREB occurred during mz-exposure. Similarly, in
   situ hybridization supplied increased HSP90 mRNAs in most brain areas
   such as the lateral part of the dorsal telencephalon (DI; + 68\%) and
   valvula of the cerebellum (VCe; +35\%) that also revealed evident
   argyrophilic signals. Overall, these first indications suggest a
   possible protective role of the early biomarkers pCREB and HSP90 against
   fish toxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Trifloxystrobin (TFS) is the widely used strobilurin fungicide. However,
   little information is so far available regarding the uptake kinetics and
   developmental toxicity of TFS to fish. The present study was conducted
   to investigate the uptake kinetics, potential environment risk and
   toxicity of TFS on Gobiocypris rarus embryos. Results revealed that
   increased malformation, decreased body length and heart rate, affected
   spontaneous movement and swimming speed provide a gradual
   concentration-dependent manner; values of 144 h LC50 (median lethal
   concentration) and EC50 (median effective concentration) were 1.11 and
   0.86 mu g L-1. Continuous exposure to TFS resulted in a steady
   accumulation with no evidence of elimination. Enzyme activities were
   significantly changed; reactive oxygen species and DNA damage were
   significantly induced after TFS treatment. Certain genes related to cell
   apoptosis (p53), metabolism (cyp1a), stress response (hsp70) and blood
   vessels (vezf1) development were all significantly up-regulated. This is
   the first study to define uptake kinetics and to focus on behavioral
   consequences, physiological changes and mRNA expression following TFS
   exposure in the early life stages of fish. Our results suggest that TFS
   is highly toxic to fish embryos. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The extensively studied cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is
   involved in the regulation of critical cell processes, including
   metabolism, gene expression, and cell proliferation. Therefore, PKA has
   been viewed increasingly as potential target for variety of drugs and
   environmental endocrine disruptors. Consequentially, the preparation of
   PKA protein became an important initial step for the subsequent
   exploration of PKA's character in endocrine disrupting effects of
   pesticides. To investigate PKA protein, which is potential to be the
   environmental endocrine toxicity target of triazole fungicides, a
   strategy to heterologously express protein kinase A catalytic alpha
   subunit of human (hPKAc alpha) and zebrafish (zPKAc alpha) in
   Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21(DE3) host cells was demonstrated. After
   optimizing conditions and protein purification, we successfully obtained
   enzymatically active hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha. Western blot analysis
   indicated that the recombinant hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha still
   retained their characteristic antigenicity and binding activity, while
   in vitro kinase activity assays revealed that the recombinant hPKAc
   alpha and zPKAc alpha maintained enzyme activity. By in silico methods
   including homology modelling and molecular docking, the affinity of
   ligands and the models of hPKAc alpha and zPKAc alpha were further
   tested. The present study offered a valuable method to achieve the
   prokaryotic expression of a eukaryotic protein kinase and laid a
   foundation to facilitate further investigation of toxicological target
   of triazole pesticides.},

Abstract = {By considering chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphorus pesticide with
   known mechanisms of action that affect neurobehavioral development, we
   assessed the validity and sensitivity of a miniaturized swim flume by
   investigating the effects of the insecticide on swimming behavior in
   medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish growing stages. Medaka in three
   developmental periods, namely 0, 20 and 40 day-old post-hatch (i.e. time
   points 0, 20 and 40, respectively), were exposed to CPF (12.5, 25, 50
   and 100 mu g/L) for 48 h under semi-static conditions. The CPF
   half-lives during exposures were evaluated and the swimming patterns in
   a flume section (arena) were presented on two-dimensional gradient maps
   of forced movement of fish against water current. A comparative
   numerical analysis of fish residence times between each time point
   control and the corresponding CPF groups was performed by dividing
   arenas into 15 proportional areas. The time point 0 control group
   gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of
   the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the
   differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas. The
   control group gradient maps for time points 20 and 40 differed from
   those of the respective >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups. The comparative
   analysis of the residence times in the corresponding 15 areas revealed
   differences in >= 5 areas for time point 20 and in >= 3 areas for time
   point 40. The integrative analysis of the gradient maps and the
   numerical statistics revealed stage-specific effects and a
   concentration-response relationship between CPF and alterations on
   forced medaka swimming despite the dissipation of CPF from the water
   column. These results indicate the validity of the miniaturized swim
   flume toward a more environmentally realistic scenario for the
   evaluation of neurodevelopmental and behavioral toxicity in small fish
   models.},

Abstract = {Organophosphorus compounds are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used as
   pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents. Acute organophosphorus
   poisoning (acute OPP) affects 3 million people, with 300 000 deaths
   annually worldwide. Severe acute OPP effects include overstimulation of
   cholinergic neurons, seizures, status epilepticus, and finally, brain
   damage. In a previous study, we developed 3 different chemical models of
   acute OPP in zebrafish larvae. To elucidate the complex
   pathophysiological pathways related to acute OPP, we used integrative
   omics (proteomic, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) on these 3 animal
   models. Our results show that these stochastic, apparently disparate
   morphological phenotypes can result from almost linear
   concentration-response variations in molecular levels. Results from the
   multiomics analysis strongly suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress
   might play a central role in the pathophysiology of severe acute OPP,
   emphasizing the urgent need of further research on this molecular
   pathway. Endoplasmic reticulum stress could be an important therapeutic
   target to be included in the treatment of patients with severe acute

Abstract = {As alternatives of brominated flame retardants, organophosphate flame
   retardants (OPFRs) can be detected in multiple marine environmental
   media. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) was one of the most
   frequently and abundantly detected OPFRs in the Bohai Sea. Exposure to
   TCPP has been shown to induce abnormal behavior in zebrafish as well as
   neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, there is a lack of
   mechanism investigations on the toxic effects of TCPP at molecular
   levels. In this work, proteomics and metabolomics were integrated to
   analyze the proteome and metabolome responses in rockfish Sebastes
   schlegeli treated with TCPP (10 and 100 nM) for 15 days. A total of 143
   proteins and 8 metabolites were significantly altered in rockfish
   following TCPP treatments. The responsive proteins and metabolites were
   predominantly involved in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, signal
   transduction, cellular transport, cholesterol metabolism, bile acid
   synthesis, and detoxification. Furthermore, a hypothesized network of
   proteins, metabolites, and pathways in rockfish was summarized based on
   the combination of proteomic and metabolomic results, showing some key
   molecular events in response to TCPP. Overall, the present study
   unraveled the molecular responses at protein and metabolite levels,
   which provided a better understanding of toxicological effects and
   mechanisms of TCPP in marine teleost.<bold> </bold>},

   triadimefon and its enantiomers},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {554-563},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Triadimefon (TF) is a widely used chiral fungicide with one chiral
   centre and two enantiomers (TF1 and TF2). However, little is reported
   about the ecological toxicity of reptiles on an enantioselective level.
   TF is a potential endocrine disruptor that may interfere with sex
   steroid hormones, such as testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E-2).
   In our study, the lizards Mongolia Racerunner (Eremias argus) were
   orally exposed to TF and its enantiomers for 21 days. Plasma sex steroid
   hormones and steroidogenic-related genes, including
   17-beta-hydroxysteroid (hsd17 beta), cytochrome P450 enzymes (cyp19 and
   cyp17), and steroid hormone receptors (era and Ar) were evaluated. After
   exposure, the plasma testosterone level in the 100 mg/kg(bw) group was
   elevated, while the oestradiol level was reduced. This phenomenon may be
   caused by the transformation of cyp19, which may inhibit the conversion
   of testosterone to oestradiol and affect sexual behaviour. In addition,
   the two enantiomers have different effects on hormone levels, which
   testified to the previously reported biotoxic dissimilarity between TF1
   and TF2 in organisms. Furthermore, the cyp19 mRNA level in liver and
   gonad of the TF2 and TF group (100 mg/kg(bw) were significantly
   down-regulated, while the cyp17 and hsd17 beta mRNA levels were
   up-regulated. The expression of era and Ar mRNA levels were up-regulated
   in males but not in females, which may indicate that TF has sex
   differences on these two genes. As seen from the above results, TF and
   its enantiomers may have endocrine-disrupting effects on lizards (E.
   argus) by acting sensitively on sex steroid hormones and
   steroidogenic-related genes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To screen the tens of thousands of chemicals for which no toxicity data
   currently exists, it is necessary to move from in vivo rodent models to
   alternative models, such as zebrafish. Here, we used dechorionated
   Tropical 5D wild-type zebrafish embryos to screen a 91-compound library
   provided by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for developmental
   toxicity. This library contained 86 unique chemicals that included
   negative controls, flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), drugs, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Fish were exposed
   to 5 concentrations of each chemical or an equal amount of vehicle
   (0.5\% DMSO) in embryo medium from 6h post-fertilization (hpf) to 5 days
   post-fertilization (dpf). Fish were examined daily for mortality and
   teratogenic effects and photomotor behavior was assessed at 4 and 5 dpf.
   Of the 5 negative control compounds in the library, none caused
   mortality/teratogenesis, but two altered behavior. Chemicals provided in
   duplicate produced similar outcomes. Overall, 13 compounds caused
   mortality/teratology but not behavioral abnormalities, 24 only affected
   behavior, and 18 altered both endpoints, with behavior affected at
   concentrations that did not cause mortality/teratology (55/86 hits). Of
   the compounds that affected behavior, 52\% caused behavioral
   abnormalities at either 4 or 5 dpf. Compounds within the same functional
   group caused different behavioral abnormalities, while similar
   behavioral patterns were caused by compounds from different groups. Our
   data suggest that behavior is a sensitive endpoint for developmental
   toxicity screening that integrates multiple modes of toxic action and is
   influenced by the age of the larval fish at the time of testing.},

Title = {Strategies of cellular energy allocation to cope with paraquat-induced
   oxidative stress: Chironomids vs Planarians and the importance of using
   different species},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {741},

Abstract = {Paraquat (PQ) is still used in several countries worldwide as an
   herbicide for weed control in agricultural production, ponds, reservoirs
   and irrigation canals. Thus, PQ is frequently found in surface water
   systems and is potentially toxic to aquatic organisms, since it can
   cause mitochondrial dysfunction altering in the redox state of cells.
   This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of PQ to Chironomus
   riparius and Girardia tigrina, and compare their physiological
   strategies to cope with environmental stress. The mean emergence time
   was the most sensitive endpoint for Chironomids, with the lowest
   observed effect concentrations (LOEC) being 0.02 for males and 0.1 mg PQ
   L-1 for females. Moreover, PQ reduced the body weight of male and female
   imagoes, with LOECs of 0.5 and 2.5 mg PQ L-1, respectively. Paraquat
   also decreased the respiration rate (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) and total
   glutathione (tGSH) content (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1). Thus, the aerobic
   production of energy was not affected and allowed chironomids to cope
   with oxidative stress induced by PQ, but with consequent physiological
   costs in terms of development rates and weight of adults. In planarians,
   PQ decreased the locomotion and feeding activity, and delayed
   photoreceptor regeneration (LOECs = 2.5 mg PQ L-1 for all endpoints).
   Despite increased aerobic energy production (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1),
   planarians were not able to cope with oxidative stress induced by the
   highest PQ concentrations, since lipid peroxidation levels were
   significantly increased (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) concomitantly with a
   significant decrease of tGSH (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1). These results
   showed that planarians were unable to cope with oxidative stress induced
   by PQ with consequent impairments of behavior and regeneration despite
   an increased aerobic energy production. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Toxicological Assessment of a Lignin Core Nanoparticle Doped with Silver
   as an Alternative to Conventional Silver Core Nanoparticles},
Journal = {ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Elevated levels of silver in the environment are anticipated with an
   increase in silver nanoparticle (AgNP) production and use in consumer
   products. To potentially reduce the burden of silver ion release from
   conventional solid core AgNPs, a lignin-core particle doped with silver
   ions and surface-stabilized with a polycationic electrolyte layer was
   engineered. Our objective was to determine whether any of the
   formulation components elicit toxicological responses using embryonic
   zebrafish. Ionic silver and free surface stabilizer were the most toxic
   constituents, although when associated separately or together with the
   lignin core particles, the toxicity of the formulations decreased
   significantly. The overall toxicity of lignin formulations containing
   silver was similar to other studies on a silver mass basis, and led to a
   significantly higher prevalence of uninflated swim bladder and yolk sac
   edema. Comparative analysis of dialyzed samples which had leached their
   loosely bound Ag+, showed a significant increase in mortality
   immediately after dialysis, in addition to eliciting significant
   increases in types of sublethal responses relative to the freshly
   prepared non-dialyzed samples. ICP-OES/MS analysis indicated that silver
   ion release from the particle into solution was continuous, and the rate
   of release differed when the surface stabilizer was not present.
   Overall, our study indicates that the lignin core is an effective
   alternative to conventional solid core AgNPs for potentially reducing
   the burden of silver released into the environment from a variety of
   consumer products.},

Title = {Mitochondrial superoxide generation induces a parkinsonian phenotype in
   zebrafish and huntingtin aggregation in human cells},
Journal = {FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {318-327},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Superoxide generation by mitochondria respiratory complexes is a major
   source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are capable of initiating
   redox signaling and oxidative damage. Current understanding of the role
   of mitochondrial ROS in health and disease has been limited by the lack
   of experimental strategies to selectively induce mitochondrial
   superoxide production. The recently-developed mitochondria-targeted
   redox cycler MitoParaquat (MitoPQ) overcomes this limitation, and has
   proven effective in vitro and in Drosophila. Here we present an in vivo
   study of MitoPQ in the vertebrate zebrafish model in the context of
   Parkinson's disease (PD), and in a human cell model of Huntington's
   disease (HD). We show that MitoPQ is 100-fold more potent than
   non-targeted paraquat in both cells and in zebrafish in vivo. Treatment
   with MitoPQ induced a parkinsonian phenotype in zebrafish larvae, with
   decreased sensorimotor reflexes, spontaneous movement and brain tyrosine
   hydroxylase (TH) levels, without detectable effects on heart rate or
   atrioventricular coordination. Motor phenotypes and TH levels were
   partly rescued with antioxidant or monoaminergic potentiation
   strategies. In a HD cell model, MitoPQ promoted mutant huntingtin
   aggregation without increasing cell death, contrasting with the complex
   I inhibitor rotenone that increased death in cells expressing either
   wild-type or mutant huntingtin. These results show that MitoPQ is a
   valuable tool for cellular and in vivo studies of the role of
   mitochondrial superoxide generation in redox biology, and as a trigger
   or co-stressor to model metabolic and neurodegenerative disease
   phenotypes.},

   Spontaneous Activity in Zebrafish Embryos},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Although cell-based assays exist, rapid and cost-efficient high-content
   screening (HCS) assays within intact organisms are needed to support
   prioritization for developmental neurotoxicity testing in rodents.
   During zebrafish embryogenesis, spontaneous tail contractions occur from
   late-segmentation (similar to 19 h postfertilization, hpf) through early
   pharyngula (similar to 29 hpf) and represent the first sign of
   locomotion. Using transgenic zebrafish (flil:egfp) that stably express
   eGFP beginning at similar to 14 hpf, we have developed and optimized a
   384-well-based HCS assay that quantifies spontaneous activity Within
   single zebrafish embryos after exposure to test chemicals in a
   concentration-response format. Following static exposure of one embryo
   per well from 5 to 25 hpf, automated image acquisition procedures and
   custom analysis protocols were used to quantify total body area and
   spontaneous activity in live embryos. Survival and imaging success rates
   across control plates ranged from 87.5 to 100\% and 93.3-100\%,
   respectively. Using our optimized procedures, we screened 16 chemicals
   within the US EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library, and found that exposure to
   abamectin and emamectin benzoate-both potent avermectins-abolished
   spontaneous activity in the absence of gross malformations. Overall,
   compared to existing locomotion-based zebrafish assays conducted later
   in development, this method provides a simpler discovery platform for
   identifying potential developmental neurotoxicants.},

Title = {Neurotoxicity of the Parkinson Disease-Associated Pesticide Ziram Is
   Synuclein-Dependent in Zebrafish Embryos},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},

Volume = {124},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to the commonly used dithiocarbamate (DTC)
   pesticides is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson
   disease (PD), although the mechanisms by which they exert their toxicity
   are not completely understood.
   OBJECTIVE: We studied the mechanisms of zirams (a DTC fungicide)
   neurotoxicity in vivo.
   METHODS: Zebrafish (ZF) embryos were utilized to determine zirams
   effects on behavior, neuronal toxicity, and the role of synuclein in its
   toxicity.
   RESULTS: Nanomolar-range concentrations of ziram caused selective loss
   of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior. Because
   ziram increases alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) concentrations in rat
   primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF
   gamma-synuclein 1 (gamma 1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms, and ZF
   gamma 1 appears to be the closest functional homologue to alpha-syn. We
   found that recombinant ZF gamma 1 formed fibrils in vitro, and
   overexpression of ZF gamma 1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of
   neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity in a manner similar to that of
   alpha-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF gamma 1 with morpholinos and
   disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR01 prevented
   zirams DA toxicity.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ziram is selectively toxic to DA
   neurons in vivo, and this toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These
   findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms by
   which pesticides may cause PD.},

Abstract = {Concentrations, profiles and muscle-liver distribution of halogenated
   natural products (HNPs) and anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs) were investigated in five large pelagic fish species and one
   smaller planktivore fish species from the Western Indian Ocean. Analysis

   (6-MeO-BDE 47 or BC-3) and 2,3,3 `,4,4 `,5,5 `-heptachloro-1
   `-methyl-1,2 `-bipyrrole (Q1), along with varied contributions of

   Non-targeted gas chromatography coupled with electron capture negative

Abstract = {Given the compound differences between tris(2-butoxyethyl)- and
   tris(2-cloroethyl) phosphate (TBOEP and TCEP, respectively), we
   hypothesized that exposure of juvenile salmon to TBOEP and TCEP will
   produce compound-specific differences in uptake and bioaccumulation
   patterns, resulting in potential formation of OH-metabolites. Juvenile
   salmon were exposed to waterborne TCEP or TBOEP (0.04, 0.2 and 1 mg/L)
   for 7 days. The muscle accumulation was measured and bioconcentration
   factor (BCF) was calculated, showing that TCEP was less accumulative and
   resistant to metabolism in salmon than TBOEP. Metabolite formations were
   only detected in TBOEP-exposed fish, showing seven phase I
   biotransformation metabolites with hydroxylation, ether cleavage or
   combination of both reactions as important metabolic pathways. In vitro
   incubation of trout S9 liver fraction with TBOEP was performed showing
   that the generated metabolite patterns were similar to those found in
   muscle tissue exposed in vivo. However, another OH-TBOEP isomer and an
   unidentified metabolite not present in in vivo exposure were observed
   with the trout S9 incubation. Overall, some of the observed metabolic
   products were similar to those in a previous in vitro report using human
   liver microsomes and some metabolites were identified for the first time
   in the present study. Toxicological analysis indicated that TBOEP
   produced less effect, although it was taken up faster and accumulated
   more in fish muscle than TCEP. TCEP produced more severe toxicological
   responses in multiple fish organs. However, liver biotransformation
   responses did not parallel the metabolite formation observed in
   TBOEP-exposed fish.},

   indicated the presence of quercetin (<5), quercetrin (6.54 mg/g) and

   mu g/L) and EHSm (5, 15, 25 mg/L). EHSm (25 mg/L) was able to reverse
   the behavioral damage induced by ROT in the entries and time spent in

   prevented oxidative stress (TBARS e total thiols), inflammation and
   dopamine uptake triggered by ROT, evidenced of increased on the CAT, SOD

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Volume = {120},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) organize knowledge on the progression of
   toxicity through levels of biological organization. By determining the
   linkages between toxicity events at different levels, AOPs lay the
   foundation for mechanism-based alternative testing approaches to hazard
   assessment. Here, we focus on growth impairment in fish to illustrate
   the initial stages in the process of AOP development for chronic
   toxicity outcomes. Growth is an apical endpoint commonly assessed in
   chronic toxicity tests for which a replacement is desirable. Based on
   several criteria, we identified reduction in food intake to be a
   suitable key event for initiation of middle-out AOP development. To
   start exploring the upstream and downstream links of this key event, we
   developed three AOP case studies, for pyrethroids, selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and cadmium. Our analysis showed that the
   effect of pyrethroids and SSRIs on food intake is strongly linked to
   growth impairment, while cadmium causes a reduction in growth due to
   increased metabolic demands rather than changes in food intake.
   Locomotion impairment by pyrethroids is strongly linked to their effects
   on food intake and growth, while for SSRIs their direct influence on
   appetite may play a more important role. We further discuss which
   alternative tests could be used to inform on the predictive key events
   identified in the casp studies. In conclusion, our work demonstrates how
   the AOP concept can be used in practice to assess critically the
   knowledge available for specific chronic toxicity cases and to identify
   existing knowledge gaps and potential alternative tests. (c) 2014 The

Abstract = {It is known that pesticides such as abamectin (ABA) present cytotoxic
   effects on target organisms; however, the effects from ABA on non-target
   organisms such as amphibians are poorly understood. The aim of the
   current study is to investigate whether the exposure of Lithobates
   catesbeianus tadpoles to different abamectin concentrations {[}12.5, 25,
   and 50\% of the median lethal concentration (LC50)] leads to behavioral
   and morphological changes and/or generates possible cytotoxic effects.
   The aggregation test showed that tadpoles exposed to the highest ABA
   concentrations did not respond to the stimulus from non-familial and
   unrelated co-specific species. On the other hand, there was no
   difference in the total number of crossings in the central line of the
   herein adopted apparatus between groups; it suggests that ABA did not
   affect animal locomotion in the aforementioned test, although changes in
   the normal swimming pattern of tadpoles exposed to the pesticide were
   recorded in the swimming activity test. In addition, the herein exposed
   animals did not respond to the predatory stimulus in the antipredator
   response test; this result suggests defensive response deficit caused by
   the pesticide. With respect to their oral morphology, tadpoles exposed
   to ABA presented the lowest scores for mandibular pigmentation and
   structures, as well as for dentition condition. Finally, it was possible
   seeing that the exposure to ABA, even at the lowest concentration
   (12.5\% of the LC50), resulted in nuclear changes in the erythrocytes of
   the animals; these changes became evident in the increased number of
   micronuclei and in other nuclear abnormalities. Thus, besides confirming
   the cytotoxic potential of ABA in amphibians, the current study
   corroborates the hypothesis that the exposure to the herein investigated
   pesticide leads to behavioral and morphological changes in tadpoles,
   fact that may negatively reflect on the survival, as well as on natural
   populations of these individuals.},

Title = {Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Induce Developmental Toxicity During
   Zebrafish Embryogenesis, Especially in the Inner Ear},

Abstract = {In vertebrates, carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play important roles in ion
   transport and pH regulation in many organs, including the eyes, kidneys,
   central nervous system, and inner ear. In aquatic organisms, the enzyme
   is inhibited by various chemicals present in the environment, such as
   heavy metals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. In this study, the
   effects of CA inhibitors, i.e., sulfonamides {[}ethoxyzolamide (EZA),
   acetazolamide (AZA), and dorzolamide (DZA)], on zebrafish embryogenesis
   were investigated. In embryos treated with the sulfonamides, abnormal
   development, such as smaller otoliths, an enlarged heart, an irregular
   pectoral fin, and aberrant swimming behavior, was observed. Especially,
   the development of otoliths and locomotor activity was severely affected
   by all the sulfonamides, and EZA was a consistently stronger inhibitor
   than AZA or DZA. In the embryos treated with EZA, inner ear hair cells
   containing several CA isoforms, which provide HCO3 (-) to the endolymph
   for otolith calcification and maintain an appropriate pH there, were
   affected. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining indicated that the
   hair cell damage in the inner ear and pectral fin is due to apoptosis.
   Moreover, RNA measurement demonstrated that altered gene expression of
   cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-related proteins p53, p21, p27, and
   Bcl-2 occurred even at 0.08 ppm with which normal development was
   observed. This finding suggests that a low concentration of EZA may
   affect embryogenesis via the apoptosis pathway. Thus, our findings
   demonstrated the importance of potential risk assessment of CA
   inhibition, especially regarding the formation of otoliths as a one of
   the most sensitive organs in embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {To investigate the impacts of the widely used chiral herbicide
   fenoxaprop-ethyl (FE) on aquatic organisms, the enrichment, metabolism,
   acute toxicity, and oxidative stress of fenoxaprop-ethyl and its main
   metabolites fenoxaprop (FA), ethyl-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propanoate
   (EHPP), 2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propanoic acid (HPPA), and
   6-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzoxazol-2-one (CDHB) in zebrafish were studied.
   The enantioselectivity of fenoxaprop-ethyl and its chiral metabolites
   was also determined. Fenoxaprop-ethyl quickly degraded in zebrafish by
   aquatic exposure. FA, HPPA, and CDHB were the main metabolites that were
   enriched in the zebrafish. In the metabolism experiment, the half-lives
   of the metabolites were 0.92-1.72 days in zebrafish. The R-enantiomers
   of FA and HPPA were preferentially enriched and metabolized with
   enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of 0.65-0.85. According to the 96-h acute
   toxicity, FA, HPPA, EHPP, and CDHB were less toxic to zebrafish than FE,
   following the order of FE > CDHB > EHPP > FA > HPPA. The S-enantiomers
   of FE, FA, CDHB, and EHPP were more toxic than the R-enantiomers. FE and
   its metabolites could significantly increase catalase (CAT) and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the malondialdehyde (MDA)
   content in gill and liver tissues, indicating their oxidative stress,
   and these effects were also enantioselective. This work could supply
   more information for evaluating the risks of fenoxaprop-ethyl on aquatic
   organisms concerning their metabolites and enantiomers.},

   series of fish behavior responding to environmental stress},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {433},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Response behaviors of animals to stressors are complicated. Especially,
   it is difficult to analyze temporal data in addressing the time course
   development of behavioral states to stressors. Not much study has been
   conducted in identifying the short-term behavior conditions of indicator
   organisms responding to stressors. Hence, in the present study, we
   selected three temporal networks, Temporal Kohonen Map (TKM), Recurrent
   Self-Organizing Map (RSOM), and Recursive Self-Organizing Map (RecSOM)
   to characterize the behavior strength of individual fish exposed to
   Atrazine (ATZ, 0.12 mg/L) for 15 days. The trained networks were able to
   detect the characteristic behavior strength segments presenting the
   Stepwise Behavior Response Model (SBRM). TKM was found suitable for
   detecting strong curves in a short training time, but clustering was
   limited in grouped segments. In contrast, RecSOM was found to be most
   suitable for detecting behavior segments with both high and low contrast
   response under toxic exposure. RecSOM was effective in clustering but
   could not detect segments with strong changes. Finally, our results
   presented that the temporal SOMs, especially RecSOMs, were feasible in
   identifying short-term time series data and could be utilized for
   on-line monitoring of test organisms under stressful conditions.},

Title = {Dopaminergic Co-Regulation of Locomotor Development and Motor Neuron
   Synaptogenesis is Uncoupled by Hypoxia in Zebrafish},
Journal = {ENEURO},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Hypoxic injury to the developing human brain is a complication of
   premature birth and is associated with long-term impairments of motor
   function. Disruptions of axon and synaptic connectivity have been linked
   to developmental hypoxia, but the fundamental mechanisms impacting motor
   function from altered connectivity are poorly understood. We
   investigated the effects of hypoxia on locomotor development in
   zebrafish. We found that developmental hypoxia resulted in decreased
   spontaneous swimming behavior in larva, and that this motor impairment
   persisted into adulthood. In evaluation of the diencephalic dopaminergic
   neurons, which regulate early development of locomotion and constitute
   an evolutionarily conserved component of the vertebrate dopaminergic
   system, hypoxia caused a decrease in the number of synapses from the
   descending dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT) to spinal cord
   motor neurons. Moreover, dopamine signaling from the DDT was coupled
   jointly to motor neuron synaptogenesis and to locomotor development.
   Together, these results demonstrate the developmental processes
   regulating early locomotor development and a requirement for
   dopaminergic projections and motor neuron synaptogenesis. Our findings
   suggest new insights for understanding the mechanisms leading to motor
   disability from hypoxic injury of prematurity.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {145},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most widely used insecticides and has
   been found in both urban and rural water bodies. In this study, we
   studied variations in the social behavioral patterns, swimming behavior,
   and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of Japanese medaka
   exposed to lethal (0.12 mg/L) and sublethal (0.012 mg/L) concentrations
   of CPF after different exposure times. Group behavior performance
   (schooling, shoaling, and solitary) was determined on day 4 of lethal
   exposure and on days 4, 8, and 12 of sublethal exposure. Swimming speed
   and brain AChE activity were measured on days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of
   sublethal CPF exposure. We observed significant decreases in social
   behavior and swimming speed (i.e., hypoactivity) in fish exposed to
   lethal CPF concentrations for 4 days. At the sublethal concentration,
   there was increased schooling duration and hyperactivity of fish on day
   8 but not on day 4. In contrast, 12 days of sublethal CPF exposure
   resulted in social behavior responses similar to those after 4 days'
   lethal exposure, i.e., significant decreases in schooling frequency and
   duration with a notable increase in duration of solitary behavior. Brain
   AChE activity was inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Altered fish
   behavior in response to organophosphorus pesticides such as CPF may be
   mediated by more than AChE inhibition alone.},

Title = {Neuromodulatory effect of cinnamon oil on behavioural disturbance,

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of
   deltamethrin (DLM)on brain function and to find whether DLM-induced
   neurotoxicity is prevented by the treatment with cinnamon oil. Four
   groups of ten Wistar albino male rats each were used. Group I (control)
   received saline only. Group II received cinnamon oil alone at 0.5 mg/kg
   B.W. intraperitonally, whereas Group III received orally DLM alone at 6
   mg/kg B.W. Groups IV was treated with cinnamon oil plus DLM for 21 days
   to induce neurotoxicity. Rat behaviour, brain acetylcholine esterase
   (AChE), serotonin, oxidative stress profile were assessed. Serum
   sampling for the assessment of corticosterone concentration was also
   carried out. Finally, we demonstrate the gene expression of CYP1A1 and
   iNOS and the histological picture of the brain. Considering the
   behaviour assessment, DLM administration alone caused neurobehavioral
   deficits manifested by anxiety-like behavior which represented in a
   marked decrease in the sleeping frequency and duration, and marked
   increase the digging frequency and a wake non-active behavior duration.
   Moreover, the open field result showed a significant decrease in central
   square entries and duration. The neurochemical analysis revealed that
   DLM significantly suppressed AChE activity and elevated serotonin and
   corticosterone concentrations. Furthermore, results revealed that the
   brain reduced glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were significantly
   altered in DLM treated rats. Neurochemical disturbances were confirmed
   by histopathological changes in the brain. Furthermore, DLM up-regulates
   the mRNA expression of brain CYP1A1 and iNOS. Co-treatment with cinnamon
   oil exhibited significant improvement in behavioural performance and the
   brain antioxidant capacities with an increase in AChE activity and
   diminished the concentration of serotonin, serum corticosterone and MDA.
   Cinnamon oil treatment resulted in down-regulation of CYP1A1 and iNOS
   and improve the histologically picture. In conclusion, cinnamon oil
   ameliorated DLM-induced neurotoxicity through preventing oxidative
   stress-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis of brain in rats.},

Title = {Optimization of the spontaneous tail coiling test for fast assessment of
   neurotoxic effects in the zebrafish embryo using an automated workflow
   in KNIME (R)},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {81},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Neuroactive chemicals are frequently detected in the environment. At
   sufficiently high concentrations or within mixtures, they could provoke
   neurotoxic effects and neurological diseases to organisms and humans.
   Fast identification of such neuroactive compounds in the environment
   could help in hazard assessment and risk mitigation. Behavior change is
   considered as an important endpoint and might be directly or indirectly
   connected to a neuroactive mode of action. For a fast evaluation of
   environmental samples and pure substances, we optimized the measurement
   of a behavioral endpoint in zebrafish embryos - the spontaneous tail
   coiling (STC). Evaluation of results is automated via the use of a
   workflow established with the KNIME (R) software. Analysis duration and
   developmental stage were optimized to 1 min and 25 +/- 1 hpf
   respectively during measurement. Exposing the embryos in a group of 10
   or 20 and acclimatizing for 30 min at room temperature proved to be
   reliable. The optimized method was used to investigate neurotoxic
   effects of 18 substances with different modes of action (MoA). The STC
   WA accurately detected the effect of 8 out of 11 neuroactive substances
   (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon, paraoxon-methyl, abamectin,
   carbamazepine, propafenone and diazepam). Aldicarb and nicotine showed
   subtle effects which were considered to be conditional and imidacloprid
   showed no effect. For substances with unknown neuroactive MoA, 3
   substances did not provoke any effect on the STC (pyraclostrobin, diuron
   and daunorubicin-hydrochloride) while 4 other substances provoked an
   increased STC (hexaconazole, aniline, dimethyl-sulfoxide and
   3,4-dichloroaniline). Such unexpected effects indicate possible
   neuroactive side effects or unknown mechanisms of action that impact on
   the STC. In conclusion, the optimized STC parameters and the automated
   analysis in KNIME (R) indicate opportunities for the harmonization of
   the STC WA and further development for prospective and diagnostic
   testing.},

Abstract = {In the experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a well-known
   neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine or MPTP,
   pesticides like benomyl, paraquat,etc. are successfully used to induce a
   Parkinson's disease in human and nonhuman primates, which can be
   reversed by the drugs such as L-DOPA. A review on the alternative
   methods and alternative models in Parkinson's disease is documented here
   to understand their advantages and importance. Earlier researchers
   proved MPTP is effective in the goldfish, which reliably mirrors the
   neurochemical and behavioral changes caused by MPTP in the higher
   vertebrates. Gold fish brain has the ``nucleus pars medialis,{''}
   similar to the substanitia nigra of the human brain can be destructed by
   chemicals like MPTP, 6-hydroxydopamine and has selective protection by
   L-Dopa (Levodopa) and MAO-B (Monoamine oxidase B) inhibitors. In
   addition, zebrafish along with mice was successfully employed in the
   study of pesticides leading to neurodegeneration in PD. As the current
   animal models often couldn't replicate the true pathophysiology of
   idiopathic PD, alternative models have gained importance in the
   research. Upon having a glance at different models utilized in
   Parkinson's disease studies, one can get an idea on preferring
   alternative models, especially the zebra fish model in the study of

Title = {The Conserved Dopaminergic Diencephalospinal Tract Mediates Vertebrate

Volume = {32},
Number = {39},

Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {The most conserved part of the vertebrate dopaminergic system is the
   orthopedia (otp)-expressing diencephalic neuronal population that
   constitutes the dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT). Although
   studies in the neonatal murine spinal cord in vitro suggest an early
   locomotor role of the DDT, the function of the DDT in developing
   vertebrates in vivo remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of
   the DDT in the locomotor development of zebrafish larvae. To assess the
   development of the behavioral and neural locomotor pattern, we used
   high-throughput video tracking in combination with peripheral nerve
   recordings. We found a behavioral and neural correspondence in the
   developmental switch from an immature to mature locomotor pattern.
   Blocking endogenous dopamine receptor 4 (D4R) signaling in vivo either
   before or after the developmental switch prevented or reversed the
   switch, respectively. Spinal transections of post-switch larvae
   reestablished the immature locomotor pattern, which was rescued to a
   mature-like pattern via spinal D4R agonism. Selective chemogenetic
   ablation of otp b (otpb) neurons that contribute to the DDT perpetuated
   the immature locomotor pattern in vivo. This phenotype was recapitulated
   by diencephalic transections that removed the dopaminergic otpb
   population and was rescued to a mature-like locomotor pattern by D4R
   agonism. We conclude that the dopaminergic otpb population, via the DDT,
   is responsible for spinal D4R signaling to mediate the developmental
   switch to the mature locomotor pattern of zebrafish. These results,
   integrated with the mammalian literature, suggest that the DDT
   represents an evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory system that is
   necessary for normal vertebrate locomotor development.},

Title = {Androgenic activation, impairment of the monoaminergic system and
   altered behavior in zebrafish larvae exposed to environmental
   concentrations of fenitrothion},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {775},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Fenitrothion is an organophosphorus insecticide usually found in aquatic
   ecosystems at concentrations in the range of low ng/L. In this
   manuscript we show that 24 h exposure to environmental concentrations of
   fenitrothion, from ng/L to low mu g/L, altered basal locomotor activity,
   visual-motor response and acoustic/vibrational escape response of
   zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, fenitrothion and expression of gap43a,
   gfap, atp2b1a, and mbp exhibited a significant non-monotonic
   concentration-response relationship. Once determined that environmental
   concentrations of fenitrothion were neurotoxic for zebrafish larvae, a
   computational analysis identified potential protein targets of this
   compound. Some of the predictions, including interactions with
   acetylcholinesterase, monoamine-oxidases and androgen receptor (AR),
   were experimentally validated. Binding to AR was the most suitable
   candidate for molecular initiating event, as indicated by both the
   up-regulation of cyp19a1b and sult2st3 and the non-monotonic
   relationship found between fenitrothion and the observed responses.
   Finally, when the integrity of the monoaminergic system was evaluated,
   altered levels of L-DOPA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA were found, as well as a
   significant up-regulation of slc18a2 expression at the lowest
   concentrations of fenitrothion. These data strongly suggest that
   concentrations of fenitrothion commonly found in aquatic ecosystems
   present a significant environmental risk for fish communities. (C) 2021

Abstract = {As a cycloaliphatic brominated flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane
   (HBCD) has been widely used in building thermal insulation and fireproof
   materials. However, there is little information on the bioconcentration
   as well as effects with respect to HBCD exposure in the aquatic
   environment. To investigate the bioconcentration of HBCD in tissues
   (muscle and liver) and its biochemical and behavioural effects, juvenile
   crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were exposed to different
   concentrations of technical HBCD (nominal concentrations, 2, 20, 200 mu
   g/L) for 7 days, using a flow-through exposure system. HBCD was found to
   concentrate in the liver and muscle with a terminal concentration of
   0.60 +/- 0.22 mu g/g lw (lipid weight) and 0.18 +/- 0.02 mu g/g lw,
   respectively, at an environmentally-relevant concentration (2 mu g/L).
   The total thyroxine and total triiodothyronine in the fish plasma were
   lowered as a result of exposure to the HBCD. Acetylcholinesterase
   activity in the brain was increased, while swimming activity was
   inhibited and shoaling inclination was enhanced after exposure to 200 mu
   g/L HBCD. Feeding rate was suppressed in the 20 and 200 mu g/L treatment
   groups. In summary, HBCD concentrations 10-100x higher than the current
   environmentally-relevant exposures induced adverse effects in the fish
   species tested in this study. These results suggest that increasing
   environmental concentrations and/or species with higher sensitivity than
   carp might be adversely affected by HBCD.},

Abstract = {The hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis plays a central role in
   the maintenance of homeostasis and disruptions in its function can have
   important implications for reproduction and other critical biological
   processes. A number of compounds found in aquatic environments are known
   to affect the HPG axis. In the present study, we used two-dimensional
   electrophoresis to investigate the proteome of female and male zebrafish
   brain after 96 h exposure to the fungicide prochloraz. Prochloraz has
   known effects on a number of key HPG molecules, including antagonism of
   Cyp17 and Cyp19 (aromatase). Twenty-eight proteins were shown to be
   differentially expressed in the brains of females and 22 in males.
   Proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS and identities were examined
   relative to brain function in the context of changing steroid hormone
   levels. There was little overlap between sexes in proteins exhibiting
   differential expression. Proteins with known roles in metabolism,
   learning, neuroprotection, and calcium regulation were determined to be
   differentially regulated. Relationships between identified proteins were
   also examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and females were shown
   to exhibit enrichment of several metabolic pathways. We used
   differentially expressed proteins to establish a putative classifier
   consisting of three proteins that was able to discriminate
   prochloraz-exposed from control females. Putatively impacted brain
   functions and specific protein changes that were observed have the
   potential to be generalized to other that similarly impact steroid
   hormone levels. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is widely used in agriculture and is considered one
   of the most toxic pesticides to fish. In this study, adult male
   zebrafish were exposed to CPF at concentrations of 30, 100 and 300 mu
   g/L for 21 days. It was observed that CPF not only induced oxidative
   stress but also caused gut microbiota dysbiosis in the gut. The
   malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased, and the glutathione (GSH)
   contents decreased in the gut of the CPF-treated group. For the gut
   microbiota, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of
   Proteobacteria showed a significant change after CPF exposure. At the
   genus level, approximately 25 types of bacteria in the gut changed
   significantly. In addition, based on a gas chromatography combined with
   mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, we found that 98 metabolites
   significantly influenced the zebrafish liver, and these changed
   metabolites were tightly related to several pathways, including glucose
   and lipid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid
   metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of some genes
   related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism decreased significantly in
   the livers of CPF-treated zebrafish. These results indicated that CPF
   exposure could induce hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in
   adult zebrafish. Taken together, our results suggest that CPF exposure
   causes hepatic lipid metabolism disorders that are associated with gut
   oxidative stress and microbiota dysbiosis in adult zebrafish.},

Title = {Freshwater Planarians as an Alternative Animal Model for Neurotoxicology},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {147},
Number = {1},
Pages = {270-285},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Traditional toxicology testing has relied on low-throughput, expensive
   mammalian studies; however, timely testing of the large number of
   environmental toxicants requires new in vitro and in vivo platforms for
   inexpensive medium- to high-throughput screening. Herein, we describe
   the suitability of the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as
   a new animal model for the study of developmental neurotoxicology. As
   these asexual animals reproduce by binary fission, followed by
   regeneration of missing body structures within approximately 1 week,
   development and regeneration occur through similar processes allowing us
   to induce neurodevelopment ``at will{''} through amputation. This short
   time scale and the comparable sizes of full and regenerating animals
   enable parallel experiments in adults and developing worms to determine
   development-specific aspects of toxicity. Because the planarian brain,
   despite its simplicity, is structurally and molecularly similar to the
   mammalian brain, we are able to ascertain neurodevelopmental toxicity
   that is relevant to humans. As a proof of concept, we developed a 5-step
   semiautomatic screening platform to characterize the toxicity of 9 known
   neurotoxicants (consisting of common solvents, pesticides, and
   detergents) and a neutral agent, glucose, and quantified effects on
   viability, stimulated and unstimulated behavior, regeneration, and brain
   structure. Comparisons of our findings with other alternative toxicology
   animal models, such as zebrafish larvae and nematodes, demonstrated that
   planarians are comparably sensitive to the tested chemicals. In
   addition, we found that certain compounds induced adverse effects
   specifically in developing animals. We thus conclude that planarians
   offer new complementary opportunities for developmental neurotoxicology
   animal models.},

Title = {Toxicological assessment of seven unregulated drinking water
   Disinfection By-products (DBPs) using the zebrafish embryo bioassay},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {742},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Disinfection By-products (DBPs) are formed during the chemical treatment
   of water for human consumption, by the reaction of raw water with
   chemical agents used in the different steps of the process. Disinfection
   is one of the most important steps, inactivating pathogens and
   preventing their regrowth during water distribution. However, it is also
   involved in DBPs formation due to the use of disinfectant agents, such
   as chlorine, which reacts with dissolved precursors, such as
   pharmaceuticals, toxins, pesticides, among others. Given their
   widespread occurrence, potential human health and (eco) toxicological
   impacts are of particular interest due to their potential
   carcinogenicity and various non-carcinogenic effects, such as endocrine
   disruption. In this study, the developmental toxicity of chemically-
   different unregulated DBPs was evaluated using zebrafish embryo
   bioassay. Embryos were exposed to different concentrations of the target
   DBPs and multiple endpoints, including, mortality, morphological
   abnormalities and locomotor behavior were assessed at specific
   developmental stages (24. 48, 72 and 96 hpf). The different families of
   DBPs tested included nitrosamines, aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. The
   results show that the effects were compound dependent, with EC10 values
   varying between 0.04 mg/L (2-ethyl-1-hexanal) to 9.2 mg/L
   (hexachloroacetone). Globally, several of the tested unregulated DBPs
   displayed higher toxicity when compared with the available data for some
   already regulated, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which highlights the
   importance of screening the toxicity of still untested and poorly
   characterized DBPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Maternal exposure to organophosphate flame retardants alters locomotor
   and anxiety-like behavior in male and female adult offspring},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals found in our
   environment that interrupt typical endocrine function. Some flame
   retardants (FRs) are EDCs as shown in their interaction with steroid and
   nuclear receptors. Humans are consistently exposed to flame retardants
   as they are used in everyday items such as plastics, clothing, toys, and
   electronics. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers were used as the major FR
   until 2004, when they were replaced by organophosphate flame retardants
   (OPFRs). Previous research in rodent models utilizing a commercial flame
   retardant mixture containing OPFRs reported alterations in anxiety-like
   behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) for rodents perinatally exposed
   to OPFRs. In the present study we utilize wild-type mice maternally
   exposed (gestational day 7 to postnatal day 14) to either an OPFR
   mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl), triphenyl phosphate, and
   tricresyl phosphate or a sesame seed oil vehicle. These mice were
   evaluated for anxiety-like behavior in adulthood on the open field test
   (OFT) and the light/dark box (LDB) as well as the EPM. Outcomes from the
   OFT and LDB indicate that males and females maternally exposed to OPFRs
   exhibit altered locomotor activity. Results of the EPM were sex-specific
   as we did not observe an effect in females; however, effects in males
   differed depending on exposure condition. Males maternally exposed to
   OPFRs exhibited an anxiolytic-like phenotype in contrast to their
   vehicle counterparts. This effect in perinatally OPFR-exposed males was
   not due to alterations in locomotor activity. Our research illustrates
   that there are sex- and exposure-dependent effects of perinatal OPFR
   exposure on adult locomotor and anxiety-like behaviors in a mouse model.},

Abstract = {Contaminant-induced feeding inhibition has direct and immediate
   consequences at higher levels of biological organization, by depressing
   the population consumption and thus hampering ecosystem functioning
   (e.g. grazing, organic matter decomposition). Thus, similarly to
   lethality and avoidance, feeding is mechanistically linked to ecosystem
   processes and is therefore an unequivocal ecologically meaningful
   response. The objective of the present study was to develop a short-term
   assay with the small freshwater fish Danio rerio, based on feeding. For
   this, a methodology to easily and precisely quantify feeding was first
   optimized: each fish was allowed to prey on ten live Daphnia magna
   juveniles, for 1 h, just before the end of a 48-h exposure test period.
   Secondly, copper sensitivity of feeding relatively to survival and
   growth was evaluated. At the growth EC20 (40 mu g L-1), feeding was
   inhibited by 53\%, and at the feeding EC50 (36 mu g L-1), mortality was
   negligible (1.3\%). Integrating feeding and survival revealed a 97\%
   depression in the population consumption at the LC50 (61 mu g L-1).
   Thirdly, the influence of pH, conductivity and hardness on the feeding
   background variability was assessed by assaying waters collected at
   eight reference sites and was found to be negligible, within tested
   ranges. Fourthly, feeding assays with natural waters contaminated with
   acid mine drainage confirmed the integration of lethality and feeding to
   be pertinent at estimating contaminant effects at higher levels of
   biological organization. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ECOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There has long been a great concern with growing anthropogenic
   contaminants and their ecological and toxicological effects on living
   organisms and the surrounding environment for decades. Metabolomics, a
   functional readout of cellular activity, can capture organismal
   responses to various contaminant-related stressors, acquiring direct
   signatures to illustrate the environmental behaviours of anthropogenic
   contaminants better. This review entails the application of metabolomics
   to profile metabolic responses of environmental organisms, e.g. animals
   (rodents, fish, crustacean and earthworms) and microorganisms (bacteria,
   yeast and microalgae) to different anthropogenic contaminants, including
   heavy metals, nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal
   products, persistent organic pollutants, and assesses their
   ecotoxicological impacts with regard to literature published in the
   recent five years. Contaminant-induced metabolism alteration and
   up/down-regulation of metabolic pathways are revealed in typical
   organisms. The obtained insights of variations in global metabolism
   provide a distinct understanding of how anthropogenic contaminants exert
   influences on specific metabolic pathways on living organisms. Thus with
   a novel ecotechnique of environmental metabolomics, risk assessments of
   anthropogenic contaminants are profoundly demonstrated. (C) 2021 The

Abstract = {The toxicological knowledge of mancozeb (MZ)-containing commercial
   formulations on non-target species is scarce and limited. Therefore, the
   objective of this work was to represent a realistic application scenario
   by evaluating the toxicity of environmental relevant and higher
   concentrations of a commercial formulation of MZ using zebrafish
   embryos. Following determination of the 96-h LC50 value, the embryos at
   the blastula stage (similar to 2 h post-fertilisation, hpf) were exposed
   to 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g L-1 of the active ingredient (similar to 40x
   lower than the 96-h LC50). During the exposure period (96 h), lethal,
   sublethal, and teratogenic parameters, as well as behaviour analysis, at
   120 hpf, were assayed. Biochemical parameters such as oxidative
   stress-linked enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
   glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)), reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) levels, and glutathione levels (GSH and GSSG), as
   well as the activity of degradation (glutathione S-transferase (GST) and
   carboxylesterase (CarE)), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE)), and anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related
   enzymes, were analysed at the end of the exposure period. Exposed
   embryos showed a marked decrease in the hatching rate and many
   malformations (cardiac and yolk sac oedema and spinal torsions), with a
   higher prevalence at the highest concentration. A dose-dependent
   decreased locomotor activity and a response to an aversive stimulus, as
   well as a light-dark transition decline, were observed at environmental
   relevant concentrations. Furthermore, the activities of SOD and GR
   increased while the activity of GST, AChE, and MDA contents decreased.
   Taken together, the involvement of mancozeb metabolites and the
   generation of ROS are suggested as responsible for the developmental
   phenotypes. While further studies are needed to fully support the
   hypothesis presented, the potential cumulative effects of
   mancozeb-containing formulations and its metabolites could represent an
   environmental risk which should not be disregarded.},

Abstract = {2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is one of the most commonly used
   herbicides worldwide. While the effects of 2,4-D in target organisms are
   well known, its consequences in nontarget organisms are not fully

   effects of the herbicide on mitochondrial energy metabolism, oxidative
   status, and exploratory behavior in adult zebrafish. Animal exposure to
   2,4-D increased cytochrome c oxidase and catalase activities and reduced
   SOD/CAT ratio, moreover, increased the total distance traveled and the
   number of crossings. Finally, animals exposed to 2,4-D spent more time
   in the upper zone of the tank and traveled a long distance in the upper
   zone. Overall, our results indicate the 2,4-D can provoke disabling
   effects in nontarget organisms. The obtained data showed that exposure
   to 2,4-D at environmentally relevant concentrations alters mitochondrial
   metabolism and antioxidant status and disturbs the zebrafish innate
   behavior.},

Title = {Assessing Combined Effects for Mixtures of Similar and Dissimilar Acting
   Neuroactive Substances on Zebrafish Embryo Movement},
Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Risk assessment of chemicals is usually conducted for individual
   chemicals whereas mixtures of chemicals occur in the environment.
   Considering that neuroactive chemicals are a group of contaminants that
   dominate the environment, it is then imperative to understand the
   combined effects of mixtures. The commonly used models to predict
   mixture effects, namely concentration addition (CA) and independent
   action (IA), are thought to be suitable for mixtures of similarly or
   dissimilarly acting components, respectively. For mixture toxicity
   prediction, one important challenge is to clarify whether to group
   neuroactive substances based on similar mechanisms of action, e.g., same
   molecular target or rather similar toxicological response, e.g., hyper-
   or hypoactivity (effect direction). We addressed this by using the
   spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of zebrafish embryos, which represents
   the earliest observable motor activity in the developing neural network,
   as a model to elucidate the link between the mechanism of action and
   toxicological response. Our objective was to answer the following two
   questions: (1) Can the mixture models CA or IA be used to predict
   combined effects for neuroactive chemical mixtures when the components
   share a similar mode of action (i.e., hyper- or hypoactivity) but show
   different mechanism of action? (2) Will a mixture of chemicals where the
   components show opposing effect directions result in an antagonistic
   combined effect? Results indicate that mixture toxicity of chemicals
   such as propafenone and abamectin as well as chlorpyrifos and
   hexaconazole that are known to show different mechanisms of action but
   similar effect directions were predictable using CA and IA models. This
   could be interpreted with the convergence of effects on the neural level
   leading to either a collective activation or inhibition of synapses. We
   also found antagonistic effects for mixtures containing substances with
   opposing effect direction. Finally, we discuss how the STC may be used
   to amend risk assessment.},

Abstract = {Fungal metabolites are considered to be most efficient tools to overcome
   the issues related to insecticide resistance and environmental
   pollution. The present study focus on the evaluation of the mosquito
   larvicidal efficacy of metabolites of seven indigenous fungal isolates
   (Penicillium sp. Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Rhizopus
   sp. Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp.) on the larvae of Aedes aegypti and
   Culex quinquefasciatus under the laboratory condition. The preliminary
   screening of the isolate, Penicillium sp. showed better larvicidal
   effect when compared to other fungi. The fungus was grown on Potato
   Dextrose Broth (PDB) in the laboratory (at 25 degrees C) and maintained
   in the relative humidity (at 76 +/- 4\% for 15 days). Larvicidal potency
   of mycelial ethyl acetate extract (MEAE) of Penicillium sp. was
   performed against 1st to 4th instars larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx.
   quinquefasciatus using four different concentrations (100, 200, 300, and
   500 mu g/ml) that showed better larval mortality values (mu g/ml) of
   LC50 = 6.554, 5.487, 6.874, 6.892, and the LC90 = 11.486, 10.366,
   12.879, 13.865 for Ae. aegypti and LC50 = 7.000, 13.943, 18.129, 25.212
   and the LC90 = 12.541, 23.761, 30.923, 41.696 for Cx. quinquefasciatus.
   Exposure of metabolite to larvae resulted in behavior changes i. e.,
   excitation, up and down with aggressive movement, anal papillae biting
   behavior. Further, the larvae treated with Penicillium sp. metabolite
   exhibited significant reduction in the levels of acetylcholinesterase.
   The 4th instar mosquito larvae treated with the 500 mu g/ml mycelia
   extract showed severe histological damages. During the antibacterial
   analysis of Penicillium sp.-mycelium the maximum growth inhibition zone
   was recorded in Shigella dysenteriae (31.2 mm) and Klebsiella pneumoniae
   (31.1 mm) followed by others. In addition, to check the toxicity of
   Penicillium sp. MEAE against embryos of Zebrafish, a model system, using
   different concentrations of metabolites (1.0, 0.5, 0.125 mg/ml, 30, 3.0,
   and 0.5 mu g/ml) and life-stage parameters were observed at 124 hpf.
   Furthermore, the Fourier Transformed Infrared and GCMS spectrum analysis
   of mycelium reflected several chemical compounds. The outcome of the
   study clearly shows that Penicillium sp. metabolites could serve as an
   ideal eco-friendly, single-step and inexpensive source for the control
   of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae.},

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common age associated
   neurodegenerative disease, which has been extensively studied for its
   etiology and phenotype. PD has been widely studied in alternate model
   system such as rodents towards understanding the role of neurotoxin by
   inducing PD. This study is aimed to understand the biomechanism of PD in
   zebrafish model system induced by
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The phenotype and
   role of various genes and proteins for Parkinsonism were tested and
   evaluated in this study using behavior, molecular and proteomic
   approaches. Zebrafish PD model induced by
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine showed a significant level
   of decrease in the movement with erratic swimming pattern and increased
   freezing bouts. CHCHD2, EEF2B, LRRK2, PARK7, PARK2, POLG, SNCGB and SYNB
   genes were differentially regulated at the transcript level in PD
   zebrafish. Similarly a total of 73 proteins were recognized as
   differentially expressed in the nervous system of zebrafish due to
   Parkinsonism based on quantitative proteomics approach. Proteins such as
   NEFL, MUNC13-1, NAV2 and GAPVD1 were down regulated in the zebrafish
   brain for the PD phenotype, which were associated with the neurological
   pathways. This zebrafish based PD model can be used as a potential model
   system for screening prospective drug molecules for PD.},

Title = {alpha-Synuclein amplifies cytoplasmic peroxide flux and oxidative stress
   provoked by mitochondrial inhibitors in CNS dopaminergic neurons in vivo},
Journal = {REDOX BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Convergent evidence implicates impaired mitochondrial function and
   alpha-Synuclein accumulation as critical upstream events in the
   pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, but comparatively little is known
   about how these factors interact to provoke neurodegeneration. We
   previously showed that alpha-Synuclein knockdown protected rat
   substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons from systemic exposure to the
   mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone. Here we show that motor
   abnormalities prior to neuronal loss in this model are associated with
   extensive alpha-Synuclein-dependent cellular thiol oxidation. In order
   to elucidate the underlying events in vivo we constructed novel
   transgenic zebrafish that co-express, in dopaminergic neurons: (i) human
   alpha-Synuclein at levels insufficient to provoke neurodegeneration or
   neurobehavioral abnormalities; and (ii) genetically-encoded ratiometric
   fluorescent biosensors to detect cytoplasmic peroxide flux and
   glutathione oxidation. Live intravital imaging of the intact zebrafish
   CNS at cellular resolution showed unequivocally that alpha-Synuclein
   amplified dynamic cytoplasmic peroxide flux in dopaminergic neurons
   following exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitors MPP + or
   rotenone. This effect was robust and clearly evident following either
   acute or prolonged exposure to each inhibitor. In addition, disturbance
   of the resting glutathione redox potential following exogenous hydrogen
   peroxide challenge was augmented by alpha-Synuclein. Together these data
   show that alpha-Synuclein is a critical determinant of the redox
   consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. The
   findings are important because the mechanisms underlying
   alpha-Synuclein-dependent reactive oxygen species fluxes and antioxidant
   suppression might provide a pharmacological target in Parkinson's
   disease to prevent progression from mitochondrial dysfunction and
   oxidative stress to cell death.},

Title = {Is UV radiation changing the toxicity of compounds to zebrafish embryos?},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {145-152},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {At ecosystems level, environmental parameters such as temperature, pH,
   dissolved oxygen concentration and intensity of UV radiation (UVR) have
   an important role on the efficiency of organisms' physiological and
   behavioral performances and consequently on the capacity of response to
   contaminants. Insignificant alterations of these parameters may
   compromise this response. In addition, these parameters can additionally
   alter chemical compounds by inducing their degradation, producing
   thereafter other metabolites. Understanding the combined effects of
   chemicals and environmental parameters is absolutely necessary for an
   adequate prediction of risk in aquatic environments. According to this
   scenario, this work aims at studying the combined toxicity of UVR and
   three xenobiotics: the biocide tridosan (TCS), the metal chromium (as
   potassium dichromate, PD) and the fungicide prochloraz (PCZ). To achieve
   this goal zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (3 h post fertilization (hpf))
   were exposed to several concentrations of each chemical combined with
   different UV intensities; mortality and eggs were recorded every 24 h
   for the all test duration (96 h). Results showed different response
   patterns depending on the toxicant, stress levels and duration of
   exposure. The combination of UVR and TCS indicated a dose ratio
   deviation where synergism was observed when UVR was the dominant
   stressor (day 2). The combination of UVR and PD presented a dose level
   dependency at day 3 indicating antagonism at low stress levels, changing
   with time where at day 4, a dose ratio deviation showed statistically
   that synergism occurred at higher PD concentrations. Finally, UVR
   combined with PCZ indicated a dose ratio at day 3 and dose level
   deviation at day 4 of exposure, suggesting a synergistic response when
   PCZ is the dominant stressor in the combination. The obtained results in
   this study highlighted the importance of taking into account the
   possible interaction of stressors and time of exposure to better predict
   environmental risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of acetochlor on neurogenesis and behaviour in zebrafish at
   early developmental stages},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {954-964},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The herbicide acetochlor is used in most parts of the world and is
   frequently detected in agricultural land and surface water; however,
   knowledge on the neurotoxicity of acetochlor is limited. Here, to test
   the effects of acetochlor on zebrafish development and behaviour,
   zebrafish embryos were exposed to acetochlor from 6 h post-fertilization
   (hpf) to 24 hpf, and larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were
   exposed to acetochlor for 24 h. Both were exposed to 5, 10, or 20 mg/L
   acetochlor. We found that acetochlor induced developmental
   abnormalities, locomotion variations and changes in the physiology and
   gene expression in the embryos and larvae. The abnormalities included
   spinal curvature, brain abnormalities, and the decreased formation of
   newborn neurons. Larval locomotion was decreased with increases in the
   absolute turn angle and sinuosity. Acetylcholinesterase activity reduced
   in both embryos and larvae, and the expression of genes that are
   involved in neurodevelopment and the neurotransmitter system altered.
   Acetochlor increased the production of ROS and the accumulation of MDA
   but decreased CAT activity in the embryonic brain. Additionally,
   acetochlor induced cell death in the brain and tail spinal cord, and the
   expression of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl2 and caspase 3 were
   significantly upregulated. Collectively, this is the first study to
   examine the molecular and physiological effects of acetochlor on
   neuronal development, and the potential mechanisms appear to be
   associated with oxidative stress and decreased AChE activity, which
   disrupt the expression of nervous system genes and apoptosis-related
   genes and finally lead to apoptosis and morphological malformations. (C)

Title = {The adverse effect of TCIPP and TCEP on neurodevelopment of zebrafish
   embryos/larvae},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {811-817},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris
   (2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) are two widely used chlorinated
   organophosphate flame retardants (ClOPFRs), and have been frequently
   detected in various environmental media. Concern is now growing whether
   TCIPP and TCEP can cause neurotoxicity since they have similar chemical
   structure with organophosphorus pesticide. Therefore, in this study,
   zebrafish embryos (2-120 h post-fertilization {[}hpf]) were exposed to
   TCIPP or TCEP (0, 100, 500 or 2500 mu g/L) or a model neurotoxicant,
   chlorpyrifos (CPF, 100 mu g/L) to investigate the adverse effects and
   possible mechanisms of TCIPP and TCEP on neurodevelopment. Our results
   showed that CPF exposure resulted in developmental toxicity including
   decreased hatching, survival rates and increased malformation rates
   (e.g., spinal curvature) as well as behavior changes such as decreased
   locomotive activity in dark stimulation. In contrast, TCIPP and TCEP
   showed no significant effects on developmental parameters, but caused
   similar effects on locomotive activity at high concentration, indicating
   that although not as potent as CPF. TCIPP and TCEP may still cause
   adverse effects on neurodevelopment. Furthermore, our results suggest
   that TCIPP and TCEP showed no effects on acetylcholine content or AChE
   activity, which were considered as the main targets of CPF. However,
   TCIPP and TCEP exposure can significantly down regulate the expression
   of selected genes and proteins related to neurodevelopment (e.g., mbp,
   syn2a, and alpha 1-tubulin) similar as CPF did. Besides that, TCIPP and
   TCEP can also affect the transcription of shha and gap43, which were not
   affected by CPF, pointing out a complex mechanism underlying TCIPP and
   TCEP's neurodevelopmental toxicity. Overall, our results demonstrated
   that TCEP and TCIPP may have adverse effect on the neurodevelopment of
   zebrafish embryos/larvae, but the underlying mechanism is not via the
   inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. (C) 2018 Published by

Abstract = {The escape response evoked by vibrational stimuli and its habituation,
   essential behaviors for fish larvae survival, can be altered by
   neurotoxic environmental pollutants commonly found in our aquatic
   ecosystems.
   In this study we have analyzed the suitability of the Vibrational
   Startle Response Assay (VSRA) to obtain mechanistic information about
   the mode of action (MoA) of the chemicals impairing the escape response
   and its habituation. As a proof of concept, the pathophysiological
   mechanisms behind the action of two common neurotoxic pesticides,
   chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) and imidacloprid, over their effects on arousal
   and habituation of the escape response were studied by using
   pharmacological antagonists of the nicotinic and muscarinic
   acetylcholine receptors, mecamylamine (MCA) and scopolamine,
   respectively. Furthermore, potential changes in the neurotransmitter
   profile were analyzed. Results revealed that whereas the effect of CPO
   on arousal was mainly mediated by the activation of nAChRs, its effect
   on habituation was mainly mediated by mAChRs. On the other hand,
   imidacloprid only affected larvae arousal which was found to be mediated
   by a cholinergic independent mechanism. No association between
   behavioral effects on arousal or habituation in affected larvae was
   found with their corresponding neurotransmitter profile. These results
   confirm the suitability of VSRA to provide mechanistic information about
   the potential MoA of neuroactive compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Environmental levels of carbaryl impair zebrafish larvae behaviour: The
   potential role of ADRA2B and HTR2B},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {431},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {The insecticide carbaryl is commonly found in indirectly exposed
   freshwater ecosystems at low concentrations considered safe for fish
   communities. In this study, we showed that after only 24 h of exposure
   to environmental concentrations of carbaryl (0.066-660 ng/L), zebrafish
   larvae exhibit impairments in essential behaviours. Interestingly, the
   observed behavioural effects induced by carbaryl were
   acetylcholinesterase-independent. To elucidate the molecular initiating
   event that resulted in the observed behavioural effects, in silico
   predictions were followed by in vitro validation. We identified two
   target proteins that potentially interacted with carbaryl, the alpha 2B
   adrenoceptor (ADRA2B) and the serotonin 2B receptor (HTR2B). Using a
   pharmacological approach, we then tested the hypothesis that carbaryl
   had antagonistic interactions with both receptors. Similar to yohimbine
   and SB204741, which are prototypic antagonists of ADRA2B and HTR2B,
   respectively, carbaryl increased the heart rate of zebrafish larvae.
   When we compared the behavioural effects of a 24-h exposure to these
   pharmacological antagonists with those of carbaryl, a high degree of
   similarity was found. These results strongly suggest that antagonism of
   both ADRA2B and HTR2B is the molecular initiating event that leads to
   adverse outcomes in zebrafish larvae that have undergone 24 h of
   exposure to environmentally relevant levels of carbaryl.},

Title = {Effects of three surfactants on the degradation and environmental risk
   of metolachlor in aquatic environment},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {300},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Surfactants and pesticides can be simultaneously detected in the
   environment by the reason of their widespread use and large amounts of
   emissions. Due to the special amphipathicity of surfactants, it may have
   special effects on the environmental behaviors and toxic effects of
   other substances in the environment. There are few relevant studies at
   present. In this study, the effects of three surfactants on the
   degradation of the amide pesticide metolachlor in water-sediment system
   were investigated. The study found that the three surfactants had no
   significant effect on the degradation of metolachlor in the system at
   environmental concentrations. However, at critical micelle
   concentration, cationic surfactant octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
   and nonionic surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ether promoted the
   degradation of metolachlor in water-sediment system. Anionic surfactant
   odium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) prolonged the degradation
   half-life of metolachlor. The presence of surfactants not only affected
   the environmental behavior of pesticides. When they coexisted with
   pesticides, the joint toxicity to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored.
   This study found that the combined effects of three surfactants and
   metolachlor on the acute developmental toxicity of zebrafish embryos
   were all synergistic effects. The combined effects of two ionic
   surfactants and metolachlor on the acute toxicity of adult zebrafish
   were synergistic effects. Further study showed that co-exposure of SDBS
   and metolachlor increased the absorption of metolachlor by zebrafish.
   Combined exposure of SDBS and metolachlor caused oxidative stress in
   brain, gill and liver of zebrafish. The results showed that the
   simultaneous presence of anionic surfactants and pesticides in the
   environment may increase the environmental risk of pesticides.},

   Acute Exposure to Atrazine Herbicide},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of atrazine exposure (5, 15,
   20, and 30 mg .L-1) on common carp and the ability of regeneration.
   During 96 h exposure we observed abnormal behavior in fish exposed to 20
   and 30mg .L-1. Mortality and histological alterations were noticed only
   in the group exposed to 30mg .L-1. Most experimental groups showed
   significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of haemoglobin, haematocrit,
   leukocyte, and lymphocyte and significantly higher values of monocytes,
   segmented and band neutrophile granulocytes, and also metamyelocytes and
   myelocytes. A significantly lower (P < 0.05) leukocyte count was also
   recorded in experimental groups (5 and 15 mg.L-1) after recovery period.
   Statistically significant (P < 0.05) alterations in glucose, total
   protein, lactate, phosphorus, calcium, and biopterin as well as in
   activities of ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH were found in most experimental
   groups. These changes were most apparent in the groups exposed to 20 and
   30mg .L-1. Most of the indices were found to be restored after the 7-day
   recovery period with the exception of LDH, ALT, and lactate in the group
   exposed to 15mg .L-1. Our results showed that atrazine exposure had a
   profound negative influence on selected indices and also on histological
   changes of common carp.},

Title = {Embryonic zebrafish response to a commercial formulation of azoxystrobin
   at environmental concentrations},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {211},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Azoxystrobin is a broad-spectrum strobilurin fungicide for use on a wide
   range of crops available to end-users as formulated products. Due to its
   extensive application, it has been detected in aquatic ecosystems,
   raising concerns about its environmental impact, which is still poorly
   explored. The objective of this work was to study the effects of a
   commercial formulation of azoxystrobin in the zebrafish embryo model.
   Sublethal and lethal effects were monitored during the exposure period
   from 2 h post fertilisation (hpf) to 96 hpf after exposure to
   azoxystrobin concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1). The responses of
   antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
   glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)) as well as
   detoxifying enzymes (glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and
   carboxylesterase (CarE)) were evaluated at 96 hpf. Similarly,
   glutathione levels (reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG) glutathione),
   neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) and anaerobic
   respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related enzymes were assayed.
   At 120 hpf, larvae from each group were used for behaviour analysis.
   Results from this study showed concentration dependent teratogenic
   effects, particularly by increasing the number of malformations (yolk
   and eye), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration.
   However, it was found that the lowest concentration induced a high
   generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased activity of
   SOD, GST, and CarE. In addition, GR and GSSG levels were decreased by
   the lowest concentration, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative
   stress, which is also supported by the increased AChE activity and
   absence of behavioural changes. These findings advance the knowledge of
   the azoxystrobin developmental and environmental impacts, which may
   impose ecotoxicological risks to non-target species.},

Title = {Embryonic exposure to fenbuconazole inhibits gametogenesis in adult
   zebrafish by targeting gonads not brain},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {228},
Month = {DEC 25},
Abstract = {Fenbuconazole (FBZ) is widely used in agriculture. The current study was
   conducted to evaluate the influence of embryonic exposure to FBZ on
   reproduction in adult zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to 5, 50 and 500
   ng/L FBZ for 72 h and then raised in clean water until adulthood. The
   result showed that the percentage of mature gametes was significantly
   reduced in adult zebrafish. The fertilization rate and survival rate of
   F1 embryos were decreased when the exposed fish were mated with
   untreated fish. The transcription of brain gnrh3, fsh13 and lh gamma in
   adult fish was upregulated, while the levels of 1713-estradiol and
   testosterone were not significantly changed in all treated groups,
   indicating that the reproduction-related genes in brain was not
   responsible for the reduced reproductive ability. The downregulated
   transcription of fshr, lhr, ar and esr2 in the gonads indicated the
   dysfunction of Sertoli and Leydig cells. Notably, downregulated
   transcription and upregulated methylation levels of genes related to
   germ cells were observed in treated F0 larvae and adult gonads. The
   elevated methylation levels of piwil1 and dnmt6 in the testes and vasa
   and dazl in the ovary were matched with the alterations in the
   expression of these genes, suggesting that germ cells are the main
   targets of FBZ. These results provide new mechanism underlying
   reproductive toxicity in fish caused by chemicals, and give potential
   retroactive biomarkers for monitoring reproductive toxic pollutants.},

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphorous pesticide, can be found in
   aquatic ecosystems at concentrations of up to several hundred nanograms
   per liter because of water runoff from treated crops. While some studies
   have shown that low concentrations of CPF may have adverse effects on
   aquatic species, comparatively little is known about its effect on fish
   embryos and larvae. To investigate the developmental effects of CPF,
   rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eyed-stage embryos were exposed in
   semistatic conditions to 0.3 and 3 mu g/L of CPF up to the end of the
   sac-fry stage, 3 weeks, at 12 degrees C. Several endpoints were analyzed
   including survival, hatching delay, hatching success, biometry, swimming
   activity, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content,
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and gene expression. At the end of
   the 3-week exposure, larvae exposed to the highest concentration of CPF
   were less mobile compared to the control and the lowest CPF conditions.
   No significant differences in AChE activity were observed in either set
   of CPF conditions compared to control, but it was significantly reduced
   for larvae exposed to 3 mu g/L compared to those exposed to 0.3 mu g/L
   of CPF. Expression of genes that encoded estrogen receptor beta was
   downregulated for larvae exposed to both CPF concentrations. Expression
   of cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 was also significantly
   repressed but only on larvae exposed to the highest concentration of
   CPF. Our results indicated that subchronic exposure to environmental
   concentrations of CPF could lead to sublethal effects on early-life
   stages of rainbow trout, especially effects on swimming activity that
   could affect foraging activity and escaping from predators. Environ

Abstract = {The measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) provides a

   the number of embryos, concentrations of inhibitors, and time points. We
   determined the factors, i.e., three embryos, 12.5 mu M of oligomycin, 8
   mu M of carbonyl cyanaide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP),
   and 24 hpf (hours post-fertilization) time point, for obtaining the
   typical pattern of OCR in dechorinated zebrafish embryos. After
   confirming the determinants upon exposure of triclosan, the inhibition
   of OCR was measured in zebrafish embryos exposed to two major OPFRs,
   triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate

   basal respiration for TPHP, and in basal and maxima] respiration for
   TDCIPP exposure, respectively. We suggest the optimum conditions of the

Title = {Reproductive Toxicity of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) on Javanese
   Medaka (Oryzias javanicus, Bleeker 1854)},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Compound 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a degradation product of some
   herbicide and intermediate industrial chemicals of many products.
   Unregulated use of 3,4-DCA affects the reproduction of non-target
   organisms. In this study, the potential reproductive toxicity of 3,4-DCA
   on Javanese medaka, a native sentinel organism distributed around
   aquatic ecosystems of Southern Asia, was evaluated. Low fecundity was
   observed in female exposed fish to 250 mu g/L of 3,4-DCA. Gonad tissue
   alternation and interference of gametes development were observed both
   in male and female exposed fish. The response pattern indicated that a
   low concentration of 3,4-DCA exerted endocrine disruption in Javanese
   medaka. This finding would provide additional data on the toxicity
   effect of 3,4-DCA, and it will strengthen the potential of native
   species in monitoring local and regional aquatic environments.
   Compound 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a metabolite of several urea
   herbicides and intermediate chemical of several industrial products.
   Moreover, 3,4-DCA has been frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems
   around the world. This aniline is more toxic than the parent chemicals,
   and it affects non-target organisms. This study evaluated a 21-day
   reproductive response of an emerging aquatic vertebrate model, Javanese
   medaka (Oryzias javanicus), exposed to 3,4-DCA. Fecundity and gonads
   histopathology were observed. The spawning rate and fertilisation
   reduced significantly in the highest exposed-group (250 mu g/L).
   Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly low in females exposed to
   250 mu g/L. No substantial structural alteration of male gonads.
   However, oocyte development and ovarian cell structure were disrupted in
   250 mu g/L exposed females. The gonadal developmental was not affected
   in the males; however, a significant reduction in the developmental of
   female gonads was observed at 250 mu g/L. These results show that
   3,4-DCA interfere with the reproduction of Javanese medaka through
   fecundity and alteration of gonadal tissues.},

   disease, mostly above 55 years of age. It is identified by dopaminergic
   neuron loss in the striatum's Substantia nigra \& dopamine loss (DA).
   The disease of Parkinson is the second most widespread neurodegenerative
   disorder. It adversely affects the motor system as the disease increases
   the destruction of the motor system. It is also known that it also
   affects almost other components of the brain, but slowly. By using these
   animal models, we got to know the process of PD, its etiology, its
   pathology, molecular mechanisms, and numerous other disorders.
   Experimental models are carried out using theses different agents such

Abstract = {Because brominated flame retardants are being banned or phased out
   worldwide, organophosphate flame retardants have been used as
   alternatives on a large scale and have thus become ubiquitous
   environmental contaminants; this raises great concerns about their
   environmental health risk and toxicity. Considering that previous
   research has identified the nervous system as a sensitive target,
   Japanese medaka were used as an aquatic organism model to evaluate the
   developmental neurotoxicity of 4 organophosphate flame retardants:
   triphenyl phosphate, tri-n-butyl phosphate,
   tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, and tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP).
   The embryo toxicity test showed that organophosphate flame retardant
   exposure could decrease hatchability, delay time to hatching, increase
   the occurrence of malformations, reduce body length, and slow heart
   rate. Regarding locomotor behavior, exposure to the tested
   organophosphate flame retardants (except TCEP) for 96 h resulted in
   hypoactivity for medaka larvae in both the free-swimming and the
   dark-to-light photoperiod stimulation test. Changes of
   acetylcholinesterase activity and transcriptional responses of genes
   related to the nervous system likely provide a reasonable explanation
   for the neurobehavioral disruption. Overall, the present study clearly
   demonstrates the developmental neurotoxicity of various organophosphate
   flame retardants with very different potency and contribute to the
   determination of which organophosphate flame retardants are appropriate
   substitutes, as well as the consideration of whether regulations are
   reasonable and required. (C) 2016 SETAC},

Abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) an organophosphate pesticide causes persisting
   behavioral dysfunction in rat models when exposure is during early
   development. In earlier work zebrafish were used as a complementary
   model to study mechanisms of CPF-induced neurotoxicity induced during
   early development. We found that developmental (first five days after
   fertilization) chlorpyrifos exposure significantly impaired learning in
   zebrafish. However, this testing was time and labor intensive. In the
   current study we tested the hypothesis that persisting effects of
   developmental chlorpyrifos could be detected with a brief automated
   assessment of startle response and that this behavioral index could be
   used to help determine the neurobehavioral mechanisms for persisting CPF
   effects. The swimming activity of adult zebrafish was assessed by a
   computerized video-tracking device after a sudden tap to the test arena.
   Ten consecutive trials (1/min) were run to determine startle response
   and its habituation. Additionally, habituation recovery trials were run
   at 8, 32 and 128 min after the end of the initial trial set. CPF-exposed
   fish showed a significantly (p < 0.025) greater overall startle response
   during the 10-trial session compared to controls (group sizes: Control N
   = 40, CPF N = 24). During the initial recovery period (8 min)
   CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.01) greater startle
   response compared to controls. To elucidate the contributions of
   nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to developmental
   CPF-mediated effects, the effects of developmental nicotine and
   pilocarpine exposure throughout the first five days after fertilization
   were determined. Developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure
   significantly increased startle response, though nicotine (group sizes:
   Control N 32, 15 mM N = 12, 25 mM N = 20) was much more potent than
   pilocarpine (group sizes: Control N = 20,100 mu M N = 16,100 mu M N =
   12). Neither was as potent as CPF for developmental exposure increasing
   startle response in adulthood. Lastly. developmental CPF exposure
   decreased dopamine and serotonin levels and increased transmitter
   turnover in developing zebrafish larvae (N = 4 batches of 50
   embryos/treatment). Only the decline in dopamine concentrations
   persisted into adulthood (group sizes: Control N = 14, CPF N = 13). This
   study shows that a quick automated test of startle can detect persisting
   neurobehavioral impairments caused by developmental exposure to CPF This
   may be helpful in screening for persisting neurobehavioral defects from
   a variety of toxicants. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Volume = {46},
Pages = {40-48},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Lead was used extensively as a gas additive and pesticide, in paints,
   batteries, lead shot, pipes, canning and toy manufacturing. Although
   uses of lead have been restricted, lead persists in our environment
   especially in older homes, and generally in soil and water. Although
   extensive studies have determined that fetal and childhood exposures to
   lead have been associated with childhood and adolescent memory
   impairments and learning disabilities, there are limited studies
   investigating early neural and morphological effects that may lead to
   these behavioral and learning abnormalities. Here we utilize the
   zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of lead
   exposure on the brain. We treat embryos with 02 mM lead for 24,48 and 72
   h and analyze neural structures through live imagery and transgenic
   approaches. We find structural abnormalities in the hindbrain region as
   well as changes in branchiomotor neuron development and altered neural
   vasculature. Additionally, we find areas of increased apoptosis. We
   conclude that lead is developmentally neurotoxic to a specific region of
   the brain, the hindbrain and is toxic to branchiomotor neurons residing
   in rhombomeres 2 through 7 of the hindbrain and hindbrain central artery
   vasculature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Phoxim is one of the main organophosphorus pesticides used in
   agricultural production. However, little information is known about how
   it affects the aquatic microbial community and the intestinal microbiota
   of fish. Herein, we utilized shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing to reveal the aquatic eco-risk of phoxim. Seven days of
   phoxim exposure significantly changed the composition of aquatic
   microbial community, obliterated the interactions between
   microorganisms, and thus reduced the complexity and stability of the
   microbial community. During long-time exposure (i.e., 14 days), most of
   the ecological functions were restored due to the redundancy of the
   microbial community. However, phoxim exposure promoted the dissemination
   of elfamycin resistance gene. The zebrafish gut microbial community also
   recovered from a temporary ecological disorder of aquatic microbiota,
   but phoxim continually affected zebrafish growth and swimming behavior.
   Overall, our results demonstrated that phoxim exposure significantly
   changed the structure and function of the microbial community and
   displayed a negative impact on freshwater ecosystems in a short exposure
   time.},

Journal = {TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES},

Number = {1},
Pages = {146-159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Axonal morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity,
   and perturbation of the rate or extent of axonal growth during
   development has been linked to neurobehavioral deficits in animal models
   and humans. We previously demonstrated that the organophosphorus
   pesticide (OP) chlorpyrifos (CPF) inhibits axonal growth in cultured
   neurons. In this study, we used a zebrafish model to determine whether
   CPF, its oxon metabolite (CPFO), or the excreted metabolite
   trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) alter spatiotemporal patterns of axonal
   growth in vivo. Static waterborne exposure to CPFO, but not CPF or TCPy,
   at concentrations >= 0.03 mu M from 24- to 72-h post fertilization
   significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase, and high-performance
   liquid chromatography detected significantly more TCPy in zebrafish
   exposed to 0.1 mu M CPFO versus 1.0 mu M CPF. These data suggest that
   zebrafish lack the metabolic enzymes to activate CPF during these early
   developmental stages. Consistent with this, CPFO, but not CPF,
   significantly inhibited axonal growth of sensory neurons, primary
   motoneurons, and secondary motoneurons at concentrations >= 0.1 mu M.
   Secondary motoneurons were the most sensitive to axonal growth
   inhibition by CPFO, which was observed at concentrations that did not
   cause mortality, gross developmental defects, or aberrant somatic muscle
   differentiation. CPFO effects on axonal growth correlated with adverse
   effects on touch-induced swimming behavior, suggesting the functional
   relevance of these structural changes. These data suggest that altered
   patterns of neuronal connectivity contribute to the developmental
   neurotoxicity of CPF and demonstrate the relevance of zebrafish as a
   model for studying OP developmental neurotoxicity.},

Title = {Prolonged fluoride exposure alters neurotransmission and oxidative
   stress in the zebrafish brain},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {92-98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fluoride is an essential chemical found in dental preparations,
   pesticides and drinking water. Excessive fluoride exposure is related to
   toxicological and neurological disruption. Zebrafish are used in
   translational approaches to understand neurotoxicity in both biomedical
   and environmental areas. However, there is no complete knowledge about
   the cumulative effects of fluoride on neurotransmission systems.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether prolonged
   exposure to sodium fluoride (NaF) alters cholinergic and glutamatergic
   systems and oxidative stress homeostasis in the zebrafish brain. Adult
   zebrafish were used, divided into four experimental groups, one control
   group and three groups exposed to NaF at 30, 50 and 100 mg.L-1 for a
   period of 30 days. After NaF at 30 mg.L-1 exposure, there were
   significant decreases in acetylcholinesterase (29.8 \%) and glutamate
   uptake (39.3 \%). Furthermore, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species were
   decreased at NaF 50 mg.L-1 (32.7 \%), while the group treated with NaF
   at 30 mg.L-1 showed an increase in dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation
   (41.4 \%). NaF at 30 mg.L--(1) decreased both superoxide dismutase (55.3
   \%) and catalase activities (26.1 \%). The inhibitory effect observed on
   cholinergic and glutamatergic signalling mechanisms could contribute to
   the neurodegenerative events promoted by NaF in the zebrafish brain.},

Abstract = {With the spread of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), the
   environmental and health risks they induce are attracting attention.
   Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a popular alternative to brominated flame
   retardant and halogenated OPFRs. Neurodevelopmental toxicity is TPHP's
   primary adverse effect, whereas the biomarkers and the modes of action
   have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg of
   TPHP were orally administered to mice from postnatal day 10 (P10) to
   P70. The behavioral tests showed a compromised learning and memory
   capability. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus exposed to 0.5 or 50
   mg/kg of TPHP identified 531 differentially expressed proteins that were
   mainly involved in axon guidance, synaptic function, neurotransmitter
   transport, exocytosis, and energy metabolism. Immunoblot and
   immunofluorescence analysis showed that exposure to TPHP reduced the
   protein levels of TUBB3 and SYP in the synapses of hippocampal neurons.
   TPHP exposure also downregulated the gene expression of neurotransmitter
   receptors including Grins, Htr1 alpha, and Adra1 alpha in a
   dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, the calcium-dependent synaptic
   exocytosis governed by synaptic vesicle proteins STX1A and SYT1 was
   inhibited in the TPHP-treated hippocampus. Our results reveal that TPHP
   exposure causes abnormal learning and memory behaviors by disturbing
   synaptogenesis and neurotransmission.},

Abstract = {Organophosphate flame retardants are emerging environmental
   contaminants, although knowledge of their health risks is limited. Here,
   thyroid hormone homeostasis and neuronal development was studied in the
   progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)

   100 mu g/L) for 3 months. Increased generation of a reactive oxygen
   species and reduced survival rates was observed in exposed F1 larvae. We
   also observed a significant decrease in plasma thyroxine and
   3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels in F0 females and F1 eggs/larvae. The
   mRNA and protein expression of factors associated with neuronal
   development (e.g., alpha 1-tubulin, myelin basic protein, and synapsin
   ha) were significantly downregulated in exposed F1 larvae, as was the
   level of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, gamma amino butyric
   acid, and histamine. Larval locomotion was significantly decreased in
   exposed fish, but there was no effect on acetylcholinesterase activity.
   Bioconcentration of TDCPP was observed in F0 fish. TDCPP was also
   detected in F1 eggs following parental exposure, indicating maternal
   transfer of this compound. This study uniquely shows that TDCPP can be
   transferred to the offspring of exposed adults, causing thyroid
   endocrine disruption and developmental neurotoxicity.},

   Agent and Pesticide Exposure and Therapeutic Evaluation},
Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Organophosphorus compound exposure remains a present threat through
   agricultural accidents, warfare, or terrorist activity. The primary
   mechanism of organophosphorus toxicity is through inhibition of the
   enzyme acetylcholinesterase, with current emergency treatment including
   anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and oxime reactivators. However, a
   need for more effective and broadly acting countermeasures remains. This
   study aimed to develop larval zebrafish as a high-throughput model for
   evaluating novel therapeutics against acute organophosphorus exposure.
   Larval zebrafish at six days post-fertilization were exposed to acute
   concentrations of seven organophosphorus compounds and treated with one
   of three oximes. Lethality studies indicated similar relative toxicity
   to that seen in the established rodent model, with chemical warfare
   agents proving more lethal than organophosphorus pesticides.
   Additionally, the organophosphorus-specific response for oxime
   reactivation of acetylcholinesterase was comparable to what has been
   previously reported. Behavioral studies measuring the visual motor
   response demonstrated greater efficacy for centrally acting oxime
   compounds than for those that are contained to the peripheral tissue.
   Overall, these results support the use of this larval zebrafish model as
   a high-throughput screening platform for evaluating novel treatments
   following acute organophosphorus exposure.},

Abstract = {In this study, the stereoselective bioactivity, acute toxicity, and
   environmental fate for famoxadone enantiomers were reported for the
   first time. Five representative pathogens (e.g., Alternaria solani) were
   used to investigate enantioselective activity, and three non-target
   organisms (e.g., Selenastrum bibraianum) were used to evaluate acute
   toxicity. S-Famoxadone was 3.00-6.59 times more effective than
   R-famoxadone. R-Famoxadone also showed 1.80-6.40 times more toxicity
   than S-famoxadone toward S. bibraianum and Daphnia magna. The toxicity
   of R-famoxadone was 100 times more toxic than S-famoxadone toward Danio
   rerio. Under aerobic conditions, the half-life (t(1/2)) for famoxadone
   enantiomer degradation was 46.2-126 days in different soils and the
   enantiomeric fraction (EF) ranged from 0.435 to 0.470 after 120 days.
   R-Famoxadone preferentially degraded in three soils, resulting in an
   enrichment of S-famoxadone. Under anaerobic conditions, t(1/2) of
   famoxadone enantiomers was 62.4-147 days in different soils and the EF
   ranged from 0.489 to 0.495, indicating that famoxadone enantiomers were
   not enantioselective. This study will be useful for the environmental
   and health risk assessments for famoxadone enantiomers.},

   development genes was observed in both the male and female brain
   tissues. TDCPP concentrations were measured in adult fish tissues
   including the brain, and greater levels were detected in females. Our
   results showed that females are more sensitive to TDCPP stress than
   males in terms of TDCPP-induced neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that
   long-term exposure to lower concentrations of TDCPP in fish can lead to

Abstract = {As a new protective and therapeutic fungicide, studies on
   famoxadone-cymoxanil are rare, and its toxicity to aquatic organisms has
   not been reported. In the present study, zabrafish embryos were exposed
   to several concentrations of famoxadone-cymoxanil at 10 hpf. Then, the
   changes of their shape, heart rate, development and function of innate
   and adaptive immune cells, oxidative stress, apoptosis, the expression
   of apoptosis-related genes and immune-related genes, the locomotor
   behavior were observed and detected in acute toxicity of
   famoxadone-cymoxanil. Our studies showed that, after exposure to
   famoxadone-cymoxanil, zebrafish embryos had decreased heart rate,
   shortened body length, swollen yolk sac. Secondly, the number of innate
   and adaptive immune cells was significantly reduced; and neutrophil
   migration and retention at the injury area were inhibited, indicating
   the developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity of famoxadone-cymoxanil on
   the zebrafish. We also found that the oxidative stress related
   indicators of embryos were changed significantly, and apoptosis were
   substantially increased. Further investigation of changes of some key
   genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MYD88 and NF-kappa B p65 revealed
   that the mRNA expression of these genes was up-regulated. Meanwhile, the
   mRNA expression of some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha,
   IFN-gamma, IL6 and IL-1 beta was also up-regulated. In addition, the
   activity, the total distance, time and average speed were decreased
   along with the increase of exposure concentration. The absolute turn
   angle, sinuosity and the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) were also increased. These results suggested that
   famoxadone-cymoxanil can induce developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity
   and neurobehavioral toxicity in zebrafish larvae. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Lufenuron is a benzoylurea insecticide that interfere in chitin
   synthesis in insects. Although lufenuron is widely used in agriculture
   and aquaculture, rare are studies described that relates to possible
   toxic effects in fish. This work aimed to evaluate acute and chronic
   toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide (lufenuron) on biological
   parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the acute test,
   juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five
   experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for
   96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four
   months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the
   concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50\% of
   LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in
   eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of
   lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of
   fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and
   blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish
   retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in
   ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis
   and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p >
   0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress
   when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects
   in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui. This concerns about
   the use and discard of lufenuron, and indicates the requirement of
   environmental actions to prevent potential contamination of aquatic
   biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Effluents from ten full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs) that discharge into the Hudson River, surface waters, and
   wild-caught fish samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography with
   tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to examine the influence of
   wastewater discharge on the concentrations of contaminants of emerging
   concern (CFCs) and their ecological impacts on fish. Analysis was based
   on targeted detection of 41 pharmaceuticals, and non-targeted analysis
   (suspect screening) of CEGs. Biological effects of treated WWTP
   effluents were assessed using a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) swimming
   behavior assay. Concentrations of residues in surface waters were
   determined in grab samples and polar organic chemical integrative
   samplers (POCIS). In addition, vitellogenin peptides, used as biomarkers
   of endocrine disruption, were quantified using LC/MS/MS in the
   wild-caught fish plasma samples. Overall, 94 chemical residues were

   carbamazepine (91 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (190 ng/L), citalopram (172
   ng/L), desvenlafaxine (667 ng/L), iopamidol (3790 ng/L), primidone (86
   ng/L), and venlafaxine (231 ng/L). Over 30 chemical residues were
   detected in wild-caught fish tissues. Notably, zebrafish larvae exposed
   to chemical extracts of effluents from 9 of 10 WWTPs, in at least one
   season, were significantly hyperactive. Vitellogenin expression in male
   or immature fish occurred 2.8 times more frequently in fish collected
   from the Hudson River as compared to a reference site receiving no
   direct effluent input. Due to the low concentrations of pharmaceuticals
   detected in effluents, it is likely that chemicals other than
   pharmaceuticals measured are responsible for the behavioral changes
   observed. The combined use of POCIS and non-target analysis demonstrated
   significant increase in the chemical coverage for CEC detection,
   providing a better insight on the impacts of WWTP effluents and
   agricultural practices on surface water quality.},

Title = {Cytotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment, DNA damage and associated
   mechanisms induced by tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate and tris
   (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate in A549 cells},

Abstract = {Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl)
   phosphate (TBOEP), two of the most widely applied phosphorus-containing
   flame retardants (PFRs), have been shown to have adverse effects in
   differ-ent organisms, but their underlying toxicity mechanism remains to
   be elucidated. In the present study, the toxico-logical effects of TDCPP
   and TBOEP on human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and their associated
   mechanisms were investigated at the cellular, organelle and
   transcriptional levels. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay results showed that
   TDCPP and TBOEP reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent
   manner. High-content screening assays showed that both PFRs caused
   mitochondrial impairment at the organelle level, decreasing the
   mitochondrial mem-brane potential and increasing the mitochondrial mass,
   and leading to increased cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage that
   decreased the ratio of cells in S phase and increased the DNA content.
   In addition, oxidative stress was identified as a possible initial
   mechanistic process underlying PFR-induced cytotoxicity and
   mitochondrial im-pairment, as evidenced by intracellular reactive oxygen
   species and mitochondrial superoxide overproduction from environmentally
   relevant concentrations. Furthermore, p53 activation was shown to be
   involved in regulating DNA damage after A549 cell exposure to TDCPP and
   TBOEP. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that TDCPP and TBOEP triggered
   p53/p21-mediated cell cycle arrest pathways, indicating that these PFRs
   can activate p53, and promote as-sociated functional repair. However,
   the p53/bax-mediated apoptosis pathway was not activated following
   exposure to PFRs at specific concentrations. Our results showed that
   TDCPP and TBOEP can cause cytotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment and
   cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage in A549 cells, suggesting that
   oxidative stress is the initial molecular event by which these adverse
   outcomes are induced. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {722},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {In this work, biochar based hydrogel microspheres were fabricated
   successfully to develop pH and ion strength dual-stimuli responsively
   controlled-release system for hydrophilic pesticide. Herein, gentian
   violet (GV) was selected as model hydrophilic pesticide. Taking
   advantage of the cross-linking reaction, GV was incorporated into
   biochar and the 3D network-structured hydrogel, guaranteeing a
   satisfying encapsulation efficiency and sustained release of pesticide.
   The leaching behavior of pesticide in simulated soil column at different
   pHs and ion strength was in accordance with the corresponding release
   performance, and bulk of pesticide was retarded on the surface. In
   addition, the pesticide carrier had nearly no toxic effect on the cell
   proliferation and zebrafish embryo, displaying a good biosafety. The
   work provides a promising strategy with a low-cost and simple procedure
   that could regulate pesticide release behavior, decrease leaching loss,

Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {In vertebrate development, the sequential and rhythmic segmentation of
   the body axis is regulated by a ``segmentation clock{''}. This clock is
   comprised of a population of coordinated oscillating cells that together
   produce rhythmic gene expression patterns in the embryo. Whether
   individual cells autonomously maintain oscillations, or whether
   oscillations depend on signals from neighboring cells is unknown. Using
   a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for the cyclic transcription factor
   Her1, we recorded single tailbud cells in vitro. We demonstrate that
   individual cells can behave as autonomous cellular oscillators. We
   described the observed variability in cell behavior using a theory of
   generic oscillators with correlated noise. Single cells have longer
   periods and lower precision than the tissue, highlighting the role of
   collective processes in the segmentation clock. Our work reveals a
   population of cells from the zebrafish segmentation clock that behave as
   self-sustained, autonomous oscillators with distinctive noisy dynamics.},

Abstract = {Boscalid is a persistent fungicide that is frequently detected in
   surface waters and may be neurotoxic to aquatic organisms. Herein, we
   evaluated the effects of environmentally relevant boscalid
   concentrations to zebrafish to explore its potentially neurotoxic
   mechanisms of effect. Behavioral responses (swimming, phototaxis, and
   predation), histopathology, transcriptomics, biochemical parameter
   analysis and gene expression of larval and adult zebrafish following
   boscalid treatment were assessed. We found that boscalid significantly
   inhibited the locomotor ability and phototactic response of larvae after
   an 8-d exposure, and altered the locomotor activity, predation
   trajectories and ability in adults after a 21-d exposure. It was noted
   that predation rates of zebrafish were significantly decreased by 30\%
   and 100\% after exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L boscalid, respectively.
   Adverse alterations in the cell differentiation of eyes and brain injury
   were also observed in both larvae and adults following boscalid
   exposure. The expression of genes related to neurodevelopment,
   neurotransmission, eye development, and visual function, in conjunction
   with RNA-Seq results, indicated that boscalid may impair visual
   phototransduction and nervous system processes in larval zebrafish.
   Conclusively, boscalid exposure may affect the neurobehavioral response
   of zebrafish by impairing proper visual and nervous system function.},

   embryos},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {307},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fluxapyroxad (Flu), one of the succinate dehydrogenase-inhibited (SDHI)
   fungicides, has been extensively used in crop fungal disease control.
   Despite its increasing use in modern agriculture and long-term retention
   in the environment, the potentially toxic effects of Flu in vivo,
   especially on neurodevelopment, remain under -evaluated. In this study,
   zebrafish embryos were exposed to Flu at concentrations of 0.5, 0.75,
   and 1 mg/L for 96 h to evaluate the neurotoxicity of Flu. The results
   showed that Flu caused concentration-dependent malfor-mations, including
   shorter body length, smaller head and eyes, and yolk sac edema. After
   exposure to Flu, larval zebrafish exhibited severe motor aberrations.
   Flu at a concentration of 1 mg/L significantly decreased dopamine level
   and notably altered acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and
   acetylcholine (ACh) content. Abnormal central nervous system (CNS)
   neurogenesis and disordered motor neuron development were observed in Tg
   (HUC-GFP) and Tg (hb9-GFP) zebrafish in Flu-treated groups. The
   expression of key genes involved in neurotransmission and
   neurodevelopment further proved that Flu impaired the zebrafish nervous
   system. This work contributes to our understanding of the neurotoxic
   effects and mechanisms induced by Flu in zebrafish and may help us take
   precautions against the neurotoxicity of Flu.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the utility of zebra fish as an animal model for
   Parkinson's disease (PD) in comparison with rat model. Materials and
   Methods: MTT assay was performed on rat and zebrafish brain synaptosomal
   fractions using rotenone as a neurotoxic agent. Quercetin and
   resveratrol were used as standards to compare anti-apoptotic activity in
   both organisms. Catalepsy was induced in zebrafish by exposing them to
   haloperidol (9 pM) solution. Drug-treated groups were exposed to
   bromocriptine and pramipexole, 30 min prior to haloperidol exposure at
   the dose of 2, 5, and 10 ptg/mL. Swimming speed, time spent in the
   bottom of the tank, and complete cataleptic time were evaluated to
   assess behavioral changes. In rats, catalepsy was induced using
   haloperidol (1.25 mg/kg i. p.). Drug-treated groups received
   bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg.) and pramipexole (1 mg/kg) orally. Bar test,
   block test, and locomotor activity were carried out to assess behavioral
   changes. Results: Resveratrol and quercetin showed comparable inhibition
   of apoptosis in rats and zebrafish. In anti-cataleptic study,
   bromocriptine and pramipexole-treated groups showed significant
   difference (P < 0.05) in behavioral parameters as compared to
   haloperidol control group in both the experimental organisms. Results
   obtained from fish model were in correlation with rat model. Conclusion:
   Findings of the present study revealed that zebrafish model is highly
   sensitive and can be used for basic screening of drugs against PD.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY \& PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {248},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As a broad-spectrum with low toxicity, procymidone (PCM), is widely used
   in agriculture and frequently observed in aquatic system, which may
   cause some impacts on aquatic organisms. Here, to determine the
   developmental toxicity of PCM, embryonic and larval zebrafish were
   exposed to PCM at 0, 1, 10, 100 mu g/L in dehydrogenated natural water
   containing 0.01\% acetone for 7 days. The results showed that high
   concentration of PCM could cause the pericardial edema and increase the
   heart rates in larval zebrafish, suggesting that PCM had developmental
   toxicity to zebrafish. We also observed that PCM exposure not only
   changed the physiological parameters including TBA, GLU and pyruvic
   acid, but also changed the transcriptional levels of glycolipid
   metabolism related genes. In addition, after transcriptomics analysis, a
   total of 1065 differentially expressed genes, including 456 up-regulated
   genes and 609 down-regulated genes, changed significantly in 100 mu g/L
   PCM treated larval zebrafish. Interestingly, after GO (Gene Ontology)
   analysis, the different expression genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched to
   the three different biology processes including GABA-nervous, lipid
   Metabolism and response to drug. We also observed that the levels of
   GABA receptor related genes including gabrg2, gabbr1 alpha, gabbr1 and
   gabra6 alpha were inhibited by PCM exposure. Interestingly, the swimming
   distance of larval zebrafish had the tendency to decrease after PCM
   exposure, indicating that the nervous system was affected by PCM. Taken
   together, the results confirmed that the fungicide PCM could cause
   developmental toxicity by influencing the lipid metabolism and GABA
   mediated nervous system and behavior in larval zebrafish. We believed
   that the results could provide an important data for the influence of
   PCM on aquatic animals.},

Abstract = {The BehavioQuant(R) system will be introduced which uses the integrative
   whole-organism response by automatized recording and quantifying the
   spontaneous behaviour of fish and other test organisms. While moving
   unrestricted within the test chamber, the movements of each single fish
   are recorded by video imaging, and their traces are digitized
   numerically by x-/y-coordinates. From the object traces several test
   parameters are calculated which give information about behavioural
   changes of the observed fishes. These various parameters are: the
   average swimming velocity (motility), the average swimming depth below
   surface, the inconstancy of motility, the frequency of turns, the
   standard frequency distributions of vertical and horizontal positions
   (can be used for quantification of a preference for dark or light
   habitats), and the distance behaviour. A continuously monitoring of up
   to 16 aquaria is possible. The statistic comparison between treated
   groups and control groups is done for each test parameter separately.
   The automatical evaluation of the continuous observation of surface
   waters results from a comparison of the actual behaviour data to the
   data of a reference period. Some examples for the applications of the
   BehavioQuant(R) system will be demonstrated (effects of atrazine), and
   their results will be discussed.
   Behavioural changes of a single species can finally cause changes in
   biocenotic structures and functions. Therefore, it is necessary to
   include the results of quantitative behaviour measurements in
   ecotoxicological hazard assessment.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Carbendazim is a widely used broad spectrum benzimidazole fungicide;
   however, its effects to non-target aquatic organisms are poorly studied.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the toxic effects of
   carbendazim to zebrafish early life stages at several levels of
   biological organization, including developmental, biochemical and
   behavioural levels. The embryo assay was done following the OECD
   guideline 236 and using a concentration range between 1.1 and 1.8 mg/L.
   Lethal and developmental endpoints such as hatching, edemas,
   malformations, heart beat rate, body growth and delays were assessed in
   a 96 h exposure. A sub-teratogenic range (from 0.16 to 500 mu g/L) was
   then used to assess effects at biochemical and behavioural levels.
   Biochemical markers included cholinesterase (ChE),
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
   catalase (CAT) and were assessed at 96 h. The locomotor behaviour was
   assessed using an automated video tracking system at 120 h.
   Carbendazim (96 h-LC50 of 1.75 mg/L) elicited several developmental
   anomalies in zebrafish embryos with EC50 values ranging from 0.85 to 1.6
   mg/L. ChE, GST and LDH activities were increased at concentrations equal
   or above 4 mu g/L. The locomotor assay showed to be extremely sensitive,
   detecting effects in time that larvae spent swimming at concentrations
   of 0.16 a and thus, being several orders of magnitude more sensitive
   that developmental parameters or lethality. These are ecological
   relevant concentrations and highlight the potential of behavioural
   endpoints as early warning signs for environmental stress. Further
   studies should focus on understanding how the behavioural disturbances
   measured in these types of studies translate into fitness impairment at
   the adult stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Methoxyfenozide is widely employed in paddy land and can flow out into
   the aquatic environment. The present study combines two approaches,
   namely, an aquatic microcosm simulation experiment and a multimedia
   fugacity model, to study the fate and distribution of methoxyfenozide in
   an aquatic microcosm containing water, sediment, aquatic plants, and
   zebrafish. The model results indicated that the simulated concentrations
   agreed with the observed values within one order of magnitude. The
   degradation rate was less than 7.0\% in the three types of aquatic
   microcosms at 740 h in the model. Methoxyfenozide exhibited very high
   persistence in the aquatic microcosm. Water played a key role in the
   fate of methoxyfenozide, acting as a sink in the simulated aquatic
   environment, followed by sediment. Only approximately 2\% of
   methoxyfenozide entered the organisms (zebrafish and Egeria densa
   Planch). Methoxyfenozide underwent a significant transport process
   between the water and sediment. The applications of multimedia fugacity
   models are useful for understanding the behaviors, fate, and transport
   of pesticides after their release into the environment and to facilitate
   risk assessment and management activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Nanotechnology-based pesticide formulations can improve the utilization
   rate of pesticides and reduce their negative effects on the environment.
   In this work, prochloraz was encapsulated within the pores of mesoporous
   silica nanoparticles (MSNs) attached covalently chitosan on the surface
   as gatekeepers via a silane coupling agent to prepare
   MSNs-chitosan@prochloraz nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that
   the obtained nanoparticles had a relatively high loading efficiency of
   prochloraz (25.4\% w/w) and enhanced the light stability of prochloraz
   effectively. The nanoparticles showed excellent esterase and pH
   dual-responsive properties with controlled release behavior. The
   biological activity survey confirmed that the acid and enzyme produced
   by infected fruit can easily open the ``gate{''} guarded by chitosan to
   achieve esterase and pH triggered on-demand pesticide release. Compared
   with prochloraz emulsifiable concentrate, preharvest application of
   MSNs-chitosan@prochloraz possessed a longer duration and a better
   antifungal activity against citrus diseases. The toxicity of the
   nanoparticles to zebrafish was reduced more than 6-fold compared with
   that of prochloraz technical. These results demonstrated that the
   MSNs-chitosan@prochloraz nanoparticles had potential as an
   environmentally friendly preharvest treatment agent in agricultural
   application.},

Abstract = {Ethyl carbamate (EC, urethane). which is used as an anesthetic
   especially by veterinarians due to its very long duration of action, is
   also a naturally occurring compound in all fermented foods and
   beverages. Although the health problem of EC is related to its
   carcinogenic potential, the scarcity of current studies that can be used
   in the evaluation of usage limits encouraged us to do this study. In
   this context, zebra fish embryos were exposed to serial doses of EC.
   According to the results, it was observed that CC exposure caused a
   significant decrease in survival and hatching rates as well as
   significant body malformations. Whole-mount staining results showed that
   CC caused dose-dependent increased apoptosis. Oxidative stress caused by
   EC exposure was demonstrated by whole-mount staining, transcriptional
   and immunohistochemically. Furthermore, it has been shown
   histochemically that CC exposure causes necrosis and degeneration in the
   brain. In behavioral tests, it was observed that CC caused hyperactivity
   associated with these neuronal degenerations. In addition, a dramatic
   decrease in blood flow was detected in association with pericardial
   edema. In the light of the current results, it should be carefully
   considered that EC can be found naturally in many human diets,
   especially fermented foods. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Review on Environmental Contaminants-Related Fertility Threat in Male
   Fishes: Effects and Possible Mechanisms of Action Learned from Wildlife
   and Laboratory Studies},

Abstract = {Simple Summary:Public concern regarding environmental contaminants
   (ECs)-related reproductivedisorders has increased due to increasing
   global rates of infertility. All kinds of ECs are on riserapidly in
   developing and industrializing low- and middle-income countries. The
   aquatic envi-ronments throughout the world are repositories for enormous
   amounts of ECs. As the biology ofthe reproductive system is highly
   conserved in vertebrates, wildlife or laboratory studies on fishprovide
   significant information to establish a detailed risk assessment, and to
   identify novel or moresensitive endpoints for ECs-related reproductive
   disorders. The adverse effects of ECs on endocrineregulation of
   reproduction in male fishes have been extensively studied and reviewed;
   however,our knowledge on the effects and mechanisms of action of ECs on
   determinants of male fertility islimited. The present study is a
   state-of-the-art comprehensive review on the ECs-related fertilitythreat
   in male fishes with emphasis on the ECs effects on sperm production,
   morphology, genome,and motility kinetics. After a brief introduction to
   reproductive biology, fertility indicators, anddeterminants of fertility
   in male fishes, wildlife evidences for reproductive disorders were
   reviewedin fishes from the polluted aquatic environment. The laboratory
   studies show that ECs detected inaquatic environment are capable of
   causing fertility threat at environmentally relevant
   concentrationsassociated with a decrease in fertility determinant(s).
   This study suggests an urgent need to betterelucidate mechanisms through
   which ECs affect sperm functions to cause fertility
   threat.Abstract:Increasing global rates of diminished fertility in males
   has been suggested to be associatedwith exposure to environmental
   contaminants (ECs). The aquatic environments are the final reposi-tory
   of ECs. As the reproductive system is conserved in vertebrates, studies
   on the effects of ECson fertility endpoints in fishes provide us with
   valuable information to establish biomarkers in riskassessment of ECs,
   and to understand the ECs-related fertility threat. The aim of the
   present reviewwas to evaluate associations between ECs and fertility
   determinants to better understand ECs-relatedmale fertility threat in
   male fishes. Wildlife studies show that the reproductive system has
   beenaffected in fishes sampled from the polluted aquatic environment.
   The laboratory studies show thepotency of ECs including natural and
   synthetic hormones, alkylphenols, bisphenols, plasticizers,pesticides,
   pharmaceutical, alkylating, and organotin agents to affect fertility
   determinants, resultingin diminished fertility at environmentally
   relevant concentrations. Both wildlife and laboratorystudies reveal that
   ECs adverse effects on male fertility are associated with a decrease in
   spermproduction, damage to sperm morphology, alternations in sperm
   genome, and decrease in spermmotility kinetics. The efficiency of ECs to
   affect sperm quality and male fertility highly dependson the
   concentration of the contaminants and the duration of exposure. Our
   review highlighs \& nbsp;that the number of contaminants examined over
   fertility tests are much lower than the number ofcontaminants detected
   in our environment. The ECs effects on fertility are largely unknown
   whenfishes are exposed to the contaminants at early developmental
   stages. The review suggests the urgentneed to examine ECs effects on
   male fertility when a fish is exposed at different developmental
   stagesin a single or combination protocol.
   The ECs effects on the sperm genome are largely unknownto understand
   ECs-related inheritance of reproductive disorders transmitted to the
   progeny. Toelucidate modes of action of ECs on sperm motility, it is
   needed to study functional morphology ofthe motility apparatus and to
   investigate ECs-disrupted motility signaling.</p>},

Title = {Short-term and persistent impacts on behaviors related to locomotion,

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although most exposures to chlorpyrifos (CPF) in natural flowing waters
   are brief and episodic, there have been a few reports of the persistence
   of abnormal fish behaviors caused by such acute exposure. The present
   study focused on the behavioral and biochemical responses of Japanese
   medaka (Oryzias latipes) to acute, sublethal exposure to CPF, as well as
   the persistence of the effects during a 3-week recovery test in CPF-free
   water. The medaka became hyperactive and exhibited an elevated anxiety
   state after a 4-day exposure to 0.024 mg/L of CPF, but they recovered
   from these abnormal behavioral responses within 7 days of recovery
   treatment. In contrast, persistent impacts on some startle responses to
   a sudden stimulation (induced by a ball drop) were observed in medaka
   exposed to CPF. The reaction latency did not change immediately after
   the 4-day exposure, but was significantly prolonged by as much as 21
   days after the termination of exposure. The post-stimulus swimming
   distance within 5 s significantly decreased on the day immediately after
   the 4-day exposure, but it significantly increased after 7 days of
   recovery treatment. The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the
   brains of medaka was significantly inhibited on the day immediately
   after the 4-day exposure, but it returned to 80\% and 110\% of that in
   control fish on days 7 and 21 of the recovery period, respectively.
   However, AChE activities in the eyes of exposed medaka were persistently
   inhibited and declined to 33\%, 71\%, and 72\% of that in control fish
   on days 0 (immediately after the 4-day exposure), 7, and 21 of recovery,
   respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that the changes of AChE
   activities in the brains of medaka may underlie some of the observed
   acute behavioral changes, and the changes of AChE activities in the eyes
   may contribute to the persistence of the abnormalities in the reaction
   latency of the startle response. Our findings suggest that medaka need a
   long time to recover from acute, sublethal exposure to CPF, and the
   persistence of the behavioral abnormalities might affect their fitness
   in natural habitats.},

   Neurodevelopmental Defects in Embryonic Zebrafish Exposed to

Volume = {145},

Abstract = {The increased use of flammable plastics and electronic devices along
   with stricter fire safety standards has led to the heavy use of flame
   retardant chemicals in many consumer, commercial, and industrial
   products. Although flame retardant use has increased, a great deal of
   uncertainty surrounds their safety with some evidence showing toxicity
   and risk to human and environmental health. Recent efforts have focused
   on designing high-throughput biological platforms with nonmammalian
   models to evaluate and prioritize chemicals with limited hazard
   information. To complement these efforts, this study used a new
   morphological and behavioral testing platform with embryonic zebrafish
   to characterize the developmental toxicity of 44 halogenated and
   organophosphate flame retardants, including several of their known
   metabolites. Zebrafish were exposed to flame retardants from 6 to 120 h
   post fertilization (hpf) across concentrations spanning 4 orders of
   magnitude (eg, 6.4 nM to 64 A mu M). Flame retardant effects on survival
   and development were evaluated at 24 and 120 hpf, and neurobehavioral
   changes were measured using 2 photomotor response (PMR) assays. Compared
   to controls, 93\% (41/44) of flame retardants studied elicited adverse
   effects among one or more of the bioassays and concentrations tested
   with the aryl phosphate ester (APE)-based mono-isopropylated triaryl
   phosphate and the brominated-bisphenol-A analog tetrabromobisphenol-A
   producing the greatest array of malformations. Hierarchical clustering
   showed that APE flame retardants with isopropyl, butyl, and cresyl
   substituents on phenyl rings clustered tightly and were particularly
   potent. Both PMR assays were highly predictive of morphological defects
   supporting their use as nonlethal means of evaluating teratogenicity
   that could allow for additional evaluations of long-term or delayed
   effects in older animals. Taken together, evidence presented here
   indicates that zebrafish neurodevelopment is highly sensitive to many
   flame retardants currently in use and can be used to understand
   potential vulnerabilities to human health.},

   and TEA + DHM treated groups for both test parameters the presence of
   DHM increased the toxic effect of TEA on zebrafish for the preference
   and decreased for the motility. The main result is that the preference
   follows an additive principle, but not the motiliy. Hints for the

Abstract = {Oxine-copper (OxCu) is generally used as an agricultural pesticide and
   induces harmful effects on ecosystems. In this study, zebrafish was used
   to assess the aquatic toxicity of OxCu. To detect the effects on
   development, embryos of 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10
   mu g/L, 20 mu g/L, 40 mu g/L OxCu for 18 h; meanwhile, to evaluate the
   effects on the behavior, larval fish at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf)
   were exposed to the same concentrations for 24 h. Here, we show that
   there are embryonic developmental defects, including abnormalities of
   head and trunk, brain ventricle atrophy, reduced newborn neurons,
   disordered neurons, increased intercellular space, concentrated
   cytoplasm, decreased heart beat and blood flow velocity, and
   developmental delay of the vascular system; in addition, some embryos
   exposed to the high concentration of OxCu degraded from the tail. We
   also found that the spontaneous tail coiling frequency and AChE enzyme
   activity were reduced, while oxidative stress (free radical damage) and
   cell apoptosis were significantly increased. Moreover, the expression of
   genes involved in neurodevelopment, vascular development and apoptosis
   were dysregulated in the OxCu exposed embryos in a
   concentration-dependent manner. Finally, we found that after exposure to
   OxCu, larval locomotor activity was decreased and accompanied by
   Parkinson-like (increased absolute turn angle and sinuosity) and
   anxiety-like (preferred to the central area) behavior. These results
   indicate that OxCu induces developmental toxicity and behavioral
   alterations by affecting AChE enzyme activity and oxidative stress. Our
   data present new proofs of OxCu toxicity and a warning for its
   application.},

   toxicity of graphene oxide and triphenyl phosphate},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {263},
Number = {A},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The increasing production and applications of graphene oxide (GO, a
   novel carbon nanomaterial) have raised numerous environmental concerns
   regarding its ecological risks. Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) disperses in
   water and poses an increasing hazard to the ecosystem and human health.
   It is critical to study the environmental responses and molecular
   mechanisms of GO and TPhP together to assess both chemicals; however,
   this information is lacking. The present work revealed that GO promoted
   the bioaccumulation of TPhP in zebrafish larvae by 5.0\%e24.3\%. The
   TPhP-induced growth inhibition of embryos (malformation, mortality,
   heartbeat, and spontaneous movement) at environmentally relevant
   concentrations was significantly amplified by GO, and these results were
   supported by the downregulated levels of genes and proteins associated
   with cytoskeletal construction and cartilage and eye development. TPhP
   induced negligible alterations in the genes or proteins involved in
   oxidative stress and apoptosis, but those related proteins were all
   upregulated by GO. GO and TPhP coexposure activated the mTOR signaling
   pathway and subsequently promoted apoptosis in zebrafish by potentiating
   the oxidative stress induced by TPhP, presenting synergistic toxicity.
   These findings highlight the potential risks and specific molecular
   mechanisms of combining emerging carbon nanomaterials with coexisting
   organic contaminants. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The mechanism for initiating DNA cleavage by DDE-family enzymes,
   including the RAG endonuclease, which initiates V(D)J recombination, is
   not well understood. Here we report six cryo-EM structures of zebrafish
   RAG in complex with one or two intact recombination signal sequences
   (RSSs), at up to 3.9-angstrom resolution. Unexpectedly, these structures
   reveal DNA melting at the heptamer of the RSSs, thus resulting in a
   corkscrew-like rotation of coding-flank DNA and the positioning of the
   scissile phosphate in the active site. Substrate binding is associated
   with dimer opening and a piston-like movement in RAG1, first outward to
   accommodate unmelted DNA and then inward to wedge melted DNA. These
   precleavage complexes show limited base-specific contacts of RAG at the
   conserved terminal CAC/GTG sequence of the heptamer, thus suggesting
   conservation based on a propensity to unwind. CA and TG overwhelmingly
   dominate terminal sequences in transposons and retrotransposons, thereby
   implicating a universal mechanism for DNA melting during the initiation
   of retroviral integration and DNA transposition.},

   whether the promotion effect of TDCIPP still exists in male HCC model
   zebrafish remains unclear. In this study, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2;
   TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12v)), referred as kras transgenic zebrafish which was
   shown to be an inducible liver tumor model, was applied as experimental
   model to assess the promotion potential of TDCIPP for HCC in males. In
   brief, kras males were exposed to 20 mg/L doxycycline (DOX), 0.3 mg/L
   TDCIPP and a binary mixture of 20 mg/L DOX with 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, and
   after exposure liver size, histopathology and transcriptional profiles
   of liver from these treatments were examined. With the involvement of
   TDCIPP, the liver size was significantly increased and the lesion of
   hepatocyte became more aggressive. Furthermore, expressions of genes
   involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were
   simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the
   solvent control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two
   chemicals compared to the single DOX treatment. Overall, our results
   suggested that TDCIPP had promotion effect on the progression of liver
   tumor in kras males.},

Title = {Clethodim exposure induced development toxicity and behaviour alteration
   in early stages of zebrafish life},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {255},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture,
   however, its potential toxic effects on organisms and the underlying
   toxicity mechanism are still poorly understood. In this study, zebrafish
   embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 mg/L, 20
   mg/L, and 30 mg/L clethodim for up to 24 hpf, and zebrafish larvae at 6
   days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to the same density gradient
   for 24 h. Our results showed that clethodim could cause head and
   cardiovascular malformations in embryos: blurred brain ventricles,
   unapparent brain regions, condensation of nucleus and cytoplasm in brain
   cells, increased intercellular space, developmental malformations of
   eyes and ears, reduced neonatal neurons, disorder migration of neural
   ridge cells; morphological aberrations of the vascular ICM, slowing of
   heart beat and blood flow, reduction of circulating red blood cells, and
   delayed development of head and tail blood vessels. These defects could
   be a result of clethodim-induced oxidative stress and decreased
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which in turn affected the
   expression of neurodevelopmental genes, decreased ATPase activity, and
   ultimately led to developmental malformations. The swimming behaviour of
   zebrafish larvae was observed to decrease with increasing concentration
   of clethodim exposure, but the angular velocity and mobility increased.
   These could be due to reduced AChE activity and disturbed gene
   expression of GABA, dopamine and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems,
   which thus altered the locomotor behaviour. In summary, we found that
   clethodim induces developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish
   embryos and larvae. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Interference of endocrine disrupting chemicals with aromatase CYP19
   expression or activity, and consequences for reproduction of teleost
   fish},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {155},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-62},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Many natural and synthetic compounds present in the environment exert a
   number of adverse effects on the exposed organisms, leading to endocrine
   disruption, for which they were termed endocrine disrupting chemicals
   (EDCs). A decrease in reproduction success is one of the most
   well-documented signs of endocrine disruption in fish. Estrogens are
   steroid hormones involved in the control of important
   reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation,
   maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance
   of estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final
   step of estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the
   cyp19 gene, converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase
   CYP19 expression and function can dramatically alter the rate of
   estrogen production, disturbing the local and systemic levels of
   estrogens. In the present review, the current progress in CYP19
   characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the potential of
   several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and activity
   is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and
   cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both
   aromatase CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and
   regulation of the reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in
   diverse teleost species. Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or
   activity, be it upregulation or downregulation, may lead to diverse
   disturbances of the above mentioned processes. Prediction of multiple
   transcriptional regulatory elements in the promoters of teleost cyp19
   genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes to affect cyp19
   expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP
   responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein
   site, an estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive
   elements, and elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors
   (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, retinoid X receptor,
   retinoic acid receptor). Certain compounds including phytoestrogens,
   xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may modulate aromatase CYP19
   activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown in this review,
   diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of aromatase
   cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further
   characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a
   contaminated environment to teleost fish population. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {Aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist diuron and its metabolites cause
   reproductive disorders in male marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {305},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Diuron, a widely used phenylurea herbicide, has been frequently detected
   in marine organism and seawater all over the world. But the
   understanding of potential damage of diuron on reproduction in marine
   fish is currently not enough. Herein, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)
   were continuously exposed to 0, 5, 50, 500, and 5000 ng/L diuron from
   embryo (0 dpf) to adult (180 dpf) stage. The results suggested that
   diuron had an adverse influence on male reproduction for marine medaka,
   including decreased gonado somatic index, histological changes of
   testes, decreased mobility of sperm, and reduced fecundity through
   disrupting the balance of sex hormone and genes expression related to
   hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadalliver (HPGL) axis. The reduced fecundity
   was reflected in abnormal sexual behaviors, further inhibited growth and
   development of F1 embryo and larvae. Moreover, the proportion of diuron
   metabolites (DCPMU and DCPU) was increased in fish, but the proportion
   of diuron was decreased with the increasing of exposure concentration.
   Diuron, DCPMU, and DCPU was identified as aryl hydrocarbon receptor
   agonist (AhR) agonist using in silico and in vivo models. DCPMU and DCPU
   induced the gene expression of AhR signaling and metabolizing enzymes
   (such as cyp1a1) in the livers. A great deal of major metabolites
   affected various organs related to HPGL axis of male marine medaka and
   led to serious reproductive disorders. Consequently, it reveals that
   long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron
   and even AhR agonist pesticides pose a potential ecological risk for
   marine fish.},

Title = {Halloysite nanotubes-based composite material with acid/alkali dual pH
   response and foliar adhesion for smart delivery of hydrophobic pesticide},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {451},
Number = {4},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Smart pesticide delivery systems with pH response are arousing huge
   interests recently, but single pH sensitivity may bring about constraint
   in different agricultural situations. We have developed a novel type of
   responsive material with acid/alkali dual pH sensitivity to deliver
   hydrophobic pesticide by the combination of acid-sensitive calcium ion
   (Ca2+)-ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA(2-)) complex and
   base-sensitive calcium alginate. During the loading of chlorpyrifos,
   assembly occurs spontaneously by mixing Ca2+-modified acid-treated
   halloysite nanotubes (a-HNTs) with EDTA(2-), followed by the
   functionalization of alginate gel to obtain the foliar-adhesive
   pesticide, namely HCECA (each letter representing halloysite, Ca2+,
   EDTA(2-), chlorpyrifos and alginate, respectively). With loading
   capacity and loading efficiency of chlorpyrifos at 130 mg/g and 65 \%,
   this engineered pesticide exhibits characteristic sustained release
   behavior of chlorpyrifos with dual pH response, displaying the release
   ratio of 58 \% and 83 \% in 24 h at pH = 4.0 and pH = 8.5, respectively,
   which is further demonstrated by prolonged control efficiency of corn
   borers. Owing to the strong interaction of alginate with plant leaves,
   the foliar adhesion property of HCECA against rain rinsing was
   strengthened by 86 \% and 45 \%, in comparison to pristine chlorpyrifos
   and HCEC (the control pesticide without alginate). The stability of
   HCECA was investigated, showing its resistance to high temperature (50
   C) and ultraviolet irradiation. Notably, the carrier material shows
   excellent biocompatibility by testing toxicity on zebrafish. Featured by
   green preparation, acid/alkali dual pH response and multifaceted
   stability, the halloysite nanotubes-based gel material serves as a
   promising carrier for hydrophobic pesticide to be applied in controlled
   management of agricultural hazards.},

Abstract = {Dithiocarbamates form a large group of chemicals that have numerous uses
   in agriculture and medicine. It has been reported that dithiocarbamates,
   including thiuram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), cause wavy distortions
   of the notochord in zebrafish and other fish embryos. In the present
   study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the toxicity of thiuram
   in zebrafish embryos. When embryos were exposed to thiuram (2-1000 nM:
   0.48-240 mu g/L) from 3 h post fertilization (hpf) (30\% epiboly) until
   24 hpf (Prim-5), all embryos develop wavy notochords, disorganized
   somites, and have shortened yolk sac extensions. The thiurarn response
   was specific and did not cause growth retardation or mortality at 24
   hpf. The thiuram-dependent responses showed the same concentration
   dependence with a waterborne EC50 values of approximately 7 nM.
   Morphometric measurements revealed that thiuram does not affect the rate
   of notochord lengthening. However, the rate of overall body lengthening
   was significantly reduced in thiuram-ex posed animals. Other
   dithiocarbamates, such as ziram, caused similar malformations to
   thiuram. While expression of genes involved in sornitogenesis was not
   affected, the levels of notochord-specific transcripts were altered
   after the onset of malformations. Distortion of the notochord started
   precisely at 18 hpf, which is concomitant with onset of spontaneous
   rhythmic trunk contractions. Abolishment of spontaneous contractions
   using tricaine, a-bungarotoxin, and a paralytic mutant sofa potato,
   resulted in normal notochord morphology in the presence of thiuram.
   These results indicate that muscle activity is necessary to reveal the
   underlying functional deficit and suggest that the developmental target
   of dithiocarbamates impairs trunk plasticity through an unknown
   mechanism. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Toxic effects of fluridone on early developmental stages of Japanese
   Medaka (Oryzias latipes)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {700},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The herbicide fluridone is intensively applied to control invasive
   aquatic plants globally, including in the Sacramento and San Joaquin
   Delta (the Delta), California, USA. Our previous study revealed that the
   adult stage of Delta Smelt showed acute and sub-lethal adverse effects
   following 6 h of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of
   fluridone. To further investigate mechanisms of toxicity of fluridone
   and to assess its toxicity to early life stages of fish, we performed
   additional exposures using the fish model Japanese Medaka (Oryzias
   latipes). Male and female Medaka embryos were exposed to concentrations
   of fluridone for 14 d and showed reduced hatching success in a dose
   dependent manner. The half maximal effective concentration for the
   hatching success was 2.3 mg L-1. In addition, male and female Medaka
   larvae were acute exposed to fluridone for 6 h to assess their swimming
   behavior and gene expression patterns. Fish exposed to fluridone at 4.2
   mg L-1 or higher became lethargic and showed abnormal swimming behavior.
   The response to the stimuli was significantly impaired by fluridone at
   21 mg L-1 and above in males, and at 104 mg L-1 in females.
   Transcriptome analysis identified a total of 799 genes that were
   significantly differentially expressed, comprising 555 up-regulated and
   244 down-regulated genes in males exposed to 21 mg L-1 of fluridone. The
   gene set enrichment analysis indicated a number of biological processes
   altered by fluridone. Among the genes involved in those biological
   processes, the expression of the genes, acetylcholinesterase, retinoic
   acid receptor, insulin receptor substrate, glutathione reductase, and
   glutathione S transferase, exhibited dose- and sex-dependent responses
   to fluridone. The study indicated that fluridone exposure led to
   detrimental toxic effects at early developmental stages of fish, by
   disturbing the biological processes of growth and development, and the
   nervous system, inducing oxidative stress and endocrine disruption. (C)

Abstract = {Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) has been detected in
   various environmental media and has been implicated as a weak mutagen or
   carcinogen, but whether TDCIPP can promote the progression of liver
   tumor remains unclear. In this study, kras(V12) genetically modified
   zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12V)), a model system in
   which liver tumors can be induced by doxycycline (DOX), was used to
   evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of TDCIPP. Briefly,
   kras(V12) transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, 20 mg/L
   DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver
   size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were
   determined. Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and
   caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the
   exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the
   expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like
   receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of
   inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount
   of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic
   zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent
   protein under the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the
   binary exposure of DOX and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of
   TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory response inhibitor (ketoprofen)
   significantly decrease the liver size and the amounts of neutrophils in
   the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish larvae.
   Collectively, our results suggested that TDCIPP could promote the liver
   tumor progression by induction of hepatic inflammatory responses. (C)

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {99},
Number = {2},
Pages = {275-280},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Despite growing evidence of the detrimental effect of chemical
   substances on organisms, limited research has focused on changes in
   behavioral patterns, in part due to the difficulties to obtain detailed
   quantitative data. Recent developments in efficient computer-based video
   analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as
   the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied
   to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess
   toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking
   analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant
   on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into
   account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated
   effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used
   sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4
   concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior
   at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h
   video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on
   behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time.
   Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt
   concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison
   with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have
   detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition
   and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of
   the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of
   examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the
   complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly,
   pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the
   need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these
   patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Parkinson's Disease (PD) exhibits the extrapyramidal
   symptoms caused due to the dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the
   substantia nigra of the brain and depletion of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase
   (ALDH) enzyme. Objective: This study was designed to enlighten the
   importance of the Aldehyde dehydrogenase en-zyme in protecting the
   dopamine levels in a living system. Camalexin, a potentially active
   com-pound, has been evaluated for its dopamine enhancing and aldehyde
   dehydrogenase protecting role in pesticide-induced Parkinson's disease.
   Methods: AutoDock 4.2 software was employed to perform the docking
   simulations between the li-gand camalexin and standard drugs Alda-1,
   Ropirinole with three proteins 4WJR, 3INL, 5AER. Consequently, the
   compound was evaluated for its in vivo neuroprotective role in the
   zebrafish model by attaining Institutional Animal Ethical Committee
   permission. The behavioral assess-ments and catecholamine analysis in
   zebrafish were performed. Results: The Autodock result shows that the
   ligand camalexin has a lower binding energy (-3.84) that indicates a
   higher affinity with the proteins when compared to the standard drug of
   proteins (-3.42). In the zebrafish model, behavioral studies provided
   evidence that camalexin helps in the improvement of motor functions and
   cognition. The catecholamine assay has proved that there is an
   enhancement in dopamine levels, as well as an improvement in aldehyde
   dehydrogenase en-zyme. Conclusion: The novel compound, camalexin, offers
   a protective role in Parkinson's disease mod-el by its interaction with
   neurochemical proteins and also in alternative in vivo model.},

Abstract = {This study elucidated the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos on the early
   life stages of banded gourami (Trichogaster fasciata). To determine the
   acute effects of chlorpyrifos on their survival and development, we
   exposedthe embryos and two-day-old larvae to six concentrations (0,
   0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10 and 100 mu g L-1) of chlorpyrifos in plastic bowls.
   Log-logistic regression was used to calculate LC10 and LC50 values.
   Results showed that embryo mortality significantly increased with

   (with 95\% confidence limits) of chlorpyrifos for embryos were 0.89
   (0.50-1.58) and 11.8 (9.12-15.4)mu g L-1, respectively. Hatching success
   decreased and mortality of larvae significantly increased with

   and LC50 for larvae were 0.04 (0.02-0.09) and 5.47 (3.77-7.94)mu g L-1,
   respectively. The results of this study suggest that 1 mu g L-1 of
   chlorpyrifos in the aquatic environment may adversely affect the
   development and the reproduction of banded gourami. Our study also
   suggests that banded gourami fish can serve as an ideal model species
   for evaluating developmental toxicity of environmental contaminants.},

Abstract = {Sodium fluoride (NaF), used as pesticides and for industrial purposes
   are deposited in the water bodies and therefore affects its biota.
   Zebrafish exposed to NaF in laboratory condition showed hyperactivity
   and frequent surfacing activity, somersaulting and vertical swimming
   pattern as compared to the control group. Reactive oxygen species level
   was elevated and glutathione level was depleted along with increased
   malondialdehyde content in the brain. Levels of
   glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase
   were also elevated in the treatment groups. Expression of mRNA of
   nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its inhibitor
   Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) during stress condition were
   observed along with Gst, Cat, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1(Nqo1) and
   p38. Except Keap1, all other genes exhibited elevated expression.
   Nrf2/Keap1 proteins had similar expression pattern as their
   corresponding mRNA. The findings in this study might help to understand
   the molecular mechanism of fluoride induced neurotoxicity in fish. (C)

Title = {Comprehensive evaluation of chiral pydiflumetofen from the perspective
   of reducing environmental risks},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {826},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The spatial structures of chiral pesticide enantiomers can affect their
   activity, toxicity and behavior, thereby altering exposure risk.
   Identifying enantiomer differences and developing high-efficiency green
   enantiopure pesticide is an important strategy for reducing the negative
   effects of pesticides. In this study, after confirming the absolute
   configuration of pydiflumetofen enantiomers, fungicidal activity
   evaluation indicated that the activity of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen was
   81.3-421 times higher than R-(-)-pydiflumetofen on three kinds of
   phytopathogens that control Fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), Alternaria
   rot (Alternaria alternata) and Southern blight (Sclerotinia rolfsii),
   which might be caused by the stronger binding ability of
   S-(+)-pydiflumetofen with the active site of the target protein. The
   coexistence of R-(-)-pydiflumetofen would enhance the toxicity of
   S-(+)-pydiflumetofen on zebrafish through synergistic effect.
   Low-activity R-(-)-pydiflumetofen was preferentially dissipated in
   soybean, soybean plants, cabbage and celery, which was opposite in soil.
   The persistence of S-(+)-pydiflumetofen in crops and degradability in
   soil were advantageous for pesticide effects and environmental
   protection. Based on the maximum residue limit (MRL) and hazard quotient
   (HQ), the dietary risks were determined to be acceptable for all crops.
   Thus, developing enantiopure S-(+)pydiflumetofen products might be a
   high-efficiency and low-risk strategy, and more studies should be
   conducted in this aspect.},

   circadian rhythms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {133-137},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental
   chemicals can contribute to the etiology of obesity by inappropriately
   stimulating adipogenesis as well as perturbing lipid metabolism and
   energy balance. One potential mechanism by which chemical exposure can
   influence lipid metabolism is through disturbance of circadian rhythms,
   endogenously-driven cycles of roughly 24hr in length that coordinate
   biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes in all organisms.
   Here we show for the first time that exposure to endocrine disrupting
   compounds (EDCs), including the pesticide tributyltin, two commercial
   flame retardants, and a UV-filter chemical found in sunscreens, can
   perturb both circadian clocks and lipid metabolism in vertebrates.
   Exposure of developing zebrafish to EDCs affects core clock activity and
   leads to a remarkable increase in lipid accumulation that is reminiscent
   of the effects observed for longdaysin, a known disruptor of circadian
   rhythms. Our data reveal a novel obesogenic mechanism of action for
   environmental chemicals, an observation which warrants further research.
   Because circadian clocks regulate a wide variety of physiological
   processes, identification of environmental chemicals capable of
   perturbing these systems may provide important insights into the
   development of environmentally-induced metabolic disease. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {Organophosphate esters (OPEs) have been a focus in the field of

   necessary to conclude the OPE pollution status on a global scale,

   The present review links together the source, fate, and environmental
   behavior of OPEs in remote areas, integrates the occurrence and profile
   data, summarizes their bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, and ecological
   risks, and finally points out the predominant pollution burden of OPEs
   among organic pollutants in remote areas. Given the relatively high

Title = {Applications of the SR4G Transgenic Zebrafish Line for Biomonitoring of
   Stress-Disrupting Compounds: A Proof-of-Concept Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Transgenic zebrafish models have been successfully used in biomonitoring
   and risk assessment studies of environmental pollutants, including
   xenoestrogens, pesticides, and heavy metals. We employed zebrafish larva
   (transgenic SR4G line) with a cortisol-inducible green fluorescence
   protein reporter (eGFP) as a model to detect stress responses upon
   exposure to compounds with environmental impact, including bisphenol A
   (BPA), vinclozolin (VIN), and fluoxetine (FLX). Cortisol, fluorescence
   signal, and mRNA levels of eGFP and 11 targeted genes were measured in a
   homogenized pool of zebrafish larvae, with six experimental replicates
   for each endpoint. Eleven targeted genes were selected according to
   their association with stress-axis and immediate early response class of
   genes. Hydrocortisone (CORT)and dexamethasone (DEX) were used as
   positive and negative controls, respectively. All measurements were done
   in two unstressed and stressed condition using standardized net handling
   as the stressor. A significant positive linear correlation between
   cortisol levels and eGFP mRNA levels was observed (r> 0.9). Based on
   eGFP mRNA levels in unstressed and stressed larvae two predictive models
   were trained (Random Forest and Logistic Regression). Both these models
   could correctly predict the blunted stress response upon exposure to
   BPA, VIN, FLX and the negative control, DEX. The negative predictive
   value (NPV) of these models were 100\%. Similar NPV was observed when
   the predictive models trained based on the mRNA levels of the eleven
   assessed genes. Measurement of whole-body fluorescence intensity signal
   was not significant to detect blunted stress response. Our findings
   support the use of SR4G transgenic larvae as an in vivo biomonitoring
   model to screen chemicals for their stress-disrupting potentials. This
   is important because there is increasing evidence that brief exposures
   to environmental pollutants modify the stress response and critical
   coping behaviors for several generations.},

   Mosquito, Anopheles gambiae},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Functional genetic analysis in Anopheles gambiae would be greatly
   improved by the development of a binary expression system, which would
   allow the more rapid and flexible characterisation of genes influencing
   disease transmission, including those involved in insecticide
   resistance, parasite interaction, host and mate seeking behaviour. The
   Gal4-UAS system, widely used in Drosophila melanogaster functional
   genetics, has been significantly modified to achieve robust application
   in several different species. Towards this end, previous work generated
   a series of modified Gal4 constructs that were up to 20 fold more active
   than the native gene in An. gambiae cells. To examine the Gal4-UAS
   system in vivo, transgenic An. gambiae driver lines carrying a modified
   Gal4 gene under the control of the carboxypeptidase promoter, and
   responder lines carrying UAS regulated luciferase and eYFP reporter
   genes have been created. Crossing of the Gal4 and UAS lines resulted in
   progeny that expressed both reporters in the expected midgut specific
   pattern. Although there was minor variation in reporter gene activity
   between the different crosses examined, the tissue specific expression
   pattern was consistent regardless of the genomic location of the
   transgene cassettes. The results show that the modified Gal4-UAS system
   can be used to successfully activate expression of transgenes in a
   robust and tissue specific manner in Anopheles gambiae. The midgut
   driver and dual reporter responder constructs are the first to be
   developed and tested successfully in transgenic An. gambiae and provide
   the basis for further advancement of the system in this and other insect
   species.},

Title = {Physiological Effects of Neonicotinoid Insecticides on Non-Target
   Aquatic Animals-An Updated Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, we review the effects of large-scale neonicotinoid
   contaminations in the aquatic environment on non-target aquatic
   invertebrate and vertebrate species. These aquatic species are the fauna
   widely exposed to environmental changes and chemical accumulation in
   bodies of water. Neonicotinoids are insecticides that target the
   nicotinic type acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous
   systems (CNS) and are considered selective neurotoxins for insects.
   However, studies on their physiologic impacts and interactions with
   non-target species are limited. In researches dedicated to exploring
   physiologic and toxic outcomes of neonicotinoids, studies relating to
   the effects on vertebrate species represent a minority case compared to
   invertebrate species. For aquatic species, the known effects of
   neonicotinoids are described in the level of organismal, behavioral,
   genetic and physiologic toxicities. Toxicological studies were reported
   based on the environment of bodies of water, temperature, salinity and
   several other factors. There exists a knowledge gap on the relationship
   between toxicity outcomes to regulatory risk valuation. It has been a
   general observation among studies that neonicotinoid insecticides
   demonstrate significant toxicity to an extensive variety of
   invertebrates. Comprehensive analysis of data points to a generalization
   that field-realistic and laboratory exposures could result in different
   or non-comparable results in some cases. Aquatic invertebrates perform
   important roles in balancing a healthy ecosystem, thus rapid screening
   strategies are necessary to verify physiologic and toxicological
   impacts. So far, much of the studies describing field tests on
   non-target species are inadequate and in many cases, obsolete.
   Considering the current literature, this review addresses important
   information gaps relating to the impacts of neonicotinoids on the
   environment and spring forward policies, avoiding adverse biological and
   ecological effects on a range of non-target aquatic species which might
   further impair the whole of the aquatic ecological web.},

Abstract = {The spread of chemicals, including insecticides, into the environment
   often raises public health concerns, as exemplified by a recent
   epidemiologic study associating in utero piperonyl butoxide (PBO)
   exposure with delayed mental development. The insecticide synergist PBO
   is listed among the top 10 chemicals detected in indoor dust; a
   systematic assessment of risks from PBO exposure, as for many toxicants
   unfortunately, may be underdeveloped when important biological targets
   that can cause toxicity are unknown. Hedgehog/Smoothened signaling is
   critical in neurological development. This study was designed to use
   novel high-throughput in vitro drug screening technology to identify
   modulators of Hedgehog signaling in environmental chemicals to assist
   the assessment of their potential risks. A directed library of 1408
   environmental toxicants was screened for Hedgehog/Smoothened antagonist
   activity using a high-content assay that evaluated the interaction
   between Smoothened and beta arrestin2 green fluorescent protein. PBO was
   identified as a Hedgehog/Smoothened antagonist capable of inhibiting
   Hedgehog signaling. We found that PBO bound Smoothened and blocked
   Smoothened overexpression induced Gli-luciferase reporter activity but
   had no effect on Gli-1 downstream transcriptional factor induced Gli
   activity. PBO inhibited Sonic Hedgehog ligand induced Gli signaling and
   mouse cerebellar granular precursor cell proliferation. Moreover, PBO
   disrupted zebrafish development. Our findings demonstrate the value of
   high-throughput target-based screening strategies that can successfully
   evaluate large numbers of environmental toxicants and identify key
   targets and unknown biological activity that is helpful in properly
   assessing potential risks.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Following the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act, which mandated
   an increased focus on evaluating the potential toxicity of pesticides to
   children, the number of guideline developmental neurotoxicity (DNT)
   studies (OPPTS 870.6300) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) was greatly increased.
   To evaluate the impact of available DNT studies on individual chemical
   risk assessments, the ways in which data from these studies are being
   used in pesticide risk assessment were investigated. In addition, the
   neurobehavioral and neuropathological parameters affected at the lowest
   observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for each study were evaluated to
   ascertain whether some types of endpoints were consistently more
   sensitive than others. As of December 2008, final OPP reviews of DNT
   studies for 72 pesticide chemicals were available; elimination of
   studies with major deficiencies resulted in a total of 69 that were
   included in this analysis. Of those studies, 15 had been used to
   determine the point of departure for one or more risk assessment
   scenarios, and an additional 13 were determined to have the potential
   for use as a point of departure for future risk assessments (selection
   is dependent upon review of the entire database available at the time of
   reassessment). Analysis of parameters affected at the study LOAELs
   indicated that no single parameter was consistently more sensitive than
   another. Early assessment time points (e.g., postnatal day (PND) 11/21)
   tended to be more sensitive than later time points (e.g., PND 60). These
   results demonstrate that data generated using the current guideline DNT
   study protocol are useful in providing points of departure for risk
   assessments. The results of these studies also affirm the importance of
   evaluating a spectrum of behavioral and neuropathological endpoints, in
   both young and adult animals, to improve the detection of the potential
   for a chemical to cause developmental neurotoxicity. Published by

Abstract = {Phthalate esters (PAEs) pose prominent ecological risks owing to their
   multiplex toxicity potentials and ubiquitous detection in the
   environment. Therefore, this study aims to prioritize the individual and
   mixtures of six PAEs based on their toxicological implications using in
   vitro and vivo models exposed at environmentally relevant
   concentrations. Results were further confirmed using in silico
   Combination index (CI) and Independent action (IA), and molecular
   docking models. Among PAEs, DEHP revealed prominent in vitro/vivo
   toxicity followed by DEP, DBP, and DMP. Importantly, binary mixtures
   particularly C2-C6 and C11-C15 exhibited greater developmental toxicity,
   apoptosis, and perturbed the HPG pathway. The CI and IA models
   forecasted antagonistic and additive effects at Fa = 0.5 and Fa = 0.9
   using in vitro Acinetobacter sp. Tox2. Conversely, in zebrafish, the IA
   model predicted mixture effects in the following order: additive >
   synergistic > antagonistic on the regulation of the HPG pathway, which
   was consistent with experimental results from Acridine Orange (AO)
   staining and apoptosis gene expression. Molecular docking for estrogen
   receptors (ER alpha, ER beta) revealed the highest bindingenergy scores
   for DEHP, compared to other PAEs. In short, our findings confirm that
   individual and mixtures of PAEs behave as xenoestrogens in the
   freshwater ecosystem with DEHP as a priority compound.},

Abstract = {Cypermethrin (CP) is a kind of chiral pesticides that has been defined
   as endocrine disrupting chemical. The diversity in bioactivity,
   toxicity, metabolism, bioaccumulation, and degradation behaviors of CP
   enantiomers as well as the research deficiency had made the risk
   assessment of CP enantiomers very complicated. Herein, four CP
   enantiomers were separated as target chemicals to investigate their
   enantioselective endocrine disrupting effects. Firstly, dual-luciferase
   reporter gene assays were adopted to investigate their potential
   endocrine disrupting effects via various receptors. The expression
   levels of steroid hormones related genes and hormone secretion levels in
   H295R cell were measured to verify the results. Results from the
   reporter gene assay showed that 1R-cis-alpha S-CP (CP11) exhibited
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and
   thyroid receptor (TR) antagonistic activity with the RIC20 values of

   1R-trans-alpha S-CP (CP21) also showed androgen receptor (AR) agonist
   activity and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonistic activity with the REC20

Title = {Study on systemic and reproductive toxicity of acetochlor in male mice},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Acetochlor is one of the three most abundant herbicides used in China,
   which is a pre-emergence herbicide belonging to chloroacetanilides. It
   is classified as likely to be carcinogenic to humans and suspected as an
   endocrine disruptor by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
   and the European Union Environmental Protection Agency (EUEPA).
   Therefore, there is increasing concern about the risk of acetochlor to
   human health and the environment. However, the current research on
   acetochlor mainly focuses on the assessment of environmental behaviors,
   whereas toxicity studies mainly concentrate on non-mammals such as
   zebrafish. So far, only a few reports of its effects on the male
   reproductive system of animals have been found. In the present study,
   C57BL/6 male mice and GC-1 spermatogonia(spgs) were used to analyze in
   vivo and in vitro toxicities of acetochlor to investigate the
   relationships among acetochlor-induced oxidative stress, endocrine
   dysfunction, degenerative diseases of germ cells and apoptosis. The
   results show that acetochlor can induce systemic and reproductive
   toxicity in subacutely exposed mice, such as clear reduction in body
   weight, liver function damage in mice, oxidative stress damage and
   histopathological degeneration in testicular tissue as the concentration
   of acetochlor increases. In addition, acetochlor might mediate apoptotic
   pathways that affect the survival of GC-1 spgs; in detail, cell
   viability decreases, cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis are elevated, and
   oxidative stress and expression changes of apoptosis-related proteins
   are observed compared with that for control in GC-1 spgs. In addition,
   this study also provides a scientific basis for evaluating the
   toxicological effects of acetochlor as well as its potential damage to
   mammals.},

Title = {Perinatal exposure to FireMaster (R) 550 (FM550), brominated or
   organophosphate flame retardants produces sex and compound specific
   effects on adult Wistar rat socioemotional behavior},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {126},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Firemaster 550 (FM550) is a flame retardant (FR) mixture that has become
   one of the most commonly used FRs in household items such as foam-based
   furniture and baby products. Because this mixture readily leaches from
   products, contamination of the environment and human tissues is
   widespread. Prior work by us and others has reported sex-specific
   behavioral deficits in rodents and zebrafish following early life
   exposure. In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which these
   behavioral effects occur, here we explored the effects of its
   constituents on behavioral outcomes previously shown to be altered by
   developmental FM550 exposure. The FM550 commercial mixture is composed
   of two brominated compounds (BFR) and two organophosphate compounds
   (OPFRs) at almost equivalent proportions. Both the BFR and the OPFR
   components are differentially metabolized and structurally distinct, but
   similar to known neurotoxicants. Here we examined adult Wistar rat
   offspring socioemotional behaviors following perinatal exposure (oral,
   to the dam) to vehicle, 2000 mu g/day FM550, 1000 mu g/day BFR or 1000
   mu g/day OPFR from gestation day 0 to weaning. Beginning on postnatal
   day 65 offspring from all groups were subjected to a series of
   behavioral tasks including open field, elevated plus maze, marble
   burying, social interaction tests, and running wheel. Effects were
   exposure-, sex- and task-specific, with BFR exposure resulting in the
   most consistent behavioral deficits. Overall, exposed females showed
   more deficits compared to males across all dose groups and tasks. These
   findings help elucidate how different classes of flame retardants,
   independently and as a mixture, contribute to sex-specific behavioral
   effects of exposure.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND A controlled-release formulation based on mesoporous silica
   nanoparticles (MSNs) provides an effective way for reducing pesticide
   use and protecting the ecological environment. In this study, MSNs
   loaded with pyraclostrobin (PYR@MSNs) were prepared using a one-pot
   method. RESULTS The characteristics of PYR@MSNs were systematically
   investigated, including morphology, loading content, ultraviolet (UV)
   resistance, release behavior, control effects against pathogens, and
   safety to nontarget organisms. The results show that the prepared
   PYR@MSNs presented characteristics of regular spherical shapes, uniform
   particle size (200 nm), high drug loading (38.9\%), and enhanced UV
   resistance. Compared with traditional formulation, PYR@MSNs exhibited
   improved control effects against Fusarium graminearum, an extended
   control period, and lower toxicity to zebrafish, earthworms and BEAS-2B
   cells. CONCLUSIONS This research will facilitate the development of
   efficient and safe pesticide delivery systems. The PYR@MSNs has showed
   its potential as a new controlled-release formulation with increased

Abstract = {Iron is essential for organisms. It is mainly utilized in mitochondria
   for biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, hemes and other cofactors.
   Mitoferrin 1 and mitoferrin 2, two homologues proteins belonging to the
   mitochondrial solute carrier family, are required for iron delivery into
   mitochondria. Mitoferrin 1 is highly expressed in developing
   erythrocytes which consume a large amount of iron during
   hemoglobinization. Mitoferrin 2 is ubiquitously expressed, whose
   functions are less known. Zebrafish with mitoferrin 1 mutation show
   profound hypochromic anaemia and erythroid maturation arrests, and yeast
   with defects in MRS3/4, the counterparts of mitoferrin 1/2, has low
   mitochondrial iron levels and grows poorly by iron depletion. Mitoferrin
   1 expression is up-regulated in yeast and mouse models of Fiedreich's
   ataxia disease and in human cell culture models of Parkinson disease,
   suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases with
   mitochondrial iron accumulation. In this study we found that reduced
   mitoferrin levels in C. elegans by RNAi treatment causes pleiotropic
   phenotypes such as small body size, reduced fecundity, slow movement and
   increased sensitivity to paraquat. Despite these abnormities, lifespan
   was increased by 50\% to 80\% in N2 wild type strain, and in further
   studies using the RNAi sensitive strain eri-1, more than doubled
   lifespan was observed. The pathways or mechanisms responsible for the
   lifespan extension and other phenotypes of mitoferrin RNAi worms are
   worth further study, which may contribute to our understanding of aging
   mechanisms and the pathogenesis of iron disorder related diseases.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) has been frequently
   detected in environmental media and biological samples. However,
   knowledge of its adverse health consequences is limited. In the current
   study, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans, L1 larvae) were exposed to
   TDCPP at environmentally relevant concentrations (control, 0.1, 1, 100
   and 1000 mu g L-1) for 72 h to explore any association between TDCPP and
   the aging process. Some of the degenerative age-related indicators were
   observed, including locomotion behaviors and lifespan. As crucial
   biomarkers of aging, the accumulation of lipofuscin, and lipid
   peroxidation (LPO) products exemplified by 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (4-HNE)
   were detected. This product forms as a result of oxidative stress, as
   confirmed by an N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pharmacological assay.
   Moreover, a significant increase in reactive oxide species (ROS)
   production in a dose-dependent manner using a fluorescent probe was
   observed. For the underlying molecular mechanism of the above aging
   phenotypes, significantly upregulated transcription of genes related to
   antioxidant systems, especially a subset of glutathione S-transferase
   (gst-5, gst-6, gst-9, gst-10, gst-19, gst-24, gst-26, gst-29, gst-33,
   and gst-38), was found by RNA-Seq and further confirmed by RT-qPCR. The
   elevated glutathione S-transferase (GST) was attributed to the
   significant increase in 4-HNE because mutations in gst-5 and gst-24
   inhibited the conjugation of GSTs with 4-HNE. Therefore, GST play an
   indispensable role in the detoxification process of TDCPP exposure and
   further confirmed LPO accumulation at the molecular mechanism level. In
   conclusion, TDCPP accelerated the aging process induced by the LPO
   products, 4-HNE, response to reactive oxidative species in C. elegans.

Abstract = {Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) is an organophosphate flame retardant that is
   frequently detected in the environments. TPhP exposure is known to cause
   developmental toxicity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms
   remain underestimated. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were
   acutely exposed to 0, 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP until 144 h
   post-fertilization. Profiles of differentially expressed proteins were
   constructed using a shotgun proteomic. With the input of differential
   proteins, principal component analysis suggested different protein
   expression profiles for 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP. Gene ontology and KEGG
   pathway analyses further found that effects of TPhP at 4 mu g/L targeted
   phagosome and lysosome activity, while 100 mu g/L TPhP mainly affected
   carbohydrate metabolism, muscular contraction and phagosome. Based on
   proteomic data, diverse bioassays were employed to ascertain the effects
   of TPhP on specific proteins and pathways. At gene and protein levels,
   expressions of critical visual proteins were significantly changed by
   TPhP exposure, including retinoschisin la, opsins and crystallins,
   implying the impairment of ocular development and function. TPhP
   exposure at 100 mu g/L also altered the abundances of diverse muscular
   proteins and disordered the assembly of muscle fibers. Effects of TPhP
   on visual development and motor activity may be combined to disturb
   larval swimming behavior. In summary, current results provided
   mechanistic clues to the developmental toxicities of TPhP. Future works
   are inspired to broaden the toxicological knowledge of TPhP based on
   current proteomic results.},

Title = {Conventional and nano-copper pesticides are equally toxic to the
   estuarine amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {224},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Modern nano-engineered pesticides have great promise for agriculture due
   to their extended, low dose release profiles that are intended to
   increase effectiveness but reduce environmental harm. Whether
   nanopesticides, including copper (Cu) formulations, cause reduced levels
   of toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms is unclear but important to
   assess. Predicting how aquatic species respond to incidental exposure to
   Cu-based nanopesticides is challenging because of the expected very low
   concentrations in the environment, and the two forms of exposure that
   may occur, namely to Cu ions and Cu nanoparticles. We conducted Cu
   speciation, tissue uptake, and 7-day toxicity laboratory experiments to
   test how a model estuarine organism, the amphipod Leptocheirus
   plumulosus, responded to two popular Cu-based nanopesticides, CuPRO and
   Kocide, and conventional CuCl2. Exposure concentrations ranged from 0 to
   2.5 ppm, which were similar to those found in estuarine water located
   downstream of agricultural fields. Cu dissolution rates were much slower
   for the nanopesticides than the ionic formula, and Cu body burden in
   amphipods increased approximately linearly with the nominal exposure
   concentration. Amphipod survival declined in a normal dose-response
   manner with no difference among Cu formulations. Growth and movement
   rates after 7 days revealed no difference among exposure levels when
   analyzed with conventional statistical methods. By contrast, analysis of
   respiration rates, inferred from biomass measurements, with a
   bioenergetic toxicodynamic model indicated potential for
   population-level effects of exposure to very low-levels of the two
   nanopesticides, as well as the control contaminant CuCl2. Our results
   indicate that toxicity assessment of environmental trace pollutant
   concentrations may go undetected with traditional ecotoxicological
   tests. We present a process integrating toxicity test results and
   toxicodynamic modeling that can improve our capacity to detect and
   predict environmental impacts of very low levels of nanomaterials
   released into the environment.},

Abstract = {There is limited knowledge on the toxicological, physiological, and
   molecular effects attributed to organophosphate (OP) compounds currently
   used as flame retardants or additives in consumer products. This study
   investigated the effects on oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in
   juvenile Atlantic salmon liver and brain samples after exposure to two
   OP compounds, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and
   tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). In this study, groups of juvenile
   Atlantic salmon were exposed using a semistatic experimental protocol
   over a 7-d period to 3 different concentrations (0.04, 0.2, or 1 mg/L)
   of TBOEP and TCEP. When toxicological factors such as bioaccumulation
   and bioconcentration, and chemical structural characteristics and
   behavior, including absorption to solid materials, are considered, these
   concentrations represent environmentally relevant concentrations. The
   concentrations of the contaminants were derived from levels of their
   environmental occurrence. The expression of genes related to oxidative
   stressglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR),
   glutathione S-transferase (GST)and to lipid peroxidationperoxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)were determined using
   quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence
   of PPAR proteins was also investigated using immunochemical methods.
   Levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in liver were
   used as a measure of lipid peroxidation. Overall, our data show an
   increase in lipid peroxidation, and this was associated with an
   augmented expression of genes from the glutathione family of responses.
   Interestingly, PPAR expression in liver after exposure to TBOEP and TCEP
   was consistently decreased compared to controls, while expression in
   brain did not show a similar trend. The results suggest that OP
   contaminants may induce oxidative stress and thus production of reactive
   oxygen substances (ROS), and modulate lipid peroxidation processes in
   organisms.},

Abstract = {Ciguatoxins are natural compounds produced by benthic dinoflagellates

Abstract = {Nanocapsules are a promising controlled release formulation for foliar
   pest control. However, the complicated process and high cost limit
   widespread use in agriculture, so a simpler and more convenient
   preparation system is urgently needed. Meanwhile, under complex field
   conditions, the advantageous mechanism of the nanosize effect and
   sustained release have no quantitative and detailed study. In this
   study, a reactive emulsifier (OP-10) is used to participate in the
   interfacial polymerization of the nanoemulsion, and polymer nanocapsules
   loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin (NCS@LC) are quickly and easily prepared
   to study the efficacy and synergistic mechanism of foliar pest control.
   As a result, the nanocapsule is about 150 nm with a stable core-shell
   structure. The nanoscale state increases the distribution and adhesion
   of the particles on the leaf surface, which increases the contact
   efficiency of pesticides under the different physiological stages and
   behavioral activities of the target organism. The shell structure
   provides sustained release characteristics and increases the UV
   resistance by about 2.5 times for pesticides. Compared with
   microcapsules loaded with lambda-cyhalothrin (CS@LC), NCS@LC not only
   shows rapid and synergistic insecticidal efficacy but also provides
   sustained insecticidal efficacy. The mortality of NCS is 3.4 times that
   of the nanosized emulsion in water (NEW) at the lowest concentration
   (0.5 mg L-1), and the control efficacy remained 77.3\% after 7 days.
   Compared with NEW, NCS@LC provides excellent field efficacy, while LC50
   for zebrafish is only 0.68 times without increasing the aquatic toxicity
   risk.},

   endpoints, behavioural alterations in organisms due to pollutants are
   increasingly studied in ecotoxicology. In fact, behaviour links
   physiological function with ecological processes, and can be very
   sensitive to environmental stimuli and chemical exposure. This is the
   first study on behavioural alteration in a wild population of an Alpine
   species. In the present study, a video tracking system was standardized
   and subsequently used to identify contaminant-induced behavioural
   alterations in Diamesa zernyi larvae (Diptera, Chironomidae). Diamesa
   zernyi larvae, collected in an Italian Alpine stream (Rio Presena,
   Trentino Region), were acclimated for 24 h and successively exposed to
   several aquatic contaminants (pesticides: chlorpyrifos, metolachlor,
   boscalid, captan; pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen, furosemide, trimethoprim)
   at concentrations corresponding to their Lowest Observed Effect
   Concentration (LOEC). After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure, changes in
   the distance moved, the average speed, and the frequency of body bends
   were taken to reflect contaminant- and time-dependent effects on larval
   behaviour. In general, metolachlor, captan, and trimethoprim tended to
   reduce all the endpoints under consideration, whereas chlorpyrifos,
   boscalid, ibuprofen, and furosemide seemed to increase the distances
   moved by the larvae. This could be related to the different mechanisms
   of action of the investigated chemicals. Independently of the
   contaminant, after 72 h a general slowing down of all the behavioural
   activities occurred. Finally, we propose a behavioural stress indicator
   to compare the overall behavioural effects induced by the various
   contaminants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Visual system: An understudied target of aquatic toxicology},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {225},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Visual system is increasingly recognized as a sensitive target of
   xenobiotics in aquatic ecosystems. Various environmental pollutants of
   distinct physicochemical properties are able to impair the retinal
   development and function of teleost fishes, including dioxin-like
   pollutants, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl acids, retinoic
   acids and metals. Considering the availability of developmental and
   functional database, zebrafish has been the most frequently used as the
   teleost model to study aquatic visual toxicology. A diversity of visual
   deficits has been displayed for fishes across multiple levels of
   biological organizations (e.g., molecule, cell, histology, physiology
   and behavior). Covering sensitive developmental windows of eyes during
   early embryogenesis, acute or chronic exposure to xenobiotics can
   disturb the expressions of visual gene and protein markers, which affect
   the retinal neurogenesis and induce degeneration of neurons.
   Morphological structures and physiological responses of retina and optic
   rectum are then disorganized, eventually compromising the performance of
   visually-mediated behaviors and recruitment of individuals.
   Environmental pollutants can cross the blood-retina barrier and
   accumulate in eyes, which might impact visual system directly. In
   addition, pollutants are very likely to interrupt retinal development
   and function indirectly by disturbing the signaling of retinoids and
   thyroid. However, exact mechanisms of visual toxicity are largely
   unknown currently. In this review, the development and structure of
   retina and available tools for studying visual science are described
   briefly. Advances in visual toxicology are summarized in detail and
   outlooks for future visual toxicity studies are discussed.},

Title = {Multi-Behavioral Endpoint Testing of an 87-Chemical Compound Library in
   Freshwater Planarians},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {167},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-44},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is an increased recognition in the field of toxicology of the
   value of medium-to-high-throughput screening methods using in vitro and
   alternative animal models. We have previously introduced the asexual
   freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a new alternative animal model
   and proposed that it is particularly well-suited for the study of
   developmental neurotoxicology. In this article, we discuss how we have
   expanded and automated our screening methodology to allow for fast
   screening of multiple behavioral endpoints, developmental toxicity, and
   mortality. Using an 87-compound library provided by the National
   Toxicology Program, consisting of known and suspected neurotoxicants,
   including drugs, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and presumptive negative
   controls, we further evaluate the benefits and limitations of the system
   for medium-throughput screening, focusing on the technical aspects of
   the system. We show that, in the context of this library, planarians are
   the most sensitive to pesticides with 16/16 compounds causing toxicity
   and the least sensitive to PAHs, with only 5/17 causing toxicity.
   Furthermore, while none of the presumptive negative controls were
   bioactive in adult planarians, 2/5, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic
   acid, were bioactive in regenerating worms. Notably, these compounds
   were previously reported as developmentally toxic in mammalian studies.
   Through parallel screening of adults and developing animals, planarians
   are thus a useful model to detect such developmental-specific effects,
   which was observed for 13 chemicals in this library. We use the data and
   experience gained from this screen to propose guidelines for best
   practices when using planarians for toxicology screens.},

Title = {Generation-specific and interactive effects of pesticide and
   antidepressant exposure in a fish model call for multi-stressor and
   multigenerational testing},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {232},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ecological risks of a pollutant are typically assessed via short-term
   exposure of model organisms to that single compound. Such tests are
   informative, but cannot ascertain effects of long-term and
   multigenerational mixed-stressor exposure with which organisms are often
   confronted in their natural environment. Therefore, full lifecycle and
   multigenerational tests are needed. Yet, these are hampered due to long
   lifespans and generation times of many standard laboratory species, in
   particular for vertebrates such as fish. With a typical lifespan of 6
   months and a generation time of about 3 months, the turquoise killifish
   (Nothobranchius furzeri) may be an ideal model for multigenerational
   testing. In this study, we assessed the impact of full life-cycle
   exposure to the emerging pollutant fluoxetine (0, 0.5 mu g/L) in
   combination with chronic exposure during adulthood to the pesticide
   3,4-dichlomaniline (0, 50, 100 mu g/L) over two successive generations
   of N. furzeri. Overall, both life-history and behaviour were affected by
   exposure to fluoxetine and 3,4-DCA. Inhibitory effects of single
   chemical exposure on growth and fecundity were generation-dependent,
   while enhanced swimming acceleration and feeding in response to
   fluoxetine were dependent on the presence of 3,4-DCA. Together, these
   findings show the relevance of a multi-stressor approach across
   successive generations. Although full life-cycle and multigenerational
   tests are typically assumed to be impractical and costly for fish, we
   deliver an effective demonstration that such studies are possible within
   a timespan of less than 6 months with the killifish N. furzeri as a
   model organism.},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) and
   tris(2-chloro-2-ethyl)phosphate (TCEP) are organophosphorous flame
   retardants with widespread usage and human exposures through food,
   inhalation, and dust ingestion. They have been detected in human tissues
   including urine and breast milk. Reports of disrupted neural growth in
   vitro, abnormal development in larval zebrafish, and altered thyroid
   hormones in several species have raised concern for neurodevelopmental
   toxicity. This is especially the case for TDCIPP, which is more potent
   and has more activity in those assays than does TCEP. We evaluated the
   potential for developmental neurotoxicity of TDCIPP and TCEP in a
   mammalian model. Pregnant Long Evans rats were administered TDCIPP (15,
   50, or 150 mg/kg/day) or TCEP (12, 40, 90 mg/kg/day) via oral gavage
   from gestational day 10 to weaning. Corn oil was the vehicle control in
   both studies. Body weight and righting reflex development were monitored
   in all pups. A subset of offspring at Culling and weaning, and dams at
   weaning, were sacrificed for serum and organ collection for measurement
   of brain, liver, and thyroid weights, serum thyroid levels, and serum
   and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. Brain weights were also
   measured in a group of adult TDCIPP-treated offspring. One male and one
   female from each litter were allocated for behavioral testing at several
   ages: standard locomotor activity (preweaning, postweaning, adults),
   locomotor activity including a lighting change mid-way (postweaning,
   adults), elevated zero maze (postweaning, adults), functional
   observational battery (FOB; postweaning, adults), and Morris water maze
   (place learning, reference and working memory; adults). Neither chemical
   produced changes in maternal body weight or serum thyroid hormones, but
   relative liver weight was increased at the high doses of both TDCIPP and
   TCEP. In offspring, there were no effects on viability, litter size, or
   birth weight. With TDCIPP, absolute liver weights were lower at weaning
   and weight gain was lower in the high-dose offspring until about two
   months of age. Thyroid hormones and brain weights were not altered and
   acetylcholinesterase (both brain and serum) was not inhibited by either
   chemical. TDCIPP-treated offspring showed slight differences in floating
   in the water maze, hindlimb grip strength, and altered activity
   habituation, whereas TCEP-treated rats showed differences in quadrant
   time (probe) and middle-zone preference in the water maze. Regarding
   these few changes, the effects were minimal, mostly not related to dose,
   and did not appear treatment-related or biologically significant
   Overall, these data do not support the potential for thyrotoxicity or
   developmental neurotoxicity produced by TDCIPP or TCEP. Published by

Abstract = {An accurate controlled-release strategy of pesticides is considered

   of dazomet (DZ) was proposed by employing the zeolitic imidazolate
   framework-8 composite (DZ@ZIF-8) by aone-pot method. The synthetic
   parameters of DZ@ZIF-8 were optimized, and the loading content of DZ was
   maximized. ZIF-8endowed DZ with a pH-sensitive behavior. The collapse of
   the DZ@ZIF-8 structure and the site-specific release of DZ weretriggered
   by acidic substances produced byBotrytis cinerea.In vitroand pot
   experiments showed that the fungicidal activity of DZ@ZIF-8 was about
   36.3 and 42.7\% higher than that of DZ, respectively. DZ is
   conventionally used before a crop is planted because ofits volatility
   and toxicity. However, DZ@ZIF-8 could avoid phytotoxicity of DZ to
   plants, which made the application of DZ possibleduring plant growth.
   Moreover, the acute toxicity to zebrafish changed from high to moderate
   levels. This study highlights a potentialstrategy that improves DZ
   effective utilization and reduces side effects.},

Abstract = {Objective The objective of the present study was to elucidate the toxic
   effects of imidacloprid on the embryonic and larval stages of common
   carp (Cyprinus carpio). Methods Each of the 1000 fertilized eggs and
   larvae were exposed to six different concentrations (0, 10, 30, 100,
   300, and 1000 mu g/L) of imidacloprid in 30 plastic bowls. Each of the
   control and treatment was maintained in five replicates. Results Results
   showed that hatching rate of fertilized eggs and number of dead embryos
   and larvae significantly decreased with increasing imidacloprid
   concentrations. The 24-, 48-, and 72-h LC50 value of imidacloprid for
   common carp embryos were estimated to be 12,708.8, 611, and 274.9 mu
   g/L, respectively and the 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h LC50 of imidacloprid
   for common carp larvae were estimated to be 93719, 21691, 2352.7, and
   1292.6 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, results showed several
   malformations of common carp embryos and larvae induced by the toxicity
   of imidacloprid when exposed to 300 and 1000 mu g/L. Conclusion The
   results suggest that the minimum concentration of 10 mu g/L imidacloprid
   in the aquatic environment may have adverse effects on the embryonic and
   larval stages of common carp.},

   and allowed to recover for 7 days. The brain, liver and gills were
   sampled weekly. Fish exposed to different concentrations of the drug
   displayed behavioral responses such as reduced swimming rate, mucus
   secretion, decrease in both the feeding frequency and rate. A duration
   dependent increase in the levels of brain acetylcholinesterase was
   observed among the exposed groups. The result of the sub-lethal exposure
   revealed concentration and duration significant increase in lipid

   reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione
   peroxide (GPx) in both the liver and gill tissues of the exposed groups

Abstract = {Simple Summary With the rapid development of technology, artificial
   intelligent become a major breakthrough that can help human with
   laborious job. Previously cardiac imaging in Daphnia was also suffer
   from laborious and tedious process to extract some information from it.
   Thus the aim of this study was to develop a simple artificial
   intelligent based method to help anyone in this field to perform
   analysis in fast, reliable, and less tedious manner. In this study, we
   compare U-Net and Mask RCNN and found out that Mask RCNN was perform
   better than U-Net in cardiac chamber area estimation. From this data,
   several parameter like heart rhythm, stroke volume, ejection fraction,
   fractional shortening, and cardiac output can be extracted. The
   validation was done by comparing the normal and Roundup exposed group
   and it show that Roundup can increase the stroke volume, cardiac output,
   and the shortening fraction of Daphnia magna. Water fleas are an
   important lower invertebrate model that are usually used for ecotoxicity
   studies. Contrary to mammals, the heart of a water flea has a single
   chamber, which is relatively big in size and with fast-beating
   properties. Previous cardiac chamber volume measurement methods are
   primarily based on ImageJ manual counting at systolic and diastolic
   phases which suffer from low efficiency, high variation, and tedious
   operation. This study provides an automated and robust pipeline for
   cardiac chamber size estimation by a deep learning approach. Image
   segmentation analysis was performed using U-Net and Mask RCNN
   convolutional networks on several different species of water fleas such
   as Moina sp., Daphnia magna, and Daphnia pulex. The results show that
   Mask RCNN performs better than U-Net at the segmentation of water fleas'
   heart chamber in every parameter tested. The predictive model generated
   by Mask RCNN was further analyzed with the Cv2.fitEllipse function in
   OpenCV to perform a cardiac physiology assessment of Daphnia magna after
   challenging with the herbicide of Roundup. Significant increase in
   normalized stroke volume, cardiac output, and the shortening fraction
   was observed after Roundup exposure which suggests the possibility of
   heart chamber alteration after roundup exposure. Overall, the predictive
   Mask RCNN model established in this study provides a convenient and
   robust approach for cardiac chamber size and cardiac physiology
   measurement in water fleas for the first time. This innovative tool can
   offer many benefits to other research using water fleas for ecotoxicity
   studies.},

Title = {Review of emerging contaminant tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate:
   Environmental occurrence, exposure, and risks to organisms and human
   health},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {143},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is a halogen-containing
   organophosphorus chemical that is widely employed in various consumer
   products with a high production volume. As an additive flame retardant
   (FR), TDCPP tends to be released into the environment through multiple
   routes. It is ubiquitous in environmental media, biotic matrixes, and
   humans, and thus is deemed to be an emerging environmental contaminant.
   To date, significant levels of TDCPP and its primary diester metabolite,
   bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, have been detected in human samples
   of seminal plasma, breast milk, blood plasma, placenta, and urine,
   thereby causing wide concern about the potential human health effects
   resulting from exposure to this chemical. Despite the progress in
   research on TDCPP over the past few years, we are still far from fully
   understanding the environmental behavior and health risks of this
   emerging contaminant. Thus, this paper critically reviews the
   environmental occurrence, exposure, and risks posed by TDCPP to
   organisms and human health among the literature published in the last
   decade. It has been demonstrated that TDCPP induces acute-, nerve-,
   developmental-, reproductive-, hepatic-, nephron-, and
   endocrine-disrupting toxicity in animals, which has caused increasing
   concern worldwide. Simultaneously, TDCPP induces cytotoxicity by
   increasing the formation of reactive oxygen species and inducing
   endoplasmic reticulum stress in multiple human cell lines in vitro, and
   also causes endocrine-disrupting effects, including reproductive
   dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes, according to human
   epidemiology studies. This review not only provides a better
   understanding of the behavior of this emerging contaminant in the
   environment, but also enhances the comprehension of the health risks
   posed by TDCPP exposure to ecosystems and humans.},

Abstract = {The 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) is an environmental persistent pollutant
   widely used as flame retardant, antimicrobial and insecticide agent in
   wood preservation and plastic production. Currently, TBP is found in
   environmental compartments such as soil, freshwater, groundwater, sewage
   sludge and domestic dust, but the effects to biota and the risk of
   exposure to aquatic vertebrates are still scarce. In the present study,
   Rhamdia quelen fish embryos (8 h post-fertilization - hpf) were exposed
   to 0.3 and 3.0 mu g L-1 of TBP until 96 hpf. Biochemical biomarkers,
   hatching, survival and larvae/embryo malformations were evaluated after
   exposure. Additionally, a mathematical model was proposed to evaluate
   the effects along further generations. The results showed that TBP
   decreased the survival level but did not cause significant difference in
   the hatching rates. After 72 and 96 hpf, individuals from the highest
   tested concentration group showed more severe malformations than
   individuals from control and the lower concentrations groups. The
   deformities were concentrated on the embryos facial region where the
   sensorial structures related to fish behavior are present. The
   biochemical biomarkers revealed both oxidative stress and neurotoxicity
   signs after exposure to the contaminant, while the application of the
   mathematical model showed a decrease of population in both tested TBP
   concentrations. In conclusion, the current results demonstrated that TBP
   is toxic to R. quelen embryos and represents a risk to population after
   early life stage exposure.},

Abstract = {Asexual freshwater planarians are an attractive invertebrate model for
   high-throughput neurotoxicity screening, because they possess multiple
   quantifiable behaviors to assess distinct neuronal functions. Planarians
   uniquely allow direct comparisons between developing and adult animals
   to distinguish developmentally selective effects from general
   neurotoxicity. In this study, we used our automated planarian screening
   platform to compare the neurotoxicity of 15 flame retardants (FRs),
   consisting of representative phased-out brominated (BFRs) and
   replacement organophosphorus FRs (OPFRs). OPFRs have emerged as a
   proposed safer alternative to BFRs; however, limited information is
   available on their health effects. We found 11 of the 15 FRs (3/6 BFRs,
   7/8 OPFRs, and Firemaster 550) caused adverse effects in both adult and
   developing planarians with similar nominal lowest-effect-levels for BFRs
   and OPFRs. This suggests that replacement OPFRs are comparably
   neurotoxic to the phased-out compounds. BFRs were primarily systemically
   toxic, whereas OPFRs, except Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, shared a
   behavioral phenotype in response to noxious heat at sublethal
   concentrations, indicating specific neurotoxic effects. We found this
   behavioral phenotype was correlated with cholinesterase inhibition, thus
   linking behavioral outcomes to molecular targets. By directly comparing
   effects on adult and developing planarians, we further found that one
   BFR (3,3',5,5'-Tetrabromobisphenol A) caused a developmental selective
   defect. Together, these results demonstrate that our planarian screening
   platform yields high content data from various behavioral and
   morphological endpoints, allowing us to distinguish selective neurotoxic
   effects and effects specific to the developing nervous system. Ten of
   these 11 bioactive FRs were previously found to be bioactive in other
   models, including cell culture and alternative animal models (nematodes
   and zebrafish). This level of concordance across different platforms
   emphasizes the urgent need for further evaluation of OPFRs in mammalian
   systems.},
