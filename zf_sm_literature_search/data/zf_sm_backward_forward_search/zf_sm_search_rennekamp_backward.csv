Bacterial type II CRISPR systems have been adapted to create guide RNAs that direct site-specific DNA cleavage by the Cas9 endonuclease in cultured cells. Here we show that the CRISPR-Cas system functions in vivo to induce targeted genetic modifications in zebrafish embryos with efficiencies similar to those obtained using zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases.

To investigate whether some strategies have been more successful than others in the discovery of new drugs, we analysed the discovery strategies and the molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) for new molecular entities and new biologics that were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008. Out of the 259 agents that were approved, 75 were first-in-class drugs with new MMOAs, and out of these, 50 (67%) were small molecules and 25 (33%) were biologics. The results also show that the contribution of phenotypic screening to the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs exceeded that of target-based approaches with 28 and 17 of these drugs coming from the two approaches, respectively in an era in which the major focus was on target-based approaches. We postulate that a target-centric approach for first-in-class drugs, without consideration of an optimal MMOA, may contribute to the current high attrition rates and low productivity in pharmaceutical research and development. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Definitive HSCs derived during embryogenesis in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region subsequently colonize fetal and adult haematopoietic organs. To identify new modulators of HSC formation and homeostasis, a panel of biologically active compounds was screened for effects on stem cell induction in the zebrafish aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. Here, we show that chemicals that enhance prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis increased HSC numbers, and those that block prostaglandin synthesis decreased stem cell numbers. The cyclooxygenases responsible for PGE2 synthesis were required for HSC formation. A stable derivative of PGE2 improved kidney marrow recovery following irradiation injury in the adult zebrafish. In murine embryonic stem cell differentiation assays, PGE2 caused amplification of multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, ex vivo exposure to stabilized PGE2 enhanced spleen colony forming units at day 12 post transplant and increased the frequency of long-term repopulating HSCs present in murine bone marrow after limiting dilution competitive transplantation. The conserved role for PGE2 in the regulation of vertebrate HSC homeostasis indicates that modulation of the prostaglandin pathway may facilitate expansion of HSC number for therapeutic purposes. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"prostaglandin E2; assay; cyprinid; embryonic development; homeostasis; organic compound; signaling; vertebrate; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; colony forming unit; embryo; enzyme analysis; ex vivo study; hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem cell; nonhuman; priority journal; prostaglandin synthesis; regulatory mechanism; spleen; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Murinae; Vertebrata",,"prostaglandin E2, 363-24-6",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL048801; American Heart Association, AHA; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, LLS; American Gastroenterological Association, AGA","Acknowledgements We thank the Institute of Chemical and Cellular Biology at Harvard Medical School for access to the chemical libraries used in the screen.

To address this, we have created a transparent adult zebrafish in which we transplanted either hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells or tumor cells. In a hematopoiesis radiation recovery assay, transplantation of GFP-labeled marrow cells allowed for striking in vivo visual assessment of engraftment from 2 hr-5 weeks posttransplant. Using FACS analysis, both transparent and wild-type fish had equal engraftment, but this could only be visualized in the transparent recipient. In a tumor engraftment model, transplantation of RAS-melanoma cells allowed for visualization of tumor engraftment, proliferation, and distant metastases in as little as 5 days, which is not seen in wild-type recipients until 3 to 4 weeks. This transparent adult zebrafish serves as the ideal combination of both sensitivity and resolution for in vivo stem cell analyses. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here we describe the first known small-molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling-dorsomorphin, which we identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral axis formation in zebrafish. We found that dorsomorphin selectively inhibits the BMP type I receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and thus blocks BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, target gene transcription and osteogenic differentiation. Using dorsomorphin, we examined the role of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. In vitro, dorsomorphin inhibited BMP-, hemojuvelin- and interleukin 6-stimulated expression of the systemic iron regulator hepcidin, which suggests that BMP receptors regulate hepcidin induction by all of these stimuli. In vivo, systemic challenge with iron rapidly induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression in the liver, whereas treatment with dorsomorphin blocked SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, normalized hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels. These findings suggest an essential physiological role for hepatic BMP signaling in iron-hepcidin homeostasis. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"bone morphogenetic protein; dorsomorphin; hepcidin; iron; protein; Smad protein; Smad5 protein; Smad8 protein; unclassified drug; article; bone development; cell differentiation; embryo; embryo development; embryo pattern formation; embryo polarity; gene targeting; iron blood level; iron metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein structure; protein synthesis inhibition; structure analysis; transcription termination; zebra fish; Danio rerio",,"hepcidin, 342809-17-0; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; protein, 67254-75-5; Smad protein, 62395-38-4; Smad5 protein, 193228-56-7",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K08HL079943, K08HL081535, R01HL074352, R01HL079267; National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA118498; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: K08DK075846, R01DK071837","We are grateful to H.

We report the development and application of a high-throughput, quantitative screen for drugs that alter the behavior of larval zebrafish. We found that the multidimensional nature of observed phenotypes enabled the hierarchical clustering of molecules according to shared behaviors. Behavioral profiling revealed conserved functions of psychotropic molecules and predicted the mechanisms of action of poorly characterized compounds. In addition, behavioral profiling implicated new factors such as ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) potassium channels and immunomodulators in the control of rest and locomotor activity. These results demonstrate the power of high-throughput behavioral profiling in zebrafish to discover and characterize psychotropic drugs and to dissect the pharmacology of complex behaviors.",,"3alpha bis(4 fluorophenyl)methoxytropane; 9 chloro 2 (2 furyl) 5 phenylacetylamino 1,2,4 triazolo[1,5 c]quinazoline; amitraz; antiinflammatory agent; cetirizine; clenbuterol; clonidine; cyclosporin; dofetilide; dopamine uptake inhibitor; fexofenadine; glucocorticoid; halofantrine; haloperidol; immunomodulating agent; insecticide; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; potassium channel HERG; serotonin uptake inhibitor; sinapic acid; sinapic acid derivative; terfenadine; unclassified drug; valproic acid; verapamil; behavioral ecology; cyprinid; drug; gene expression; larva; locomotion; potassium; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; behavioral science; controlled study; drug mechanism; drug protein binding; high throughput screening; human; larva; locomotion; long QT syndrome; nonhuman; phenotype; predictive validity; priority journal; rest; wakefulness; zebra fish; Algorithms; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Behavior, Animal; Calcium Channel Blockers; Calcium Channels, L-Type; Cluster Analysis; Cytokines; Drug Discovery; Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Larva; Motor Activity; Potassium Channel Blockers; Psychotropic Drugs; Rest; Signal Transduction; Sleep; Small Molecule Libraries; Wakefulness; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Danio rerio",,"9 chloro 2 (2 furyl) 5 phenylacetylamino 1,2,4 triazolo[1,5 c]quinazoline, 183721-15-5; amitraz, 33089-61-1; cetirizine, 83881-51-0, 83881-52-1; clenbuterol, 21898-19-1, 37148-27-9; clonidine, 4205-90-7, 4205-91-8, 57066-25-8; cyclosporin, 79217-60-0; dofetilide, 115256-11-6; fexofenadine, 138452-21-8; halofantrine, 36167-63-2, 66051-63-6, 66051-74-9, 66051-76-1, 69756-53-2; haloperidol, 52-86-8; sinapic acid, 530-59-6; terfenadine, 50679-08-8; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1; verapamil, 152-11-4, 52-53-9; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Calcium Channel Blockers; Calcium Channels, L-Type; Cytokines; Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels; Potassium Channel Blockers; Psychotropic Drugs; Small Molecule Libraries; Zebrafish Proteins","mrs 1220",,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: K01MH091449, R01MH086867, R21MH085205; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: T32HL007208; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM085357; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R00NS060996",,"Agid, Y., (2007) Nat.

Affected individuals harbor conserved mutations in the ACVR1 gene that are thought to cause constitutive activation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2). Here we show that intramuscular expression in the mouse of an inducible transgene encoding constitutively active ALK2 (caALK2), resulting from a glutamine to aspartic acid change at amino acid position 207, leads to ectopic endochondral bone formation, joint fusion and functional impairment, thus phenocopying key aspects of human FOP. A selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-193189 (ref. 6), inhibits activation of the BMP signaling effectors SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in tissues expressing caALK2 induced by adenovirus specifying Cre (Ad.Cre). This treatment resulted in a reduction in ectopic ossification and functional impairment. In contrast to localized induction of caALK2 by Ad.Cre (which entails inflammation), global postnatal expression of caALK2 (induced without the use of Ad.Cre and thus without inflammation) does not lead to ectopic ossification. However, if in this context an inflammatory stimulus was provided with a control adenovirus, ectopic bone formation was induced. Like LDN-193189, corticosteroid inhibits ossification in Ad.Cre-injected mutant mice, suggesting caALK2 expression and an inflammatory milieu are both required for the development of ectopic ossification in this model. These results support the role of dysregulated ALK2 kinase activity in the pathogenesis of FOP and suggest that small molecule inhibition of BMP type I receptor activity may be useful in treating FOP and heterotopic ossification syndromes associated with excessive BMP signaling. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"4 [6 (4 piperazin 1 ylphenyl)pyrazolo[1,5 a]pyrimidin 3 yl]quinoline; activin receptor like kinase 2; aspartic acid; corticosteroid; enzyme inhibitor; glutamine; ldn 193189; procollagen c proteinase; protein serine threonine kinase; quinoline derivative; Smad1 protein; Smad5 protein; Smad8 protein; unclassified drug; Adenovirus; animal experiment; animal model; arthrodesis; article; controlled study; enchondral ossification; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; functional disease; gene expression; heterotopic ossification; inhibition kinetics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; stimulus; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Structure; Myositis Ossificans; Ossification, Heterotopic; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Signal Transduction; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Adenoviridae; Mus",,"aspartic acid, 56-84-8, 6899-03-2; glutamine, 56-85-9, 6899-04-3; Smad1 protein, 444952-89-0; Smad5 protein, 193228-56-7; (6-(4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl))-3-pyridin-4-ylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidine; Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I, EC 2.7.1.37; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines","ldn 193189",,"ES071003-10; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHMI; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K08HL079943, K08HL081535, R01HL074352; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R21NS067497; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS: Z01ES071003","We thank P. ten Dijke (Leiden University Medical Center) for providing BRE-Luc and CAGA-Luc and K.

Because the timing of many developmental events is critical, it would be useful to have temporal control over modulation of gene function, a luxury frequently not possible with genetic mutants. Here, we demonstrate that small molecules capable of conditional gene product modulation can be identified through developmental screens is zebrafish. We have identified several small molecules that specifically modulate various aspects of vertebrate ontogeny, including development of the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the neural crest, and the ear. Several of the small molecules identified allowed us to dissect the logic of melanocyte and otolith development and to identify critical periods for these events. Small molecules identified in this way offer potential to dissect further these and other developmental processes and to identify novel genes involved in vertebrate development.",,"animal experiment; article; controlled study; ear; embryo; embryo development; heart development; mutagenesis; nervous system development; neural crest; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; vertebrate; zebra fish; Animals; Cardiovascular System; Central Nervous System; Ear; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Melanocytes; Mutagenesis; Vertebrates; Zebrafish; Animalia; Danio rerio; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Gaffield, W., Incardona, J.P., Kapur, R.P., Roelink, H., (1999) Cell.

However, it has been difficult to discover novel neuroactive drugs. Here, we describe a high-throughput, behavior-based approach to neuroactive small molecule discovery in the zebrafish. We used automated screening assays to evaluate thousands of chemical compounds and found that diverse classes of neuroactive molecules caused distinct patterns of behavior. These 'behavioral barcodes' can be used to rapidly identify new psychotropic chemicals and to predict their molecular targets. For example, we identified new acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors using phenotypic comparisons and computational techniques. By combining high-throughput screening technologies with behavioral phenotyping in vivo, behavior-based chemical screens can accelerate the pace of neuroactive drug discovery and provide small-molecule tools for understanding vertebrate behavior. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

Current in vitro preclinical assays are limited by biological simplicity, and in vivo models suffer from expense and low throughput. Methods and Results - During a screen for the effects of 100 small molecules on the heart rate of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, we found that drugs that cause QT prolongation in humans consistently caused bradycardia and AV block in the zebrafish. Of 23 such drugs tested, 18 were positive in this initial screen. Poor absorption explained 4 of 5 false-negative results, as demonstrated by microinjection. Overall, 22 of 23 compounds that cause repolarization abnormalities were positive in this assay, Antisense ""knockdown"" of the zebrafish KCNH2 ortholog yielded bradycardia in a dose dependent manner confirming the effects of reduction of repolarizing potassium current in this model. Classical drug-drug interactions between erythromycin and cisapride, as well as cimetidine and terfenadine, were also reproduced. Conclusion - This simple high-throughput assay is a promising addition to the repertoire of preclinical tests for drug-induced repolarization abnormalities. The genetic tractability of the zebrafish will allow the exploration of heritable modifiers of such drug effects.","Arrhythmia; Drugs; Electrophysiology; Genes","aciclovir; amantadine; amiodarone; amitriptyline;

It is unknown to what extent the programs that regulate neural crest development interact with mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human melanoma. We have used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF(V600E) (which encodes an amino acid substitution mutant of BRAF) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V600E) and lack p53 (also known as tp53) have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule suppressors of the neural crest lineage, which were then tested for their effects on melanoma. One class of compound, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for example leflunomide, led to an almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft studies. Taken together, these studies highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that have a direct bearing on melanoma formation. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Phenotype-based screens offer the potential to identify pathways and potential therapies that influence disease processes. The zebrafish mutation gridlock (grl, affecting the gene hey2) disrupts aortic blood flow in a region and physiological manner akin to aortic coarctation in humans. Here we use a whole-organism, phenotype-based, small-molecule screen to discover a class of compounds that suppress the coarctation phenotype and permit survival to adulthood. These compounds function during the specification and migration of angioblasts. They act to upregulate expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the activation of the VEGF pathway is sufficient to suppress the gridlock phenotype. Thus, organism-based screens allow the discovery of small molecules that ameliorate complex dysmorphic syndromes even without targeting the affected gene directly.",,"Disease control; Drug products; Genes; Mathematical models; Physiology; Drug discovery; Molecular target; Mutation; Biotechnology; messenger RNA; vasculotropin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta coarctation; aorta flow; article; cell function; cell migration; chemical binding; controlled study; disease model; drug design; drug targeting; gene; gene expression regulation; gene mutation; grl gene; Hey2 gene; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; survival; syndrome delineation; teratology; zebra fish; Animals; Aortic Coarctation; Base Sequence; Disease Models, Animal; DNA Primers; Mutation; Zebrafish; Animalia; Danio rerio",,"vasculotropin, 127464-60-2; DNA Primers",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K08HL076361; Donald W.

Here we demonstrate that RGN-induced mutations are heritable, with efficiencies of germline transmission reaching as high as 100%. In addition, we extend the power of the RGN system by showing that these nucleases can be used with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) to create precise intended sequence modifications, including single nucleotide substitutions. Finally, we describe and validate simple strategies that improve the targeting range of RGNs from 1 in every 128 basepairs (bps) of random DNA sequence to 1 in every 8 bps. Together, these advances expand the utility of the CRISPR-Cas system in the zebrafish beyond somatic indel formation to heritable and precise genome modifications. © 2013 Hwang et al.",,"nuclease; RNA guided nuclease;

Mutants exhibit spontaneous abnormal electrographic activity, hyperactivity and convulsive behaviours. Although scn1Lab expression is reduced, microarray analysis is remarkable for the small fraction of differentially expressed genes (∼3%) and lack of compensatory expression changes in other scn subunits. Ketogenic diet, diazepam, valproate, potassium bromide and stiripentol attenuate mutant seizure activity; seven other antiepileptic drugs have no effect. A phenotype-based screen of 320 compounds identifies a US Food and Drug Administration-approved compound (clemizole) that inhibits convulsive behaviours and electrographic seizures. This approach represents a new direction in modelling pediatric epilepsy and could be used to identify novel therapeutics for any monogenic epilepsy disorder. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"4 aminobutyric acid receptor; acetazolamide; carbamazepine; clemizole; diazepam; ethosuximide; messenger RNA; phenytoin; potassium bromide; sodium channel Nav1.1; stiripentol; valproic acid; vigabatrin; compensation; cyprinid; drug resistance; gene expression; mutation; phenotype; sodium; animal experiment; animal model; article; cerebellum; chemical mutagenesis; controlled study; convulsion; drug identification; drug screening; electrography; embryo; epileptic discharge; food and drug administration; gap junction; gene expression; gene mutation; high throughput screening; hyperactivity; in situ hybridization; ketogenic diet; larval development; locomotion; microarray analysis; mutant; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy; superior colliculus; synaptogenesis; telencephalon; wild type; zebra fish; United States; Animals; Anticonvulsants; Benzimidazoles; Bromides; Diazepam; Dioxolanes; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Epilepsies, Myoclonic; Gene Expression Profiling; Mutation; NAV1.1 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel; Potassium Compounds; Seizures; Valproic Acid; Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel beta-1 Subunit; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins","GENBANK: NM_131628, NM_200132","acetazolamide, 1424-27-7, 59-66-5; carbamazepine, 298-46-4, 8047-84-5; clemizole, 1163-36-6, 442-52-4; diazepam, 439-14-5; ethosuximide, 77-67-8; phenytoin, 57-41-0, 630-93-3; potassium bromide, 7758-02-3; stiripentol, 49763-96-4; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1; vigabatrin, 60643-86-9",,,"UL1 RR024131; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R01NS079214; National Center for Research Resources, NCRR: UL1RR024131; Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy, CURE; Dravet Syndrome Foundation, DSF","We thank Herwig Baier and Stephen Ekker for zebrafish lines used in this study; the Sandler Asthma Basic Research (SABRE) Center Functional Genomics Core Facility and NIH/NCRR UCSF-CTSI Grant Number UL1 RR024131 for the microarray support; Wyatt Potter, Robert Hunt and MacKenzie Howard for critical comments on the manuscript; and Rosanne Estrada for assistance with qPCR.

Relevant biological platforms and new computational tools are needed to prioritize testing of chemicals with limited human health hazard information. We describe an experimental design for high-throughput characterization of multidimensional in vivo effects with the power to evaluate trends relating to commonly cited chemical predictors. We evaluated all 1060 unique U.S. EPA ToxCast phase 1 and 2 compounds using the embryonic zebrafish and found that 487 induced significant adverse biological responses. The utilization of 18 simultaneously measured endpoints means that the entire system serves as a robust biological sensor for chemical hazard. The experimental design enabled us to describe global patterns of variation across tested compounds, evaluate the concordance of the available in vitro and in vivo phase 1 data with this study, highlight specific mechanisms/value-added/ novel biology related to notochord development, and demonstrate that the developmental zebrafish detects adverse responses that would be missed by less comprehensive testing strategies. © The Author 2013.

ZFNs are artificial restriction endonucleases consisting of a non-specific nuclease domain fused to a zinc finger array which can be engineered to recognize specific DNA sequences of interest. Recent proof-of-principle experiments have shown that targeted knockout mutations can be efficiently generated in endogenous zebrafish genes via non-homologous end-joining-mediated repair of ZFN-induced DNA double-stranded breaks. The Zinc Finger Consortium, a group of academic laboratories committed to the development of engineered zinc finger technology, recently described the first rapid, highly effective, and publicly available method for engineering zinc finger arrays. The Consortium has previously used this new method (known as OPEN for Oligomerized Pool ENgineering) to generate high quality ZFN pairs that function in human and plant cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that OPEN can also be used to generate ZFNs that function efficiently in zebrafish. Using OPEN, we successfully engineered ZFN pairs for five endogenous zebrafish genes: tfr2, dopamine transporter, telomerase, hif1aa, and gridlock. Each of these ZFN pairs induces targeted insertions and deletions with high efficiency at its endogenous gene target in somatic zebrafish cells. In addition, these mutations are transmitted through the germline with sufficiently high frequency such that only a small number of fish need to be screened to identify founders. Finally, in silico analysis demonstrates that one or more potential OPEN ZFN sites can be found within the first three coding exons of more than 25,000 different endogenous zebrafish gene transcripts. Conclusions and Significance: In summary, our study nearly triples the total number of endogenous zebrafish genes successfully modified using ZFNs (from three to eight) and suggests that OPEN provides a reliable method for introducing targeted mutations in nearly any zebrafish gene of interest. © 2009 Foley et al.",,"dopamine transporter; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; protein gridlock; telomerase; transferrin receptor 2; unclassified drug; zebrafish protein; zinc finger nuclease; zinc finger protein; article; controlled study; DNA microarray; DNA modification; embryo; exon; fish genetics; gene deletion; gene function; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene targeting; genetic engineering; genetic transcription; nonhuman; oligomerized pool Engineering; somatic mutation; Danio rerio",,,,,,,"Cathomen, T., Joung, J.K., Zinc-finger nucleases: The next generation emerges (2008) Mol Ther, 16, pp. 1200-1207; Porteus, M.H., Carroll, D., Gene targeting using zinc finger nucleases (2005) Nat Biotechnol, 23, pp. 967-973; Durai, S., Mani, M., Kandavelou, K., Wu, J., Porteus, M.H., Zinc finger nucleases: Custom-designed molecular scissors for genome engineering of plant and mammalian cells (2005) Nucleic Acids Res, 33, pp. 5978-5990; Carroll, D., (2008) Progress and prospects: Zinc-finger nucleases as gene therapy agents, , Gene Ther; Wu, J., Kandavelou, K., Chandrasegaran, S., Custom-designed zinc finger nucleases: What is next?

Recent work has shown that TALENs can induce mutations in endogenous zebrafish genes, but to date only four genes have been altered, and larger-scale tests of the success rate, mutation efficiencies and germline transmission rates have not been described. Here, we constructed homodimeric TALENs to 10 different targets in various endogenous zebrafish genes and found that 7 nuclease pairs induced targeted indel mutations with high efficiencies ranging from 2 to 76%. We also tested obligate heterodimeric TALENs and found that these nucleases induce mutations with comparable or higher frequencies and have better toxicity profiles than their homodimeric counterparts. Importantly, mutations induced by both homodimeric and heterodimeric TALENs are passed efficiently through the germline, in some cases reaching 100% transmission. For one target gene sequence, we observed substantially reduced mutagenesis efficiency for a variant site bearing two mismatched nucleotides, raising the possibility that TALENs might be used to perform allele-specific gene disruption. Our results suggest that construction of one to two heterodimeric TALEN pairs for any given gene will, in most cases, enable researchers to rapidly generate knockout zebrafish. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"heterodimer transcription activator like effector nuclease; homodimer transcription activator like effector nuclease; messenger RNA; nuclease; unclassified drug; allele; article; gene disruption; gene inactivation; gene mutation; gene sequence; gene targeting; genetic analysis; germ line; heredity; indel mutation; mutagenesis; mutation rate; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; somatic mutation; zebra fish; Alleles; Animals; Base Sequence; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific; Dimerization; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Knockout Techniques; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Trans-Activators; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",,"nuclease, 9026-81-7; DNA-Binding Proteins; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific, 3.1.21.4; Trans-Activators; endodeoxyribonuclease FokI, 3.1.21.-",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DBI-0923827; National Institutes of Health, NIH: DP1 OD006862, K01 AG031300, R01 GM088040, T32 CA009216","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM088040 to J.K.J. and R.T.P.]; NIH Director’s Pioneer Award [DP1 OD006862 to J.K.J., T32 CA009216 to J.D.S. and K01 AG031300 to J.-R.J.Y.]; Jim and Ann Orr MGH Research Scholar award (to J.K.J.); Charles and Ann Sanders MGH Research Scholar award (to R.T.P.); National Science Foundation [DBI-0923827 to D.R.].

Zebrafish offer the potential for high-throughput drug discovery in a whole vertebrate system. We developed the first quantitative, automated assay for antiangiogenic compound identification using zebrafish embryos. This assay uses transgenic zebrafish with fluorescent blood vessels to facilitate image analysis. We developed methods for automated drugging and imaging of zebrafish in 384-well plates and developed a custom algorithm to quantify the number of angiogenic blood vessels in zebrafish. The assay was used to screen the LOPAC1280 compound library for antiangiogenic compounds. Two known antiangiogenic compounds, SU4312 and AG1478, were identified as hits. Additionally, one compound with no previously known antiangiogenic activity, indirubin-3′-monoxime (IRO), was identified. We showed that each of the hit compounds had dose-dependent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish. The IC50 of SU4312, AG1478, and IRO in the zebrafish angiogenesis assay was 1.8, 8.5, and 0.31 μmol/L, respectively. IRO had the highest potency of the hit compounds. Moreover, IRO inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation and proliferation (IC50 of 6.5 and 0.36 μmol/L, respectively). It is therefore the first antiangiogenic compound discovered initially in a zebrafish assay that also has demonstrable activity in human endothelial cell-based angiogenesis assays. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"4 (3 chloroanilino) 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline; angiogenesis inhibitor; indirubin 3' monoxime; su 4312; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; animal experiment; antiangiogenic activity; article; automation; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryo; human; human cell; image analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; screening test; zebra fish; Algorithms; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Automation; Blood Vessels; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Indoles; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Oximes; Thymidine; Umbilical Veins; Zebrafish",,"4 (3 chloroanilino) 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline, 153436-53-4; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Indoles; Oximes; Thymidine, 50-89-5; indirubin, 479-41-4; indirubin-3'-monoxime","ag 1478; su 4312",,"National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI: U54HG003918; National Cancer Institute, NCI: R43CA117000",,"Auerbach, R., Lewis, R., Shinners, B., Kubai, L., Akhtar, N., Angiogenesis assays: A critical overview (2000) Cancer Metastasis Rev, 49, pp. 32-40; Isogai, S., Horiguchi, M., Weinstein, B.M., The vascular anatomy of the developing zebrafish: An atlas of embryonic and early larval development (2001) Dev Biol, 230, pp. 278-301; Liang, D., Chang, J.R., Chin, A.J., The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and hematopoesis in zebrafish development (2001) Mech Dev, 108, pp. 29-43; Lyons, M.S., Bell, B., Stainier, D.Y., Peters, K.G., Isolation of the zebrafish homologues for the tie-1 and tie-2 endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinases (1998) Dev Dyn, 212, pp. 133-140; Chan, J., Bayliss, P.E., Wood, J.M., Roberts, T.M., Dissection of angiogenic signaling in zebrafish using a chemical genetic approach (2002) Cancer Cell, 1, pp. 257-267; Cross, L.M., Cook, M.A., Lin, S., Chen, J.N., Rubinstein, A.L., Rapid analysis of angiogenic drugs in a live fluorescent zebrafish assay (2003) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 23, pp. 911-912; Seng, W.L., Eng, K., Lee, J., McGrath, P., Use of a monoclonal antibody specific for activated endothelial cells to quantitate angiogenesis in vivo in zebrafish after drug treatment (2004) Angiogenesis, 7, pp. 243-253; McKinley, E.T., Baranowski, T.C., Blavo, D.O., Neuroprotection of MPTP-induced toxicity in zebrafish dopaminergic neurons (2005) Brain Res Mol Brain Res, 141, pp. 128-137; Zhang, J.H., Chung, T.D., Oldenburg, K.R., A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays (1999) J Biomol Screen, 4, pp. 67-73; Schultheiss, C., Blechert, B., Gaertner, F.C., In vivo characterization of endothelial cell activation in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (2006) Angiogenesis, 9, pp. 59-65; Vinals, F., Pouyssequr, J., Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) promotes endothelial cell survival during in vitro angiogenic via an autocrine mechanism implicating TGF-α signaling (2001) Mol Cell Biol, 21, pp. 7218-7230; Milan, D.J., Peterson, T.A., Ruskin, J.N., Peterson, R.T., MacRae, C.A., Drugs that induce repolarization abnormalities cause bradycardia in zebrafish (2003) Circulation, 107, pp. 1355-1358; Hoessel, R., Leclerc, S., Endicott, J.A., Indirubin, the active constituent of a Chinese antileukaemia medicine, inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (1999) Nat Cell Biol, 1, pp. 60-67; Leclerc, S., Garnier, M., Hoessel, R., Indirubins inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 β and CDK5/p25, two protein kinases involved in abnormal tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease.

We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of Dusp6 - (E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3- dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (BCI) - using a transgenic zebrafish chemical screen. BCI treatment blocked Dusp6 activity and enhanced FGF target gene expression in zebrafish embryos. Docking simulations predicted an allosteric binding site for BCI within the phosphatase domain. In vitro studies supported a model in which BCI inhibits Dusp6 catalytic activation by ERK2 substrate binding. We used BCI treatment at varying developmental stages to uncover a temporal role for Dusp6 in restricting cardiac progenitors and controlling heart organ size.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms and discover potential chemical modifiers, we created a zebrafish model of ACM with cardiac myocyte-specific expression of the human 2057del2 mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin. A highthroughput screen identified SB216763 as a suppressor of the disease phenotype. Early SB216763 therapy prevented heart failure and reduced mortality in the fish model. Zebrafish ventricular myocytes that expressed 2057del2 plakoglobin exhibited 70 to 80% reductions in INa and IK1 current densities, which were normalized by SB216763. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes that expressed 2057del2 plakoglobin recapitulated pathobiological features seen in patients with ACM, all of which were reversed or prevented by SB216763. The reverse remodeling observed with SB216763 involved marked subcellular redistribution of plakoglobin, connexin 43, and Nav1.5, but without changes in their total cellular content, implicating a defect in protein trafficking to intercalated discs. In further support of this mechanism, we observed SB216763-reversible, abnormal subcellular distribution of SAP97 (a protein known to mediate forward trafficking of Nav1.5 and Kir2.1) in rat cardiac myocytes expressing 2057del2 plakoglobin and in cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from two ACM probands with plakophilin-2 mutations. These observations pinpoint aberrant trafficking of intercalated disc proteins as a central mechanism in ACM myocyte injury and electrical abnormalities.",,"2 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 3 (1 methyl 3 indolyl)maleimide; cell protein; connexin 43; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir2.1; plakoglobin; protein SAP97; sodium channel Nav1.5; unclassified drug; plakoglobin; zebrafish protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy; article; cardiomyopathy; cellular distribution; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; early intervention; embryo; gene deletion; gene expression; heart failure; heart muscle; heart muscle cell; high throughput screening; intercalated disk; mortality; newborn; nonhuman; pathophysiology; phenotype; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; protein transport; zebra fish; animal; cardiomyopathy; disease model; electrophysiology; heart arrhythmia; metabolism; muscle cell; Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cardiomyopathies; Disease Models, Animal; Electrophysiology; gamma Catenin; Muscle Cells; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",,"2 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 3 (1 methyl 3 indolyl)maleimide, 280744-09-4; gamma Catenin; Zebrafish Proteins","sb 216763",,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL102361, R01HL109264, R01HL113006, R01HL116906, R24HL117756, U01HL099776",,"Basso, C., Corrado, D., Marcus, F.I., Nava, A., Thiene, G., Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (2009) Lancet, 373, pp. 1289-1300; Saffitz, J.E., The pathobiology of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (2011) Annu.

Therapeutic induction of inflammation resolution is an attractive strategy to bring about healing without increasing susceptibility to infection. However, therapeutic targeting of inflammation resolution has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular controls. To address this drug development challenge, we developed an in vivo screen for proresolution therapeutics in a transgenic zebrafish model. Inflammation induced by sterile tissue injury was assessed for accelerated resolution in the presence of a library of known compounds. Of the molecules with proresolution activity, tanshinone IIA, derived from a Chinese medicinal herb, potently induced inflammation resolution in vivo both by induction of neutrophil apoptosis and by promoting reverse migration of neutrophils. Tanshinone IIA blocked proinflammatory signals in vivo, and its effects are conserved in human neutrophils, supporting a potential role in treating human inflammation and providing compelling evidence of the translational potential of this screening strategy.",,"cryptotanshinone; tanshinone IIA; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; article; concentration response; controlled study; drug screening; drug structure; genetic screening; human; human cell; in vivo study; inflammation; leukocyte function; neutrophil chemotaxis; neutrophil count; neutrophil reverse migration; nonhuman; priority journal; transgenic animal; zebra fish; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Diterpenes, Abietane; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Green Fluorescent Proteins; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Inflammation; Larva; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Translational Medical Research; Zebrafish",,"cryptotanshinone, 35825-57-1; tanshinone IIA, 568-72-9",,"Sigma Aldrich","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM092804; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, NIBIB: P41EB002503; Medical Research Council, MRC: G0601156, G0701932, G108/595, MC_PC_12022, MR/K006312/1",,"Serhan, C.N., Savill, J., Resolution of inflammation: The beginning programs the end (2005) Nat.

The success of this process is likely going to be dependent on advances in the synthesis of small molecules having natural product-like structures in an efficient and stereoselective manner. The development, scope, and mechanism of the oxidation of organocuprates was investigated and exploited in the atropdiastereoselective synthesis of biaryl-containing medium rings (9-, 10-, and 11-membered rings). The methodology was performed on high-capacity, large polystyrene beads by metalating aryl bromides with-iPrBu2MgLi, followed by transmetalating with CuCN·2LiBr and then oxidizing with 1,3-dinitrobenzene, and was used in a diversity-oriented synthesis of biaryl-containing medium rings (library total theoretical maximum 1412 members). The high capacity beads were arrayed into 384-well plates and, using a process optimized during the development of a one bead/one stock solution technology platform, converted into arrays of stock solutions, with each stock solution containing largely one compound. These stock solutions were used in numerous phenotypic and proteinbinding assays. The process described outlines a pathway that we feel will contribute to a comprehensive and systematic chemical approach to exploring biology (chemical genetics).",,"Diversity oriented synthesis; Bioassay; Molecular structure; Oxidation; Polystyrenes; Synthesis (chemical); Stereochemistry; 1,3 dinitrobenzene; bromide; copper derivative; lithium derivative; magnesium derivative; organic compound; polymer; polystyrene; article; chemical genetics; chemical reaction; chemical structure; conformation; diastereoisomer; molecule; oxidation; protein binding; stereochemistry; synthesis; technique; technology; Animals; Arabidopsis; Crystallography, X-Ray; Polycyclic Compounds; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Zebrafish",,"1,3 dinitrobenzene, 99-65-0; bromide, 24959-67-9; polystyrene, 9003-53-6; Polycyclic Compounds; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic",,,,,"Schreiber, S.L., (1998) Bioorg.

While normal aging is the single greatest contributor, exposure to environmental toxins and therapeutic drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and antineoplastic agents are significant contributors. Genetic variation contributes markedly to differences in normal disease progression during aging and in susceptibility to ototoxic agents. Using the lateral line system of larval zebrafish, we developed an in vivo drug toxicity interaction screen to uncover genetic modulators of antibiotic-induced hair cell death and to identify compounds that confer protection. We have identified 5 mutations that modulate aminoglycoside susceptibility. Further characterization and identification of one protective mutant, sentinel (snl), revealed a novel conserved vertebrate gene. A similar screen identified a new class of drug-like small molecules, benzothiophene carboxamides, that prevent aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in zebrafish and in mammals. Testing for interaction with the sentinel mutation suggests that the gene and compounds may operate in different pathways. The combination of chemical screening with traditional genetic approaches is a new strategy for identifying drugs and drug targets to attenuate hearing and balance disorders. © 2008 Owens et al.",,"amide; aminoglycoside; antibiotic agent; benzothiopene carboxamide derivative; cisplatin; neomycin; unclassified drug; aminoglycoside; cisplatin; complementary DNA; neomycin; primer DNA; thiophene derivative; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell death; drug exposure; drug response; drug sensitivity; gene; gene identification; gene mutation; hair cell; in vivo study; mammal; mouse; nonhuman; sentinel gene; zebra fish; animal; chemistry; cytology; drug antagonism; drug effect; drug screening; genetic epistasis; genetics; hearing loss; histology; human; nucleotide sequence; pathology; physiology; point mutation; stop codon; vestibule; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Mammalia; Vertebrata; Aminoglycosides; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Death; Cisplatin; Codon, Terminator; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Epistasis, Genetic; Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner; Hearing Loss; Humans; Mice; Neomycin; Point Mutation; Saccule and Utricle; Thiophenes; Zebrafish",,"amide, 17655-31-1; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; neomycin, 11004-65-2, 1404-04-2, 1405-10-3, 8026-22-0; Aminoglycosides; Cisplatin, 15663-27-1; Codon, Terminator; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; Neomycin, 1404-04-2; Thiophenes",,,"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIDCD: F32DC006998, F32DC007244, P30DC004661, R01DC000699, R01DC005987, T32DC000018",,,"Owens, K.

Aster, J.C., Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States","T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC. Here, we performed 2 complementary screens to identify FDA-approved drugs and drug-like small molecules with activity against T-ALL. We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward MYC-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-ALL cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-ALL cells. Using ligand-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a perphenazine target. T-ALL cell lines treated with perphenazine exhibited rapid dephosphorylation of multiple PP2A substrates and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, shRNA knockdown of specific PP2A subunits attenuated perphenazine activity, indicating that PP2A mediates the drug's antileukemic activity. Finally, human T-ALLs treated with perphenazine exhibited suppressed cell growth and dephosphorylation of PP2A targets in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the recurring identification of phenothiazines as a class of drugs with anticancer effects. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic PP2A activation in T-ALL and other cancers driven by hyperphosphorylated PP2A substrates has therapeutic potential. © Copyright 2014 American Society for Clinical Investigation.",,"Animals;

Although it is appreciated that the cilium plays a central role in PKD, the underlying mechanism for PKD remains poorly understood and no effective treatment is available. In zebrafish, kidney cyst formation is closely associated with laterality defects and body curvature. To discover potential drug candidates and dissect signaling pathways that interact with ciliary signals, we performed a chemical modifier screen for the two phenotypes using zebrafish pkd2hi4166 and ift172hi2211 models. pkd2 is a causal gene for autosomal dominant PKD and ift172 is essential for building and maintaining the cilium. We identified trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, as a compound that affected both body curvature and laterality. Further analysis verified that TSA inhibited cyst formation in pkd2 knockdown animals. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibiting class I HDACs, either by valproic acid (VPA), a class I specific HDAC inhibitor structurally unrelated to TSA, or by knocking down hdac1, suppressed kidney cyst formation and body curvature caused by pkd2 deficiency. Finally, we show that VPA was able to reduce the progression of cyst formation and slow the decline of kidney function in a mouse ADPKD model. Together, these data suggest body curvature may be used as a surrogate marker for kidney cyst formation in large-scale high-throughput screens in zebrafish. More importantly, our results also reveal a critical role for HDACs in PKD pathogenesis and point to HDAC inhibitors as drug candidates for PKD treatment.","Chemical suppressor; Zebrafish","histone deacetylase 1;

Although genetic mutations have been useful for identifying some molecular pathways, small molecule probes of regenerative pathways might offer some advantages, including the ability to disrupt pathway function with precise temporal control. However, a vertebrate regeneration model amenable to rapid throughput small molecule screening is not currently available. We report here the development of a zebrafish early life stage fin regeneration model and its use in screening for small molecules that modulate tissue regeneration. By screening 2000 biologically active small molecules, we identified 17 that specifically inhibited regeneration. These compounds include a cluster of glucocorticoids, and we demonstrate that transient activation of the glucocorticoid receptor is sufficient to block regeneration, but only if activation occurs during wound healing/blastema formation. In addition, knockdown of the glucocorticoid receptor restores regenerative capability to nonregenerative, glucocorticoid-exposed zebrafish. To test whether the classical anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids is responsible for blocking regeneration, we prevented acute inflammation following amputation by antisense repression of the Pu.1 gene. Although loss of Pu.1 prevents the inflammatory response, regeneration is not affected. Collectively, these results indicate that signaling from exogenous glucocorticoids impairs blastema formation and limits regenerative capacity through an acute inflammation-independent mechanism. These studies also demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting chemical genetics to define the pathways that govern vertebrate regeneration. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cells; Drug products; Genetic engineering; Mutagenesis; Chemical genetics; Glucocorticoid; Molecule screening; Temporal control; Tissue engineering; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; transcription factor PU 1; animal experiment; article; blastema; chemical genetics; controlled study; embryo; gene mutation; inflammation; male; molecular genetics; nonhuman; priority journal; tissue regeneration; wound healing; zebra fish; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Extremities; Genetic Techniques; Glucocorticoids; Macrophages; Male; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Neutrophils; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Danio rerio; Vertebrata",,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Glucocorticoids",,,"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS: P30ES000210, P50ES003850, R01ES010820; Medical Research Council, MRC: G108/595",,"Ding, S., Schultz, P.G., (2004) Nat.

In this highly prevalent form of anemia, inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, stimulate hepatic expression of hepcidin, which negatively regulates iron bioavailability by inactivating ferroportin. Hepcidin is transcriptionally regulated by IL-6 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We hypothesized that inhibiting BMP signaling can reduce hepcidin expression and ameliorate hypoferremia and anemia associated with inflammation. In human hepatoma cells, IL-6-induced hepcidin expression, an effect that was inhibited by treatment with a BMP type I receptor inhibitor, LDN-193189, or BMP ligand antagonists noggin and ALK3-Fc. In zebrafish, the induction of hepcidin expression by transgenic expression of IL-6 was also reduced by LDN-193189. In mice, treatment with IL-6 or turpentine increased hepcidin expression and reduced serum iron, effects that were inhibited by LDN-193189 or ALK3-Fc. Chronic turpentine treatment led to microcytic anemia, which was prevented by concurrent administration of LDN-193189 or attenuated when LDN-193189 was administered after anemia was established. Our studies support the concept that BMP and IL-6 act together to regulate iron homeostasis and suggest that inhibition of BMP signaling may be an effective strategy for the treatment of anemia of inflammation. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1; hepcidin; interleukin 6; iron; ldn 193189; noggin; protein inhibitor; turpentine; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; disease association; drug activity; hepatoma cell; human; human cell; hypoferremia; inflammation; microcytic anemia; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein defect; protein expression; signal transduction",,"hepcidin, 342809-17-0, 1356390-47-0, 2222618-29-1; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; turpentine, 9005-90-7","ldn 193189",,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K08HL079943, R01HL097794; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: K01DK065635, R01DK082722, R01DK082971; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS: R01AR057374",,"Nicolas, G., Bennoun, M., Porteu, A., Mativet, S., Beaumont, C., Grandchamp, B., Sirito, M., Vaulont, S., Severe iron deficiency anemia in transgenic mice expressing liver hepcidin (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99 (7), pp. 4596-4601. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.072632499; Sasu, B.J., Cooke, K.S., Arvedson, T.L., Antihepcidin antibody treatment modulates iron metabolism and is effective in a mouse model of inflammation-induced anemia (2010) Blood, 115 (17), pp. 3616-3624; Weiss, G., Goodnough, L.T., Anemia of chronic disease (2005) N Engl J Med, 352 (10), pp. 1011-1023; Beutel, G., Ganser, A., Risks and Benefits of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents in Cancer Management (2007) Seminars in Hematology, 44 (3), pp. 157-165. , DOI 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.04.004, PII S0037196307000674, Hamtopoietic Growth Factors; Al-Ahmad, A., Rand, W.M., Manjunath, G., Konstam, M.A., Salem, D.N., Levey, A.S., Sarnak, M.J., Reduced kidney function and anemia as risk factors for mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (2001) Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 38 (4), pp. 955-962. , DOI 10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01470-X, PII S073510970101470X; Eckardt, K.U., Anaemia in end-stage renal disease: Pathophysiological considerations (2001) Nephrol Dial Transplant, 16 (SUPPL. 7), pp. 2-8; Mann, J.F.E., What are the short-term and long-term consequences of anaemia in CRF patients?

We report the automated dechorionation of 1600 embryos at once at 4 h postfertilization (hpf) and placement of the dechorionated embryos into 96-well plates for exposure by 6 hpf. The process removed ≥95% of the embryos from their chorions with 2% embryo mortality by 24 hpf, and 2% of the embryos malformed at 120 hpf. The robotic embryo placement allocated 6-hpf embryos to 94.7% ± 4.2% of the wells in multiple 96-well trials. The rate of embryo mortality was 2.8% (43 of 1536) from robotic handling, the rate of missed wells was 1.2% (18 of 1536), and the frequency of multipicks was <0.1%. Embryo malformations observed at 24 hpf occurred nearly twice as frequently from robotic handling (16 of 864; 1.9%) as from manual pipetting (9 of 864; 1%).

To identify new regulators of whole-body energy control, we conducted a high-throughput screen in transgenic reporter zebrafish for small molecules that modulate the expression of the fasting-inducible gluconeogenic gene pck1. We show that this in vivo strategy identified several drugs that affect gluconeogenesis in humans as well as metabolically uncharacterized compounds. Most notably, we find that the translocator protein ligands PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 are glucose-lowering agents despite a strong inductive effect on pck1 expression. We show that these drugs are activators of a fasting-like energy state and, notably, that they protect high-fat diet-induced obese mice from hepatosteatosis and glucose intolerance, two pathological manifestations of metabolic dysregulation. Thus, using a whole-organism screening strategy, this study has identified new small-molecule activators of fasting metabolism. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

Here we present an automated high-throughput system for measuring nonassociative learning behaviors in larval zebrafish. Using this system, we report that spaced training blocks of repetitive visual stimuli elicit protein synthesis-dependent long-term habituation in larval zebrafish, lasting up to 24 h. Moreover, repetitive acoustic stimulation induces robust short-term habituation that can be modulated by stimulation frequency and instantaneously dishabituated through cross-modal stimulation. To characterize the neurochemical pathways underlying short-term habituation, we screened 1,760 bioactive compounds with known targets. Although we found extensive functional conservation of short-term learning between larval zebrafish and mammalian models, we also discovered several compounds with previously unknown roles in learning. These compounds included a myristic acid analog known to interact with Src family kinases and an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase 2, demonstrating that high-throughput chemical screens combined with high-resolution behavioral assays provide a powerful approach for the discovery of novel cognitive modulators.","Acoustic startle response; Sensorimotor gating","cyclin dependent kinase 2 inhibitor; protein tyrosine kinase; article; auditory stimulation; habituation; larval stage; long term memory; nonhuman; priority journal; protein synthesis; short term memory; visual stimulation; zebra fish; Acoustic Stimulation; Animals; Habituation, Psychophysiologic; Larva; Latency Period (Psychology); Mammals; Memory; Photic Stimulation; Protein Biosynthesis; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Small Molecule Libraries; Startle Reaction; Time Factors; Zebrafish; Danio rerio; Mammalia",,"protein tyrosine kinase, 80449-02-1; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Small Molecule Libraries",,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R01MH092257; National Eye Institute, NEI: F32EY019434",,"Christoffersen, G.R., Habituation: Events in the history of its characterization and linkage to synaptic depression.

After screening 26 400 molecules, we identified Lenaldekar (LDK), a compound that eliminates immature T cells in developing zebrafish without affecting the cell cycle in other cell types. LDK is well tolerated in vertebrates and induces longterm remission in adult zebrafish withcMYC-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).LDKcauses dephosphorylation of members of the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and delays sensitive cells in late mitosis.Among human cancers, LDK selectively affects survival of hematopoietic malignancy lines and primary leukemias, including therapy-refractory B-ALL and chronic myelogenous leukemia samples, and inhibits growth of human T-ALL xenografts. This work demonstrates the utility of our method using zebrafish for antineoplastic candidate drug identification and suggests a new approach for targeted leukemia therapy. Although our efforts focused on leukemia therapy, this screening approach has broad implications as it can be translated to other cancer types involving malignant degeneration of developmentally arrested cells. © 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"1h indole 3 carbaldehyde 8 quinolinylhydrazone; antileukemic agent; imatinib; Myc protein; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; cancer inhibition; cell cycle; cell maturation; cell survival; chronic myeloid leukemia; concentration response; controlled study; drug blood level; drug half life; drug identification; drug screening; embryo; human; IC 50; leukemia cell; male; mitosis; molecular library; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein dephosphorylation; T lymphoblast; toxicity; tumor xenograft; zebra fish",,"imatinib, 152459-95-5, 220127-57-1; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6",,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: P30CA042014, R01CA116468, R01CA137060",,"Stat Fact Sheets: Leukemia, , http://www.seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/leuks.html, National Cancer Institute, Available at Accessed December 10, 2011; Smith, M.A., Gloeckler Ries, L.A., Gurney, J.G., Ross, J.A., Leukemia.

Despite improvements in standard treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, many patients still progress to advanced stages. Recent clinical trials have shown encouraging results regarding the application of angiogenic inhibitors in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases, paving the way for novel PCa therapies. Objective: To identify new antiangiogenic compounds and examine their therapeutic potential in models of PCa. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a chemical genetic screen in developing zebrafish embryos to identify small molecules inhibiting zebrafish angiogenesis. Transgenic Tg(flk1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos were used in the screening of the Spectrum Collection compound library. Subsequently, the antiangiogenic mechanism of an identified lead compound, rosuvastatin, was studied by conducting endothelial cell function assays and examining antitumor efficacy in a PCa xenograft mouse model. Measurements, results and limitations: Seven lead compounds, including isorotenone, dihydromunduletone, aristolochic acid, simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin, were identified to inhibit the growth of the zebrafish intersegmental vessels. Of these seven leads, rosuvastatin was further evaluated for its antiangiogenic mechanism and anticancer efficacy. Rosuvastatin decreased the viability of the human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) (one-half inhibitory concentration: 5.87 μM) by inducing G1 phase arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, rosuvastatin remarkably inhibited the migration of HUVECs and dose-dependently inhibited the HUVEC capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rosuvastatin suppressed xenografted PPC-1 prostate tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice associated with decreased microvessel density (MVD) and tumor cell apoptosis. Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that rosuvastatin possesses antiangiogenic and antitumor activities and has therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa. This study represents the first zebrafish antiangiogenic chemical genetic screen to identify a lead compound that targets cancer angiogenesis. © 2010 European Association of Urology.

Recently, we and others have shown that customized zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) can introduce targeted frame-shift mutations with high efficiency, thereby enabling directed creation of zebrafish gene mutations. Here we describe a detailed protocol for constructing ZFN expression vectors, for generating and introducing ZFN-encoding RNAs into zebrafish embryos and for identifying ZFN-generated mutations in targeted genomic sites. All of our vectors and methods are compatible with previously described Zinc-Finger Consortium reagents for constructing engineered zinc-finger arrays. Using these methods, zebrafish founders carrying targeted mutations can be identified within 4 months. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group.",,"DNA fragment; genomic DNA; nuclease; plasmid DNA; restriction endonuclease; zinc finger protein; article; DNA isolation; DNA sequence; expression vector; gene expression regulation; genetic engineering; mutagenesis; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; restriction site; somatic mutation; zebra fish; Animals; Deoxyribonucleases; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Frameshift Mutation; Genetic Vectors; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Engineering; Restriction Mapping; Zebrafish; Zinc Fingers; Danio rerio",,"nuclease, 9026-81-7; Deoxyribonucleases, 3.1.-",,,"AG031300; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA: K01AG031300; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R21HL091808; NIH Office of the Director, OD: DP1OD006862; National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA118498, R01CA140188; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM069906, R01GM088040; National Center for Research Resources, NCRR: R21RR024189","acknowleDGMents We thank Dr. A.J.

Recent work has demonstrated that a zebrafish model of LQT syndrome faithfully recapitulates several features of human disease, including prolongation of ventricular action potential duration, spontaneous early afterdepolarizations, and 2:1 atrioventricular block in early stages of development. Because of their transparency, small size, and absorption of small molecules from their environment, zebrafish are amenable to high-throughput chemical screens. We describe a small-molecule screen using the zebrafish KCNH2 mutant breakdance to identify compounds that can rescue the LQT type 2 phenotype. Methods and results-: Zebrafish breakdance embryos were exposed to test compounds at 48 hours of development and scored for rescue of 2:1 atrioventricular block at 72 hours in a 96-well format. Only compounds that suppressed the LQT phenotype in 3 of 3 fish were considered hits. Screen compounds were obtained from commercially available small-molecule libraries (Prestwick and Chembridge). Initial hits were confirmed with dose-response testing and time-course studies. Optical mapping with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4 ANEPPS was performed to measure compound effects on cardiac action potential durations. Screening of 1200 small molecules resulted in the identification of flurandrenolide and 2-methoxy-N-(4-methylphenyl) benzamide (2-MMB) as compounds that reproducibly suppressed the LQT phenotype. Optical mapping confirmed that treatment with each compound caused shortening of ventricular action potential durations. Structure activity studies and steroid receptor knockdown suggest that flurandrenolide functions via the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. Conclusions-: Using a zebrafish model of LQT type 2 syndrome in a high-throughput chemical screen, we have identified 2 compounds, flurandrenolide and the novel compound 2-MMB, as small molecules that rescue the zebrafish LQT type 2 syndrome by shortening the ventricular action potential duration. We provide evidence that flurandrenolide functions via the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway. These 2 molecules and future discoveries from this screen should yield novel tools for the study of cardiac electrophysiology and may lead to novel therapeutics for human LQT patients.

In the human retina, both an excess and a deficiency of blood vessels may lead to a loss of vision. To gain insight into the molecular basis of vessel formation in the vertebrate retina and to develop pharmacological means of manipulating this process in a living organism, we further characterized the embryonic zebrafish eye vasculature, and performed a small molecule screen for compounds that affect blood vessel morphogenesis. The screening of approximately 2000 compounds revealed four small molecules that at specific concentrations affect retinal vessel morphology but do not produce obvious changes in trunk vessels, or in the neuronal architecture of the retina. Of these, two induce a pronounced widening of vessel diameter without a substantial loss of vessel number, one compound produces a loss of retinal blood vessels accompanied by a mild increase of their diameter, and finally one other generates a severe loss of retinal vessels. This work demonstrates the utility of zebrafish as a screening tool for small molecules that affect eye vasculature and presents several compounds of potential therapeutic importance. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Identification of chemicals with the potential to enhance this reactivation could therapeutically promote kidney regeneration. Here, we found that 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid (PTBA) expanded the expression domains of molecular markers of kidney organogenesis in zebrafish. PTBA exhibits structural and functional similarity to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors 4-phenylbutanoic acid and trichostatin A; treatment with these HDAC inhibitors also expanded the renal progenitor cell population. Analyses in vitro and in vivo confirmed that PTBA functions as an inhibitor of HDAC activity. Furthermore, PTBA-mediated renal progenitor cell expansion required retinoic acid signaling. In summary, these results support a mechanistic link among renal progenitor cells, HDAC, and the retinoid pathway. Whether PTBA holds promise as a therapeutic agent to promote renal regeneration requires further study.

We conducted a chemical screen to identify compounds that would induce the differentiation of insulin-producing β-cells in vivo. To do this screen, we brought together the use of transgenic zebrafish as a model of β-cell differentiation, a unique multiwell plate that allows easy visualization of lateral views of swimming larval fish and a library of clinical drugs. We identified six hits that can induce precocious differentiation of secondary islets in larval zebrafish. Three of these six hits were known drugs with a considerable background of published data on mechanism of action. Using pharmacological approaches, we have identified and characterized two unique pathways in β-cell differentiation in the zebrafish, including down-regulation of GTP production and retinoic acid biosynthesis.","Development; Embryogenesis; Notch-signaling; Progenitor","disulfiram; epirizole; esculin; guanosine triphosphate; inosinate dehydrogenase inhibitor; levallorphan; mycophenolic acid; Notch receptor; retinoic acid; sulfanilic acid; transcription factor PDX 1; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell level; controlled study; drug approval; drug determination; drug library; drug mechanism; drug screening; embryo; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; larva; library; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; signal transduction; vitamin metabolism; zebra fish; Acetanilides; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Caffeic Acids; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; DNA Primers; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Discovery; Epirizole; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Guanosine Triphosphate; HMGB1 Protein; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Larva; Microscopy, Confocal; Mycophenolic Acid; p-Aminoazobenzene; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sulfanilic Acids; Tretinoin; Zebrafish",,"disulfiram, 97-77-8; epirizole, 18694-40-1; esculin, 531-75-9; guanosine triphosphate, 86-01-1; levallorphan, 13075-35-9, 152-02-3; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1; retinoic acid, 302-79-4; sulfanilic acid, 121-57-3, 515-74-2; Acetanilides; C.I.

However, current optogenetic approaches are limited to transgenic systems expressing microbial opsins and other exogenous photoreceptors. Here, we identify optovin, a small molecule that enables repeated photoactivation of motor behaviors in wild-type zebrafish and mice. To our surprise, optovin's behavioral effects are not visually mediated. Rather, photodetection is performed by sensory neurons expressing the cation channel TRPA1. TRPA1 is both necessary and sufficient for the optovin response. Optovin activates human TRPA1 via structure-dependent photochemical reactions with redox-sensitive cysteine residues. In animals with severed spinal cords, optovin treatment enables control of motor activity in the paralyzed extremities by localized illumination. These studies identify a light-based strategy for controlling endogenous TRPA1 receptors in vivo, with potential clinical and research applications in nontransgenic animals, including humans. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

Accordingly, the intrinsic complexity of the cell-matrix-cell interactions of the NVU has made analyzing gene function in cell culture, tissue explants, and even animal models difficult and the inability to study gene function in the BBB in vivo has been a critical hurdle to advancing BBB research.Zebrafish has emerged as a premier vertebrate organism to model and analyze complex cellular interactions in vivo and genetic mechanisms of embryonic development. To this end, we provide a technical overview of the procedures that can be used in Zebrafish to analyze BBB integrity with a focus on the cerebrovasculature of adult fish where the BBB is now defined. The techniques that are used to measure the functional integrity, the cell biology, and the ultrastructure of the BBB include permeability assays, fluorescent imaging of reporter genes, and electron microscopy, respectively. Each can be applied to the functional analysis of mutant fish in ways that characterize the molecular sequelae to pathological insults that compromise BBB integrity. Due to the highly conserved nature of both the genetics and cell biology of zebrafish when compared with higher vertebrates, drug discovery techniques can be used in zebrafish models to complement drug development studies in other model systems.",,"animal; animal model; article; blood brain barrier; cytology; endothelium cell; metabolism; permeability; physiology; zebra fish; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Endothelial Cells; Models, Animal; Permeability; Zebrafish",,,,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL073396; National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA170140; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: P20GM078421; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R21NS058776",,,"Eliceiri, B.P.",,,,,,,,19406029,,,"21082382","English","Methods Mol.

While the split - pool synthetic method is theoretically the most effective approach for the production of large collections of small molecules, it has not been widely adopted due to numerous technical and analytical hurdles. We have developed a split-pool synthesis leading to an array of stock solutions of single 1,3-dioxanes. The quantities of compounds are sufficient for hundreds of phenotypic and protein-binding assays. The average concentration of these stock solutions derived from a single synthesis bead was determined to be 5.4 mM in 5 μL of DMSO. A mass spectrometric strategy to identify the structure of molecules from a split-pool synthesis was shown to be highly accurate. Individual members of the 1,3-dioxane library have activity in a variety of phenotypic and protein-binding assays. The procedure developed in this study allows many assays to be performed with compounds derived from individual synthesis beads.

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying novel inhibitors of intestinal lipid absorption using the zebrafish system. A pilot screen of an unbiased chemical library identified novel compounds that inhibited processing of fluorescent lipid analogues in live zebrafish larvae. Secondary assays identified those compounds suitable for testing in mammals and provided insight into mechanism of action, which for several compounds could be distinguished from ezetimibe, a drug used to inhibit cholesterol absorption in humans that broadly inhibited lipid absorption in zebrafish larvae. These findings support the utility of zebrafish screening assays to identify novel compounds that target complex physiological processes. © 2010 Clifton et al.",,"antilipemic agent; atorvastatin; cholesterol derivative; clofazimine; ezetimibe; long chain fatty acid; phospholipid derivative; proteinase; tetrahydrolipstatin; azetidine derivative; cholesterol; drug derivative; ezetimibe; fatty acid; fluorescent dye; phospholipid; article; cholesterol metabolism; controlled study; dose response; drug determination; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug screening; embryo; endocytosis; enzyme activity; enzyme mechanism; fat intake; fatty acid metabolism; fluorescence analysis; in vivo study; larval stage; lipid absorption; lipid analysis; nonhuman; zebra fish; absorption; animal; chemistry; fat intake; feasibility study; human; larva; lipid metabolism; metabolism; molecular library; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Mammalia; Absorption; Animals; Azetidines; Cholesterol; Dietary Fats; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Endocytosis; Fatty Acids; Feasibility Studies; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Larva; Lipid Metabolism; Phospholipids; Small Molecule Libraries; Zebrafish",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; clofazimine, 2030-63-9; ezetimibe, 163222-33-1; proteinase, 9001-92-7; tetrahydrolipstatin, 96829-58-2; cholesterol, 57-88-5; Azetidines; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Dietary Fats; Fatty Acids; Fluorescent Dyes; Phospholipids; Small Molecule Libraries; ezetimibe, 163222-33-1",,,"National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI: U54HG003915; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM063904; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: R01DK054942",,"Kiortsis, D.N., Filippatos, T.D., Elisaf, M.S., The effects of orlistat on metabolic parameters and other cardiovascular risk factors (2005) Diabetes Metab, 31, pp. 15-22; Nakou, E.S., Filippatos, T.D., Kiortsis, D.N., Derdemezis, C.S., Tselepis, A.D., The effects of ezetimibe and orlistat, alone or in combination, on highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses and HDL-associated enzyme activities in overweight and obese patients with hyperlipidaemia (2008) Expert Opin Pharmacother, 9, pp. 3151-3158; Nakou, E.S., Filippatos, T.D., Georgoula, M., Kiortsis, D.N., Tselepis, A.D., The effect of orlistat and ezetimibe, alone or in combination, on serum LDL and small dense LDL cholesterol levels in overweight and obese patients with hypercholesterolaemia (2008) Curr Med Res Opin, 24, pp. 1919-1929; Athyros, V.G., Tziomalos, K., Kakafika, A.I., Koumaras, H., Karagiannis, A., Effectiveness of ezetimibe alone or in combination with twice a week Atorvastatin (10 mg) for statin intolerant high-risk patients (2008) Am J Cardiol, 101, pp. 483-485; Dujovne, C.A., Ettinger, M.P., McNeer, J.F., Lipka, L.J., Lebeaut, A.P., Efficacy and safety of a potent new selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (2002) Am J Cardiol, 90, pp. 1092-1097; Kastelein, J.J., Akdim, K., Stroes, E.S., Zwinderman, A.H., Bots, M.L., Simvastatin with or without ezetimibe in familial hyper-cholesterolemia (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1431-1443; Brown, B.G., Taylor, A.J., Does ENHANCE diminish confidence in lowering LDL or in ezetimibe?

The majority of the compounds demonstrated vasorelaxation action on 60 mM KCl-induced contractions rat isolated aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner, and the action is mediated by both endothelium-independent and endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Compounds 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 19 showed higher vasorelaxation activities comparing with the lead compound 3. In addition, these derivatives had potential protective action against oxLDL-induced endothelial oxidative injury and enhanced NO production in HUVECs without toxic effects. The NO release was completely inhibited by eNOS inhibitor L-NAME. Furthermore, 3 significantly promoted the angiogenesis in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner at 0.1, 1, and 10 μM. Compounds 9, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 21 exhibited stronger angiogenic activities than 3. Therefore, xyloketal derivatives are unique compounds with multiple pharmacological properties and may have potential implications in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"cardiovascular agent; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; nitric oxide; unclassified drug; xyloketal a; xyloketal b; xyloketal c; xyloketal d; xyloketal h; angiogenesis; animal tissue; article; cell damage; cell viability; controlled study; drug design; drug synthesis; embryo; endothelium cell; human; human cell; nonhuman; rat; structure activity relation; thoracic aorta; vasodilatation; zebra fish; Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Animals; Aorta, Thoracic; Cell Survival; Drug Design; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Vascular; Lipoproteins, LDL; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Nitric Oxide; Pyrans; Rats; Structure-Activity Relationship; Vasodilator Agents; Zebrafish",,"n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester, 50903-99-6; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Lipoproteins, LDL; Nitric Oxide, 10102-43-9; Pyrans; Vasodilator Agents; oxidized low density lipoprotein; xyloketal A; xyloketal B",,,,,"Schwartz, C.J., Valente, A.J., Sprague, E.A., Kelley, J.L., Nerem, R.M., The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis: An overview (1991) Clin.

Yet animal studies remain too slow and their analyses are often limited to only a few readouts. Here we demonstrate high-throughput optical projection tomography with micrometre resolution and hyperdimensional screening of entire vertebrates in tens of seconds using a simple fluidic system. Hundreds of independent morphological features and complex phenotypes are automatically captured in three dimensions with unprecedented speed and detail in semitransparent zebrafish larvae. By clustering quantitative phenotypic signatures, we can detect and classify even subtle alterations in many biological processes simultaneously. We term our approach hyperdimensional in vivo phenotyping. To illustrate the power of hyperdimensional in vivo phenotyping, we have analysed the effects of several classes of teratogens on cartilage formation using 200 independent morphological measurements, and identified similarities and differences that correlate well with their known mechanisms of actions in mammals. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"alitretinoin; cyclopamine; flusilazole; isotretinoin; retinoic acid; retinol; teratogenic agent; triadimefon; biological development; cyprinid; cytology; genetic analysis; image resolution; larva; morphology; mutation; optical method; phenotype; tomography; vertebrate; article; cartilage; high throughput screening; hyperdimensional in vivo phenotyping; in vivo study; larva; mammal; nonhuman; phenotype; quantitative analysis; zebra fish; Animals; Bone and Bones; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Larva; Phenotype; Teratogens; Tomography; Vertebrates; Zebrafish",,"alitretinoin, 5300-03-8; cyclopamine, 4449-51-8; flusilazole, 85509-19-9; isotretinoin, 4759-48-2; retinoic acid, 302-79-4; retinol, 68-26-8, 82445-97-4; triadimefon, 43121-43-3; Teratogens",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHMI; NIH Office of the Director, OD: DP2OD002989; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM095672; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R01NS073127; Broad Institute","We thank the following funding sources: NIH Transformative Research Award (R01 NS073127), NIH (R01 GM095672), NIH Director’s New Innovator award (1-DP2- OD002989), Packard award in Science and Engineering, Sparc Grant from the Broad Institute and the HHMI International Student Fellowship.

Current therapies for delaying unwanted ocular angiogenesis include laser surgery or molecular inhibition of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. However, targeting of angiogenic pathways other than, or in combination to VEGF, may lead to more effective and safer inhibitors of intraocular angiogenesis. In a small chemical screen using zebrafish, we identify LY294002 as an effective and selective inhibitor of both developmental and ectopic hyaloid angiogenesis in the eye. LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, exerts its anti-angiogenic effect in a dose-dependent manner, without perturbing existing vessels. Significantly, LY294002 delivered by intraocular injection, significantly inhibits ocular angiogenesis without systemic side-effects and without diminishing visual function. Thus, targeting of PI3 kinase pathways has the potential to effectively and safely treat neovascularisation in eye disease. © 2009 Alvarez et al.",,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; vasculotropin; 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; chromone derivative; enzyme inhibitor; morpholine derivative; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; vasculotropin A; antiangiogenic activity; article; controlled study; dose response; drug efficacy; drug targeting; embryo; nonhuman; protein targeting; retina neovascularization; zebra fish; animal; anoxia; electroretinography; gene expression regulation; IC 50; metabolism; methodology; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; prenatal development; retina; retina blood vessel; time; Danio rerio; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Animals; Anoxia; Chromones; Electroretinography; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Morpholines; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Retina; Retinal Vessels; Time Factors; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Zebrafish",,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone, 154447-36-6; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; vasculotropin, 127464-60-2; vasculotropin A, 489395-96-2; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, 2.7.1.137; 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 154447-36-6; Chromones; Enzyme Inhibitors; Morpholines; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","ly 294002, Sigma","Sigma",,,"Frank, R.N., Diabetic retinopathy (2004) N Engl J Med, 350 (1), pp. 48-58; Jager, R.D., Mieler, W.F., Miller, J.W., Age-related macular degeneration (2008) N Engl J Med, 358 (24), pp. 2606-2617; Pierce, E.A., Foley, E.D., Smith, L.E., Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by oxygen in a model of retinopathy of prematurity (1996) Arch Ophthalmol, 114 (10), pp. 1219-1228; Hernandez, C., Simo, R., Strategies for blocking angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy: From basic science to clinical practice (2007) Expert Opin Investig Drugs, 16 (8), pp. 1209-1226; Avery RL, Pieramici DJ, Rabena MD, Castellarin AA, Nasir MA, et al.

Although several in vitro studies have been carried out to identify modulators of beta-cell mass expansion, restoring endogenous beta-cell mass in vivo has yet to be achieved. To identify potential stimulators of beta-cell replication in vivo, we established transgenic zebrafish lines that monitor and allow the quantification of cell proliferation by using the fluorescent ubiquitylation-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) technology. Using these new reagents, we performed an unbiased chemical screen, and identified 20 small molecules that markedly increased beta-cell proliferation in vivo. Importantly, these structurally distinct molecules, which include clinically-approved drugs, modulate three specific signaling pathways: serotonin, retinoic acid and glucocorticoids, showing the high sensitivity and robustness of our screen. Notably, two drug classes, retinoic acid and glucocorticoids, also promoted beta-cell regeneration after beta-cell ablation. Thus, this study establishes a proof of principle for a high-throughput small molecule-screen for beta-cell proliferation in vivo, and identified compounds that stimulate beta-cell proliferation and regeneration. © 2014 Tsuji et al.",,"molecular library; retinoic acid; trazodone; animal; cell cycle; cell proliferation; drug effects; drug screening; high throughput screening; metabolism; molecular library; pancreas islet beta cell; regeneration; transgenic animal; ubiquitination; zebra fish; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Regeneration; Small Molecule Libraries; Trazodone; Tretinoin; Ubiquitination; Zebrafish",,"retinoic acid, 302-79-4; trazodone, 19794-93-5, 25332-39-2; Small Molecule Libraries; Trazodone; Tretinoin",,,"R01 DK075032, U01 DK089541; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: R01DK075032, U01DK089541",,"Butler, A.E., Janson, J., Bonner-Weir, S., Ritzel, R., Rizza, R.A., Butler, P.C., beta-cell deficit and increased beta-cell apoptosis in humans with type 2 diabetes (2003) Diabetes, 52 (1), pp. 102-110. , DOI 10.2337/diabetes.52.1.102; Wajchenberg, B.L., beta-cell failure in diabetes and preservation by clinical treatment (2007) Endocr Rev, 28, pp. 187-218; Borowiak, M., Melton, D.A., How to make beta cells?

Of the 1680 compounds evaluated, we identified two enhancers and six inhibitors of regeneration. The two enhancers, dexamethasone and prednisolone, are synthetic glucocorticoids that potentiated hair cell numbers during regeneration and also induced hair cell addition in the absence of damage. BrdU analysis confirmed that the extra hair cells arose from mitotic activity. We found that dexamethasone and prednisolone, like other glucocorticoids, suppress zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, indicating that hair cell regeneration occurs by a distinctly different process. Further analyses of the regeneration inhibitors revealed that two of the six, flubendazole and topotecan, significantly suppress hair cell regeneration by preventing proliferation of hair cell precursors. Flubendazole halted support cell division in M-phase, possibly by interfering with normal microtubule activity. Topotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor, killed both hair cells and proliferating hair cell precursors. A third inhibitor, fulvestrant, moderately delayed hair cell regeneration by reducing support cell proliferation. Our observation that hair cells do not regenerate when support cell proliferation is impeded confirms previous observations that cell division is the primary route for hair cell regeneration after neomycin treatment in zebrafish. © 2012 the authors.",,"artesunate; broxuridine; dexamethasone; dipyridamole; fenoprofen; flubendazole; fulvestrant; neomycin; prednisolone; topotecan; animal cell; article; cell proliferation; cell regeneration; controlled study; dose response; embryo; hair cell; immunohistochemistry; lateral line system; nonhuman; precursor; priority journal; zebra fish; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Death; Estradiol; Glucocorticoids; Hair Cells, Auditory; Lateral Line System; Mebendazole; Mechanoreceptors; Neomycin; Nerve Regeneration; Neural Inhibition; Stem Cells; Topotecan; Zebrafish",,"artesunate, 82864-68-4, 88495-63-0; broxuridine, 59-14-3; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; dipyridamole, 58-32-2; fenoprofen, 29679-58-1, 31879-05-7, 34691-31-1; flubendazole, 31430-15-6; fulvestrant, 129453-61-8; neomycin, 11004-65-2, 1404-04-2, 1405-10-3, 8026-22-0; prednisolone, 50-24-8; topotecan, 119413-54-6, 123948-87-8; Estradiol, 50-28-2; Glucocorticoids; Mebendazole, 31431-39-7; Neomycin, 1404-04-2; Topotecan, 123948-87-8; flubendazole, 31430-15-6; fulvestrant, 129453-61-8",,,"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIDCD: P30DC004661, R01DC011269",,"Adler, H.J., Raphael, Y., New hair cells arise from supporting cell conversion in the acoustically damaged chick inner ear (1996) Neurosci Lett, 205, pp. 17-20; Baird, R.A., Steyger, P.S., Schuff, N.R., Mitotic and nonmitotic hair cell regeneration in the bullfrog vestibular otolith organs (1996) Ann N Y Acad Sci, 781, pp. 59-70; Baird, R.A., Burton, M.D., Lysakowski, A., Fashena, D.S., Naeger, R.A., Hair cell recovery in mitotically blocked cultures of the bullfrog saccule (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 97, pp. 11722-11729; Bhave, S.A., Oesterle, E.C., Coltrera, M.D., Macrophage and microglia-like cells in the avian inner ear (1998) J Comp Neurol, 398, pp. 241-256; Breuskin, I., Bodson, M., Thelen, N., Thiry, M., Nguyen, L., Belachew, S., Lefebvre, P.P., Malgrange, B., Strategies to regenerate hair cells: Identification of progenitors and critical genes (2008) Hear Res, 236, pp. 1-10; Brigande, J.V., Heller, S., Quo vadis, hair cell regeneration?

The need for novel small molecule modulators of biological processes has driven a number of targeted screens on large diverse libraries. However, due to the specific focus of such screens, the majority of the bioactive potential of these libraries remains unharnessed. In order to identify a higher proportion of compounds with interesting biological activities, we screened a diverse synthetic library for compounds that perturb the development of any of the multiple organs in zebrafish embryos. We identified small molecules that affect the development of a variety of structures such as heart, vasculature, brain, and body-axis. We utilized the previously known role of retinoic acid in anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning to identify the target of DTAB, a compound that caused A-P axis shortening in the zebrafish embryo. We show that DTAR is a retinoid with selective activity towards retinoic acid receptors γ and β. Thus, conducting zebrafish developmental screens using small molecules will not only enable the identification of compounds with diverse biological activities in a large chemical library but may also facilitate the identification of the target pathways of these biologically active molecules. © 2008 Sachidanandan et al.",,"3 [(4,6 diphenoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl)amino]benzoic acid);

In a zebrafish-based invivo screen for small molecules that specifically perturb embryonic dorsoventral patterning, we discovered a compound named windorphen that selectively blocks the Wnt signal required for ventral development. Windorphen exhibits remarkable specificity toward β-catenin-1 function, indicating that the two β-catenin isoforms found in zebrafish are not functionally redundant. We show that windorphen is a selective inhibitor of p300 histone acetyltransferase, a coactivator that associates with β-catenin.

We hypothesized that operative pathways during embryogenesis would also be used for oncogenesis. In an effort to define RAS target genes during embryogenesis, gene expression was evaluated in Tg(hsp70-HRASG12V) zebrafish embryos subjected to heat shock. dusp6 was activated by RAS, and this was used as the basis for a chemical genetic screen to identify small molecules that interfere with RAS signaling during embryogenesis. A KRASG12D-induced zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was then used to assess the therapeutic effects of the small molecules. Two of these inhibitors, PD98059 and TPCK, had anti-tumor activity as single agents in both zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and a human cell line of rhabdomyosarcoma that harbored activated mutations in NRAS. PD98059 inhibited MEK1 whereas TPCK suppressed S6K1 activity; however, the combined treatment completely suppressed eIF4B phosphorylation and decreased translation initiation. Our work demonstrates that the activated pathways in RAS induction during embryogenesis are also important in oncogenesis and that inhibition of these pathways suppresses tumor growth. © 2013.

Two compounds, budesonide and AGN192403, abrogated fin regeneration. One compound in particular, AGN192403, targets the imidazoline receptor, a pathway not previously linked to fin regeneration. In addition to inhibiting regeneration of the adult fin, AGN192403 also blocked regeneration of the larval fin fold. Finally, the inhibitory effect of AGN192403 on fin regeneration persisted after removal of the drug. These studies demonstrate that chemical screening is feasible in adult zebrafish and that it is a reasonable strategy to use for exploring the biology of regeneration. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"budesonide; animal; article; cell proliferation; drug effect; drug screening; histology; physiology; regeneration; zebra fish; Animals; Budesonide; Cell Proliferation; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Regeneration; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",,"budesonide, 51333-22-3; Budesonide, 51333-22-3",,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: K08HD046656",,"Brockes, J.P., Kumar, A., Appendage regeneration in adult vertebrates and implications for regenerative medicine (2005) Science, 310, pp. 1919-1923; Khan, A.Z., Mudan, S.S., Liver regeneration: Mechanisms, mysteries and more (2007) ANZ J.

However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools.Results: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop 3D printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns.Conclusions: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding 3D models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3D printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users. Finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods. © 2014 Wittbrodt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","3D printing; High content screening; Orientation tool; Zebrafish screening","3D printers; Automation; Design; Gene expression; Printing; Three dimensional; 3-D printing; Automated screening; Comparative analysis; Cost-effective methods; High-content screening; Reporter-gene expression; Screening application; Zebrafish; Tools; agarose; sepharose; transcriptome; article; automated zebrafish screening assay; automation; bioassay; bioprinting; cost effectiveness analysis; embryo; gene expression; image processing; nonhuman; phenotype; reporter gene; screening test; zebra fish; animal; animal embryo; automation; chemistry; growth, development and aging; metabolism; three dimensional printing; Danio rerio; Vertebrata; Animals; Automation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Genes, Reporter; Phenotype; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Sepharose; Transcriptome; Zebrafish",,"agarose, 9012-36-6; sepharose, 61970-08-9; Sepharose",,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 305608","We thank Stefan Giselbrecht (Institute for Biological Interfaces, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany) for helpful discussions and Jens Fahrenberg (Innovation Department, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany) for general support.

One compound (of 1536 screened) induced a dramatic increase in the pigmentation of early stage zebrafish embryos. This compound, PPA, was also found to increase pigmentation in cultured mammalian melanocytes. The cellular target was identified as the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (ATPase) by affinity chromatography. Oligomycin, a small molecule known to inhibit the mitochondrial ATPase, competed with PPA for its cellular target in melanocytes. In addition, PPA was shown to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria, consistent with inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase. Thus, PPA has been successfully used as a chemical probe in a forward chemical genetic approach to establish a link between the phenotype and the protein. The results attest to the power of screening small molecule libraries in zebrafish as a means of identifying mammalian targets and suggest the mitochondrial ATPase as a target for modulating pigmentation in both melanocytes and melanoma cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005.",,"F1F0 ATP synthase; F1F0-ATP synthase; melanin; mitochondrial protein; oligomycin; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; triazine derivative; zebrafish protein; amino acid sequence; animal; animal embryo; article; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell membrane potential; drug antagonism; melanocyte; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane; molecular genetics; mouse; physiology; skin pigmentation; zebra fish; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Melanins; Melanocytes; Membrane Potentials; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondrial Membranes; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligomycins; Skin Pigmentation; Triazines; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Danio rerio; Mammalia",,"melanin, 8049-97-6; oligomycin, 1404-19-9; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase, 37205-63-3; F1F0-ATP synthase, EC 3.6.1.-; Melanins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases, EC 3.6.3.-; Oligomycins; Triazines; Zebrafish Proteins",,,"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS: R01AR041880",,"Gilchrest, B., Fitzpatrick, T., Anderson, R., Parrish, J., Br.

Here, we use yeast and zebrafish, as well as human in vitro systems, to assess the biological activity of 5-nitrofurans, and we identify a conserved interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 and 5-nitrofurans across these species. In addition, we show that the activity of nifurtimox, a 5-nitrofuran anti-trypanosome prodrug, is dependent on zebrafish Aldh2 and is a substrate for human ALDH2. This study reveals a conserved and biologically relevant ALDH2-5-nitrofuran interaction that may have important implications for managing the toxicity of 5-nitrofuran treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,"5 nitrofuran; aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2; antitrypanosomal agent; br 00087; btb 05727; btb 13657; daidzin; disulfiram; glyceryl trinitrate; nifurtimox; nitrofuran derivative; sew 00138; unclassified drug; animal cell; antimicrobial activity; antiprotozoal activity; article; controlled study; drug activity; drug protein binding; enzyme metabolism; enzyme substrate; human; human cell; in vitro study; nonhuman; protein expression; species diversity; yeast; zebra fish; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Melanocytes; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Nitrofurans; Recombinant Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Species Specificity; Structure-Activity Relationship; Zebrafish; Bacteria (microorganisms); Danio rerio",,"5 nitrofuran, 609-39-2; daidzin, 552-66-9; disulfiram, 97-77-8; glyceryl trinitrate, 55-63-0; nifurtimox, 23256-30-6; ALDH2 protein, human, 1.2.1.3; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, 1.2.1.3; Nitrofurans; Recombinant Proteins","br 00087; btb 05727; btb 13657; sew 00138","Enzo Life Sciences","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM056988; Wellcome Trust, WT; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 233457; Medical Research Council, MRC: G120/875, MC_PC_U127585840, MC_U127585840; Royal Society; Cancer Research UK, CRUK; Medical Research Scotland, MRS; European Research Council, ERC","We are grateful to I.

Within this assay, automated image acquisition procedures and custom image analysis protocols are used to quantify body length, heart rate, circulation, pericardial area, and intersegmental vessel area within individual live embryos exposed from 5 to 72 hours post-fertilization. After ranking developmental toxicity data generated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) zebrafish teratogenesis assay, we screened 26 of the most acutely toxic chemicals within EPA's ToxCast Phase-I library in concentration-response format (0.05-50 μM) using this HCS assay. Based on this screen, we identified butafenacil as a potent inducer of anemia, as exposure from 0.39 to 3.125 μM butafenacil completely abolished arterial circulation in the absence of effects on all other endpoints evaluated. Butafenacil is an herbicide that inhibits protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) - an enzyme necessary for heme production in vertebrates. Using o -dianisidine staining, we then revealed that severe butafenacil-induced anemia in zebrafish was due to a complete loss of hemoglobin following exposure during early development. Therefore, six additional PPO inhibitors within the ToxCast Phase-I library were screened to determine whether anemia represents a common adverse outcome for these herbicides. Embryonic exposure to only one of these PPO inhibitors - flumioxazin - resulted in a similar phenotype as butafenacil, albeit not as severe as butafenacil. Overall, this study highlights the potential utility of this assay for (1) screening chemicals for cardiovascular toxicity and (2) prioritizing chemicals for future hypothesis-driven and mechanism-focused investigations within zebrafish and mammalian models. © 2014 Leet et al.",,"butafenacil; flumioxazin; herbicide; unclassified drug; butafenacil; enhanced green fluorescent protein; fluorinated hydrocarbon; green fluorescent protein; pollutant; pyrimidine derivative; adult; anemia; animal experiment; animal model; arterial circulation; article; body height; cardiotoxicity; concentration response; controlled study; developmental toxicity; embryo; female; heart rate; image analysis; male; nonhuman; pericardium; teratogenesis; teratogenicity; toxicity testing; transgenic zebrafish; anemia; animal; animal embryo; cardiovascular system; chemically induced; drug effects; endothelium cell; genetics; human; pathology; pollutant; toxicity; transgenic animal; United States; vascular endothelium; zebra fish; Anemia; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cardiovascular System; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Vascular; Environmental Pollutants; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Pyrimidines; United States; Zebrafish",,"butafenacil; enhanced green fluorescent protein; Environmental Pollutants; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Pyrimidines",,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 202013",,"Collins, F.S., Gray, G.M., Bucher, J.R., Transforming environmental health protection (2008) Science, 319 (5865), pp. 906-907. , DOI 10.1126/science.1154619; Dix, D.J., Houck, K.A., Martin, M.T., Richard, A.M., Setzer, R.W., Kavlock, R.J., The toxcast program for prioritizing toxicity testing of environmental chemicals (2007) Toxicological Sciences, 95 (1), pp. 5-12. , DOI 10.1093/toxsci/kfl103; (2007) Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, p. 196. , NRC, editor Washington, DC: National Academies Press; Belanger, S.E., Balon, E.K., Rawlings, J.M., Saltatory ontogeny of fishes and sensitive early life stages for ecotoxicology tests (2010) Aquatic Toxicology, 97, pp. 88-95; Embry, M.R., Belanger, S.E., Braunbeck, T.A., Galay-Burgos, M., Halder, M., The fish embryo toxicity test as an animal alternative method in hazard and risk assessment and scientific research (2010) Aquatic Toxicology, 97, pp. 79-87; Halder, M., Leonard, M., Iguchi, T., Oris, J.T., Ryder, K., Regulatory aspects on the use of fish embryos in environmental toxicology (2010) Integr Environ Assess Manag, 6, pp. 484-491; Scholz, S., Fischer, S., Gundel, U., Kuster, E., Luckenbach, T., The zebrafish embryo model in environmental risk assessment-applications beyond acute toxicity testing (2008) Environ Sci Pollut Res Int, 15, pp. 394-404; Yozzo, K.L., Isales, G.M., Raftery, T.D., Volz, D.C., High-content screening assay for identification of chemicals impacting cardiovascular function in zebrafish embryos (2013) Environ Sci Technol, 47, pp. 11302-11310; Letamendia, A., Quevedo, C., Ibarbia, I., Virto, J.M., Holgado, O., Development and validation of an automated high-throughput system for zebrafish in vivo screenings (2012) PLoS One, 7, pp. e36690; Tran, T.C., Sneed, B., Haider, J., Blavo, D., White, A., Aiyejorun, T., Baranowski, T.C., Sandberg, E.M., Automated, quantitative screening assay for antiangiogenic compounds using transgenic zebrafish (2007) Cancer Research, 67 (23), pp. 11386-11392. , http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/67/23/11386, DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3126; Vogt, A., Cholewinski, A., Shen, X., Nelson, S.G., Lazo, J.S., Automated image-based phenotypic analysis in zebrafish embryos (2009) Developmental Dynamics, 238, pp. 656-663; Padilla, S., Corum, D., Padnos, B., Hunter, D.L., Beam, A., Zebrafish developmental screening of the ToxCast Phase I chemical library (2012) Reproductive Toxicology, 33, pp. 174-187; Lawson, N.D., Weinstein, B.M., In vivo imaging of embryonic vascular development using transgenic zebrafish (2002) Developmental Biology, 248 (2), pp. 307-318. , DOI 10.1006/dbio.2002.0711; Kimmel, C.B., Ballard, W.W., Kimmel, S.R., Ullmann, B., Schilling, T.F., Stages of Embryonic-Development of the Zebrafish (1995) Developmental Dynamics, 203, pp. 253-310; (2007) Guidelines for Use of Zebrafish in the NIH Intramural Research Program, , NIH; Paffett-Lugassy, N.N., Zon, L.I., Analysis of hematopoietic development in the zebrafish (2005) Methods Mol Med, 105, pp. 171-198; Truong, L., Reif, D.M., St Mary, L., Geier, M.C., Truong, H.D., Multidimensional in vivo hazard assessment using zebrafish (2014) Toxicol Sci, 137, pp. 212-233; Van Den Bulck, K., Hill, A., Mesens, N., Diekman, H., De Schaepdrijver, L., Zebrafish developmental toxicity assay: A fishy solution to reproductive toxicity screening, or just a red herring?

High-throughput technologies adapted from other disciplines (e.g., high-throughput chemical screening, genomics) are changing the scale of data acquisition in behavioral neuroscience. Massive behavioral datasets are beginning to emerge, particularly from zebrafish labs, where behavioral assays can be performed rapidly and reproducibly in 96-well, high-throughput format. Mining these datasets and making comparisons across different assays are major challenges for the field. Here, we review behavioral barcoding, a process by which complex behavioral assays are reduced to a string of numeric features, facilitating analysis and comparison within and across datasets. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemobehavioral data; Data-intensive digital phenotyping; Dataset mining; High-thoughput screen; Neuroscience; Pharmacology","Chemobehavioral data; Data sets; High-thoughput screen; Neuroscience; Pharmacology; Phenotyping; Biotechnology; phenethylamine derivative; acoustic analysis; algorithm; behavioral barcoding; behavioral science; bioinformatics; clinical data repository; computer analysis; computer graphics; data analysis; data mining; drug screening; drug targeting; functional genomics; gene sequence; genetic correlation; genetic database; high throughput screening; human; information processing; Internet; laboratory; learning; microarray analysis; mobile phone; molecular genetics; neuropharmacology; neuroscience; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; proteomics; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; review; scientist; stimulus; videorecording; zebra fish; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Drug Discovery; Neuropharmacology; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",,,,,"238821; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: K01MH091449, R01MH086867, R21MH085205; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: T32HL007208; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants K01MH091449 (D.K.), T32HL07208 (A.J.R.), MH086867 and MH085205 (R.T.P.), the BOLD Marie Curie Initial Training Network grant 238821 (A.H.S.), the KIT Biointerfaces program (U.L.), and by the Charles and Ann MGH Research Scholars Award (R.T.P.).","Kokel, D., Peterson, R.T., Chemobehavioural phenomics and behaviour-based psychiatric drug discovery in the zebrafish (2008) Brief.

Our goal was to generate novel compounds that might modulate transforming growth factor-β signaling, based on limited rational design. Potassium vinyl trifluoroborates react with salicylaldehydes at 80 °C in the presence of a secondary amine and produce 2-substituted 2H-chromene derivatives with a 70-90% yield. A small library of these compounds, predicted to potentially interact with transforming growth factor-β receptors, was screened for bioactivity in living zebrafish embryos. We found that the related compounds differentially affect development, and demonstrate one compound that produces severe body axis alterations in early embryogenesis and at lower doses affects specifically cardiovascular development. This compound modulates specifically a Smad-independent transforming growth factor-β-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, namely p-SAPK/JNK. These compounds, as suggested by our biological assays, may prove useful to manipulate developmental programs and develop therapeutic tools. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.","Biological screening; Chemical biology; Chemical genetics; Chemical structure; Kinase/phosphatase","chromene derivative; mitogen activated protein kinase; salicylaldehyde; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta receptor; animal experiment; article; bioassay; controlled study; drug activity; drug screening; embryo; embryo development; library; motivation; new genus; nonhuman; priority journal; zebra fish; Animals; Benzopyrans; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Embryonic Development; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Signal Transduction; Small Molecule Libraries; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",,"mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; salicylaldehyde, 90-02-8; Benzopyrans; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Small Molecule Libraries",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL056182, R01HL064282",,"Lokey, R.S., Forward chemical genetics: Progress and obstacles on the path to a new pharmacopoeia (2003) Curr Opin Chem Biol, 7, pp. 91-96; Mitchison, T.J., Towards a pharmacological genetics (1994) Chem Biol, 1, pp. 3-6; Schreiber, S.L., Chemical genetics resulting from a passion for synthetic organic chemistry (1998) Bioorg Med Chem, 6, pp. 1127-1152; Specht, K.M., Shokat, K.M., The emerging power of chemical genetics (2002) Curr Opin Cell Biol, 14, pp. 155-159; Tan, D.S., Sweet surrender to chemical genetics (2002) Nat Biotechnol, 20, pp. 561-563; MacRae, C.A., Peterson, R.T., Zebrafish-based small molecule discovery (2003) Chem Biol, 10, pp. 901-908; Peterson, R.T., Link, B.A., Dowling, J.E., Schreiber, S.L., Small molecule developmental screens reveal the logic and timing of vertebrate development (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 97, pp. 12965-12969; Flanders, K.C., Burmester, J.K., Medical applications of transforming growth factor-β (2003) Clin Med Res, 1, pp. 13-20; Massague, J., Blain, S.W., Lo, R.S., TGF-β signaling in growth control, cancer, and heritable disorders (2000) Cell, 103, pp. 295-309; Massague, J., Chen, Y.G., Controlling TGF-β signaling (2000) Genes Dev, 14, pp. 627-644; Massague, J., Wotton, D., Transcriptional control by the TGF-β/Smad signaling system (2000) EMBO J, 19, pp. 1745-1754; Roberts, A., Sporn, M., Peptide growth factors and their receptors (1995) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, pp. 419-472. , In: Sporn, M., Roberts, A., editors.

Library quality was assessed at key synthetic stages, culminating in a detailed postsynthesis analysis of purity, yield, and structural characterizability, and the resynthesis of library subsets that did not meet quality standards. The importance of this analysis-resynthesis process is highlighted by the discovery of new biological probes through organismal and protein binding assays, and by determination of the building block and stereochemical basis for their bioactivity. This evaluation of a portion of the 1,3-dioxane library suggests that many additional probes for chemical genetics will be identified as the entire library becomes biologically annotated.",,"amine; calmodulin; dioxane derivative; animal; article; chemical structure; chemistry; combinatorial chemistry; metabolism; methodology; prenatal development; stereoisomerism; surface plasmon resonance; synthesis; zebra fish; Amines; Animals; Calmodulin; Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques; Dioxanes; Molecular Structure; Stereoisomerism; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Zebrafish",,"Amines; Calmodulin; Dioxanes",,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS; W.

Improved cyanide antidotes are needed, but the ideal biological pathways to target are not known. To understand better the metabolic effects of cyanide and to discover novel cyanide antidotes, we developed a zebrafish model of cyanide exposure and scaled it for high-throughput chemical screening. In a screen of 3120 small molecules, we discovered 4 novel antidotes that block cyanide toxicity. The most potent antidote was riboflavin. Metabolomic profiling of cyanide-treated zebrafish revealed changes in bile acid and purine metabolism, most notably by an increase in inosine levels. Riboflavin normalizes many of the cyanide-induced neurological and metabolic perturbations in zebrafish. The metabolic effects of cyanide observed in zebrafish were conserved in a rabbit model of cyanide toxicity. Further, humans treated with nitroprusside, a drug that releases nitric oxide and cyanide ions, display increased circulating bile acids and inosine. In summary, riboflavin may be a novel treatment for cyanide toxicity and prophylactic measure during nitroprusside treatment, inosine may serve as a biomarker of cyanide exposure, and metabolites in the bile acid and purine metabolism pathways may shed light on the pathways critical to reversing cyanide toxicity.","Inosine; Mitochondria; Riboflavin; Zebrafish","bile acid; carbohydrate; carboplatin; cisplatin; cyanide; glycochenodeoxycholic acid; hydroxocobalamin; inosine; methotrexate; nitric oxide; nitroprusside sodium; purine; riboflavin; animal experiment; animal model; article; bile acid metabolism; brain stem; clinical article; cyanide toxicity; electron transport; energy metabolism; heart rate variability; high throughput screening; human; in vivo study; intoxication; metabolomics; motor activity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; prophylaxis; purine metabolism; spinal cord; survival; visual stimulation; Animals; Antidotes; Bile Acids and Salts; Biological Markers; Cyanides; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Heart Failure; Humans; Inosine; Metabolomics; Nitroprusside; Rabbits; Riboflavin; Zebrafish; Danio rerio; Oryctolagus cuniculus",,"carboplatin, 41575-94-4; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; cyanide, 57-12-5; glycochenodeoxycholic acid, 640-79-9; hydroxocobalamin, 13422-51-0, 13422-52-1; inosine, 58-63-9; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitroprusside sodium, 14402-89-2, 15078-28-1; purine, 120-73-0; riboflavin, 83-88-5; Antidotes; Bile Acids and Salts; Biological Markers; Cyanides; Inosine, 58-63-9; Nitroprusside, 15078-28-1; Riboflavin, 83-88-5",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K99HL112724, T32HL007208; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: U01NS058030, U54NS063718, U54NS079201",,"Gracia, R., Shepherd, G., Cyanide poisoning and its treatment (2004) Pharmacotherapy, 24, pp. 1358-1365; Alcorta, R., Smoke inhalation & acute cyanide poisoning (2004) Hydrogen Cyanide Poisoning Proves Increasingly Common in Smoke-inhalation Victims.

In zebrafish, homozygous deletion of the cdx4 gene results in a mutant phenotype known as kugelig, with aberrant A-P patterning and severe anemia characterized by decreased gata1 expression in the posterior lateral mesoderm. To identify pathways that interact with cdx4 during primitive hematopoiesis, we conducted a chemical genetic screen in the cdx4 mutant background for compounds that increase gata1 expression in cdx4 mutants. Among 2640 compounds that were tested, we discovered two compounds that rescued gata1 expression in the cdx4-mutant embryos. The strongest rescue was observed with bergapten, a psoralen compound found in bergamont oil. Another member of the psoralen family, 8-methoxypsoralen, was also found to rescue gata1 expression in cdx4-mutant embryos. The psoralen compounds also disrupted normal A-P patterning of embryos. These compounds modify the cdx4-mutant phenotype and will help elucidate signaling pathways that act downstream or parallel to the cdx4-hox pathway. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"cdx4 protein, zebrafish; homeodomain protein; zebrafish protein; animal; article; drug effect; drug screening; female; gene expression regulation; genetic screening; genetics; hematopoiesis; male; metabolism; morphogenesis; phenotype; prenatal development; signal transduction; zebra fish; Animals; Body Patterning; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Testing; Hematopoiesis; Homeodomain Proteins; Male; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Danio rerio",,"Homeodomain Proteins; Zebrafish Proteins; cdx4 protein, zebrafish",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL048801; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: K08DK074595",,"Peterson, R.T., Shaw, S.Y., Peterson, T.A., Milan, D.J., Zhong, T.P., Schreiber, S.L., Chemical suppression of a genetic mutation in a zebrafish model of aortic coarctation (2004) Nat.

Because of the egg size (diameter 1.6 mm) and the relatively easy maintenance of Zebrafish farms the eggs also offer high-throughput screening (HTS). However, the current bottleneck for HTS is the cost-efficient placing of individual organisms into single wells of a multiwell plate (MWP). The system presented here is capable of storing, sorting, and placing individual organisms in a highly reproducible manner. In about 11 min a complete 96-MWP is filled, which corresponds to about 8 sec per egg. The survival rate of fertilized transgenic and wild-type eggs was comparable to the one of the control (control 6.7%, system 7.6%). Furthermore, it was also possible to place dechorionated eggs into individual wells. The results demonstrate that the cost efficient system works gentle and reliable enough to disburden scientists from the exhausting and monotonous job of placing single eggs into single wells, such that they can concentrate on the scientific aspects of their experiments and create results with a higher statistical relevance. © 2011 by the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.","Automated; Cell sorting; Danio rerio; Multiwell plate; Toxicity testing; Zebrafish","Animals; Toxicity; Automated; Cell sorting; Danio rerio; Multi wells; Toxicity testing; Zebrafish; Biology; article; cell selection; computer interface; computer system; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; data analysis software; embryo; equipment design; imaging system; instrument validation; laboratory automation; microfluidic analysis; nonhuman; reliability; reproducibility; survival rate; wild type; zebra fish; zygote",,,"ZebraFactor",,,,"Lilienblum, W., Dekant, W., Foth, H., Gebel, T., Hengstler, J., Kahl, R., Kramer, P.J., Wollin, K.M., Alternative methods to safety studies in experimental animals: Role in the risk assessment of chemicals under the new European Chemicals Legislation (REACH) (2008) Arch.

However, the isolation of sufficient amounts of these low abundant constituents for structural modification has been a challenge for several decades and subsequently halts research on the utilization of this important source of chemical entities for drug discovery and development. And, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiocerebral vascular diseases and wound healing recently. The present study investigates the pro-angiogenic potential of tanshinone derivatives produced by one-pot synthesis using zebrafish model. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to address the difficulty of chemical modification of low abundant constituents in herb medicines, a novel one-pot combinatorial modification was used to diversify a partially purified tanshinone mixture from Salvia miltiorrhiza. This led to the isolation of ten new imidazole-tanshinones (Compounds 1-10) and one oxazoletanshinone (Compound 11), the structures of which were characterized by spectroscopic methods in combination with single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. The angiogenesis activities of the new tanshinone derivatives were determined in an experimental model of chemical-induced blood vessels damage in zebrafish. Of all the tested new derivatives, compound 10 exhibited the most potent vascular protective and restorative activity with an EC50 value of 0.026 μM. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the pro-angiogenesis effect of 10 probably involved the VEGF/FGF-Src-MAPK and PI3K-P38 signalling pathways by gene expression analysis and a blocking assay with pathways-specific kinase inhibitors. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, our study demonstrated the more distinctive pro-angiogenic properties of 10 than other tanshinones and revealed 10 has potential for development as a pro-angiogenic agent for diseases associated with insufficient angiogenesis. Our results highlighted the great potential of adopting a newly modified one-pot approach to enhance the chemical diversity and biological activities of constituents from natural products regardless of their abundances. © 2014 Zhang et al.",,"3 [4 methyl 2 (2 oxo 3 indolinylmethylidenyl) 3 pyrrolyl]propionic acid;

Exposure to organophosphates, either through accidents or acts of terrorism, poses a significant risk to human health and safety. Existing antidotes, in use for over 50 years, have modest efficacy and undesirable toxicities. Therefore, discovering new organophosphate antidotes is a high priority. Early life stage zebrafish exposed to organophosphates exhibit several phenotypes that parallel the human response to organophosphates, including behavioral deficits, paralysis, and eventual death. Here, we have developed a high-throughput zebrafish screen in a 96-well plate format to find new antidotes that counteract organophosphate-induced lethality. In a pilot screen of 1200 known drugs, we identified 16 compounds that suppress organophosphate toxicity in zebrafish. Several in vitro assays coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling enabled determination of mechanisms of action for several of the antidotes, including reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cholinergic receptor antagonism, and inhibition of bioactivation. Therefore, the in vivo screen is capable of discovering organophosphate antidotes that intervene in distinct pathways. These findings suggest that zebrafish screens might be a broadly applicable approach for discovering compounds that counteract the toxic effects of accidental or malicious poisonous exposures. © 2013 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.","high-content screening; in vivo screening; mass spectrometry; Xenopus; zebrafish","amiloride; antidote; atropine; bucladesine; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; cholinesterase inhibitor; emetine; glycopyrronium bromide; harmaline; mephenesin; metoclopramide; nadolol; nalidixic acid; nifuroxazide; nipecotic acid; ondansetron; organophosphate; rifampicin; salbutamol; telenzepine; animal experiment; article; controlled study; drug screening; embryo; high throughput screening; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liquid chromatography; nonhuman; phenotype; pilot study; priority journal; tandem mass spectrometry; zebra fish; Animals; Antidotes; Atropine; Cell Line, Tumor; Cholinergic Antagonists; Cholinesterase Reactivators; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Emetine; Glycopyrrolate; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Lethal Dose 50; Metoclopramide; Neostigmine; Organophosphates; Parathion; Pirenzepine; Pralidoxime Compounds; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",,"amiloride, 2016-88-8, 2609-46-3; atropine, 51-55-8, 55-48-1; bucladesine, 16980-89-5, 362-74-3; emetine, 316-42-7, 483-18-1; glycopyrronium bromide, 596-51-0; harmaline, 304-21-2; mephenesin, 59-47-2; metoclopramide, 12707-59-4, 2576-84-3, 364-62-5, 7232-21-5; nadolol, 42200-33-9; nalidixic acid, 389-08-2; nifuroxazide, 965-52-6; nipecotic acid, 498-95-3; ondansetron, 103639-04-9, 116002-70-1, 99614-01-4; rifampicin, 13292-46-1; salbutamol, 18559-94-9, 35763-26-9; telenzepine, 80880-90-6; Antidotes; Atropine, 51-55-8; Cholinergic Antagonists; Cholinesterase Reactivators; Emetine, 483-18-1; Glycopyrrolate, 596-51-0; Metoclopramide, 364-62-5; Neostigmine, 59-99-4; Organophosphates; Parathion, 56-38-2; Pirenzepine, 28797-61-7; Pralidoxime Compounds; pralidoxime, P7MU9UTP52; telenzepine, 0990EG3K10",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: K01MH091449; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: T32HL007208; NIH Office of the Director, OD; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: U01NS063733, U54NS079201","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Supported by the CounterACT Program, Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (OD) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Grant Number U01 NS063733 to RTP.","Albuquerque, E.X., Pereira, E.F., Aracava, Y., Fawcett, W.P., Oliveira, M., Randall, W.R., Hamilton, T.A., Adler, M., Effective Countermeasure against Poisoning by Organophosphorus Insecticides and Nerve Agents (2006) Proc.

We have recently described the implementation of a quantitative, high-content imaging assay in multi-well plates to analyze the effects of small molecules on Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling in vivo. Here we have evaluated the capability of the assay to identify compounds that hyperactivate FGF signaling from a test cassette of agents with known biological activities. Using a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for FGF activity, we screened 1040 compounds from an annotated library of known bioactive agents, including FDA-approved drugs. The assay identified two molecules, 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate and pyrithione zinc, that enhanced FGF signaling in specific areas of the brain. Subsequent studies revealed that both compounds specifically expanded FGF target gene expression. Furthermore, treatment of early stage embryos with either compound resulted in dorsalized phenotypes characteristic of hyperactivation of FGF signaling in early development. Documented activities for both agents included activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), consistent with FGF hyperactivation. To conclude, we demonstrate the power of automated quantitative high-content imaging to identify small molecule modulators of FGF. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","FGF modulators; High-content analysis; Small molecule;

We carried out a zebrafish-based phenotypic screen of over 3000 plant-derived secondary metabolite extracts with the goal of identifying novel small-molecule modulators of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways. One of the bioactive plant extracts identified in this screen - Jasminum gilgianum, an Oleaceae species native to Papua New Guinea - induced ectopic tails during zebrafish embryonic development. As ectopic tail formation occurs when BMP or non-canonical Wnt signaling is inhibited during the tail protrusion process, we suspected a constituent of this extract to act as a modulator of these pathways. A bioassay-guided isolation was carried out on the basis of this zebrafish phenotype, identifying para-coumaric acid methyl ester (pCAME) as the active compound. We then performed an in-depth phenotypic analysis of pCAME-treated zebrafish embryos, including a tissue-specific marker analysis of the secondary tails. We found pCAME to synergize with the BMP-inhibitors dorsomorphin and LDN-193189 in inducing ectopic tails, and causing convergence-extension defects in compound-treated embryos. These results indicate that pCAME may interfere with non-canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of Jnk, a downstream target of Wnt/PCP signaling (via morpholino antisense knockdown and pharmacological inhibition with the kinase inhibitor SP600125) phenocopied pCAME-treated embryos. However, immunoblotting experiments revealed pCAME to not directly inhibit Jnk-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun, suggesting additional targets of SP600125, and/or other pathways, as possibly being involved in the ectopic tail formation activity of pCAME. Further investigation of pCAME's mechanism of action will help determine this compound's pharmacological utility. © 2013 Gebruers et al.",,"4 coumaric acid methyl ester; anisomycin; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; antisense oligonucleotide; bone morphogenetic protein; bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor; dorsomorphin; ester derivative; Jasminum gilgianum extract; ldn 193189; morpholino oligonucleotide; plant extract; protein c jun; protein inhibitor; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; (6-(4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl))-3-pyridin-4-ylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidine; 4-coumaric acid methyl ester; 6 [4 (1 piperazinyl)phenyl] 3 (4 quinolinyl)pyrazolo[1,5 a]pyrimidine; coumaric acid; pyrazole derivative; pyrimidine derivative; zebrafish protein; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bioassay; BMP signaling pathway; congenital malformation; controlled study; drug mechanism; drug structure; ectopic tail formation; embryo; embryo development; enzyme inhibition; female; gene silencing; human; human cell; immunoblotting; isolation procedure; Jasminum gilgianum; male; native species; nonhuman; Oleaceae; Papua New Guinea; PCP signaling pathway; pharmacological blocking; phenotype; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; structure analysis; tail; Wnt signaling pathway; zebra fish; animal; animal embryo; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; drug effects; drug screening; embryology; jasmine; metabolism; Wnt signaling pathway; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Coumaric Acids; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Jasminum; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Tail; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",,"anisomycin, 22862-76-6; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one, 129-56-6; stress activated protein kinase, 155215-87-5; 6 [4 (1 piperazinyl)phenyl] 3 (4 quinolinyl)pyrazolo[1,5 a]pyrimidine, 1062368-24-4; coumaric acid, 25429-38-3; (6-(4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl))-3-pyridin-4-ylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidine; 4-coumaric acid methyl ester; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Coumaric Acids; LDN 193189; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Zebrafish Proteins",,"Frinton, United States",,,"Bohni, N., Cordero-Maldonado, M.L., Maes, J., Siverio-Mota, D., Marcourt, L., Integration of Microfractionation, qNMR and Zebrafish Screening for the In Vivo Bioassay-Guided Isolation and Quantitative Bioactivity Analysis of Natural Products (2013) PLOS ONE, 8, pp. e64006. , doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064006.

The zebrafish provides an excellent model system for juxtaposing developmental phenotypes with mechanism discovery using organism genetics. We carried out a phenotype-based screen of uncharacterized small molecules in zebrafish that produced a variety of chemically induced phenotypes with potential genetic parallels. Specifically, kalihinol F caused an undulated notochord, defects in pigment formation, hematopoiesis, and neural development. These phenotypes were strikingly similar to the zebrafish mutant, calamity, an established model of copper deficiency.

It should be possible to identify novel retinoids by coupling new chemical reactions with screens using the zebrafish embryonic model. Principal Findings: We synthesized novel retinoid analogues and derivatives by amide coupling, obtaining 80-92% yields. A small library of these compounds was screened for bioactivity in living zebrafish embryos. We found that several structurally related compounds significantly affect development. Distinct phenotypes are generated depending on time of exposure, and we characterize one compound (BT10) that produces specific cardiovascular defects when added 1 day post fertilization. When compared to retinoic acid (ATRA), BT10 shows similar but not identical changes in the expression pattern of embryonic genes that are known targets of the retinoid pathway. Reporter assays determined that BT10 interacts with all three RAR receptor sub-types, but has no activity for RXR receptors, at all concentrations tested. Conclusions: Our screen has identified a novel retinoid with specificity for retinoid receptors. This lead compound may be useful for manipulating components of retinoid signaling networks, and may be further derivatized for enhanced activity. © 2010 Das et al.",,"[3,7 dimethyl 9 (2,6,6 trimethyl 1 cyclohexenyl)nona 2,4,6,8 tetraenoylamino] (4 alcohol)phenylamide;
